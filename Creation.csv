0,www.DesignMate.com video that highlights a major problem for the origin of life,0,True,"[cross posted at
http://creationevolutionuniversity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=180]


[EDIT: the major problem is mRNA translation and all that is need for it.  The critical step is mRNA translation.]

I don't think it was the intent of the company called DesignMate to promote Intelligent Design (ID), but they unwittingly do so anyway!

One of their 5-minute educational videos shows a critical step that must be solved by the origin of life.  

Creationists who are serious about the creation/evolution/ID can learn a lot from watching this 5-minute video several times over.  Learning biochemistry and molecular biology is like studying a phonebook, there is a lot of rote memorization of boring names.

You can get the gist of one of the major difficulties in the origin of life problem by watching this 5-minute video.  If you watch it 20 times, and start memorizing the terms, that's actually a good way to learn biochemistry!  Learning biochemistry is often like learning a phonebook, which is more about how much punishment by rote memorization you're willing to suffer through than one's deductive/mathematical intellect.

Chemical names are just names with lots of syllables.  Don't be intimidated by names.  ""A rose is a rose by any other name"" to quote Shakespeare.

Studying this 5-minute video was worth more than the collective years of my life I wasted studying evolutionary biology.

For beginners, some basic facts first: 

DNA tranSCRIBES to a pre-RNA which is edited/processed into an mRNA.

Then the mRNA transLATES to a protein.

This video shows the translation of mRNA to a protein.  Each of the steps in the video has to be in place for life to exist.  A half formed translation system won't work as the organism will be dead.  Dead things don't evolve!

Here is the 5-minute video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrUzDYAmEI

One of my complaiints with the video is that it depicts a protein as being only 5 amino acids long. The average length of a protein in animals is on the order of 400 amino acids!  A mystery, not solved in the video is how the correct tRNA is recruited, but that's some advanced stuff!

**NOTES for ADVANCED STUDENTS**
The video shows the E-P-A sites. There is a barrier to evolution of eukaryotes from prokaryotes because of the handling E-P-A sites as shown in the video are handle differently in prokaryotes (like bacteria) vs. eukaryotes (like animals).  See:

1,Best evidence against evolution?,11,True,"Hi all,

First of all, thanks to the mods for allowing me to post here — I made an alt because unfortunately questioning these sorts of things is so looked down upon. :/

I find myself skeptical of evolution since media and other groups call for such unquestioning belief. In my experience, the truth rarely requires PR or excessive social pressure. This is especially true when such groups tend toward capitalizing on falsehoods whenever possible. Perhaps many of you disagree with me, but since you're here, I also doubt you view state/corporate media as beacons of truth and justice. 

Of course, this isn't evidence on its own, but I would like to explore the issue on more than a deeper level.

I am not religious (although I share very few of the common atheist beliefs and interests); so I would really appreciate evidence against evolution that holds up without belief in God.

I understand the arguments for evolution (at least on a decently educated layman's level), so I would be interested in any arguments against. However, I am especially interested in forged or questionable evidence, media/government manipulation, etc.

Also, I am curious about opinions on the fossil record and dinosaurs.

Thanks in advance for any responses. :)

Edit: Wow, this blew up while I was afk! Thanks very much for all the replies so far. It will take a while to reply to everyone, but I really appreciate it. :)",1521808294,94,2018-03-23 08:31:34
2,Why Did God Create Nested Hierarchies that Almost Look Evolved?,6,True,"Living things can be classified into groups that form what is called a nested hierarchy.  This is used to argue for Universal Common Ancestry/Descent.  For example we and chimps are part of the group called primates which are part of the group called mammals which are part of the group called vertebrates, etc.

I give my opinion below as to why I don't believe in Universal Common Descent and why God might create life such that it can be classified into nested hierarchies and thus superficially look as if it were evolved.

7,The Shroud of Turin: An Early Easter Post...,1,True,"First, a brief justification for having this post on /r/creation.


For Christians, Christ was “with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made” (John 1:2-3).


This claim is either true or false.  If true, its bearing on the origins debate should be self-evident.


The only means I am aware of for demonstrating its truth is to demonstrate that Christ came back from the dead.  The Shroud of Turin is one way of doing that.  Additionally, the case for the Shroud’s authenticity is entirely scientific, and very powerful.


I’m not making this post to present a comprehensive argument for its authenticity, simply to inspire people to look into it because I feel that it is a genuine tragedy that more people are not aware of just how seriously it should be taken.  I’m no expert on the Shroud, but I have studied it fairly intensely for the past couple of years, and will try to answer any questions you may have.

  
In 1978, the Catholic Church gave a group of scientist unfettered access to the Shroud of Turin.  The group was called STURP (The Shroud of Turin Research Project) 

STURP **“spent over two years preparing a series of tests that would gather a vast amount of Shroud data in a relatively short period of time.** STURP's primary goal was to determine the scientific properties of the image on the Shroud of Turin, and what might have caused it. In October of 1978 **the STURP team spent 120 continuous hours [five days round the clock] conducting their examination of the Shroud”** 

-Barrie M. Schwortz, an original member of STURP and editor of The Shroud of Turin Website 


[Here is a list of the STURP team.](http://shroud.com/78team.htm)  And  [here is a list of the peer reviewed journals in which their research has been published.]( http://shroud.com/78papers.htm)

The only substantive argument against its authenticy that I am aware of is the carbon dating test conducted in 1988, but the results of that test have been conclusively shown to be unreliable because it dated a late medieval cotton repair to The Shroud along with the original linen.  [Here is a documentary narrating this events of this discovery.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_fSgPQYxkk)  (See starting around 29 min. in)


Since then, four separate dating methods have all yielded dates that overlap in the first century A.D.

Using the kinetics of vanillin: “A determination of the kinetics of vanillin suggests that the shroud is between 1300- and 3000-years old **[1,000 B.C – 700A.D.].”** From “Studies on the Radiocarbon Sample from the Shroud of Turin” (2005) by Ray Rogers in *Thermochimica Acta*

And the following three methods used by Giulio Fanti, associate professor of mechanical and thermal measurements at the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, Italy.


FT-IR vibrational spectroscopy analysis: **300 B.C. plus or minus 400 years with 95% confidence**

Raman vibrational analysis: **200 B.C. plus or minus 500 years with 95% confidence**

A measurement of the degree to which five targeted mechanical properties of flax plant fibers vary over time: **A.D. 400 plus or minus 400 years with 95% confidence**

“The mean of the values from the two chemical datings and the mechanical one indicates that the most likely date of the Shroud is **33 B.C. plus or minus 250 years with 95% confidence”**
-Giulio Fanti

The image on The Shroud is like a photo negative (reversed light and dark, reversed right and left), but it predates the development of photography by 500 years (if it is a fraud) and 1,800 years if it is authentic. 


[The VP-8 image analyzer indicates that the image contains three dimensional information.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_fSgPQYxkk)  (See starting at 7:05)

Photography does not do this.


[Most bizarrely, it even displays some aspects of an x-ray image.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iOICzBdrhc)  (See starting at 57:53)


The blood on The Shroud (not the image) corresponds to the wounds of Christ, is human, probably type AB, and “has a very high content of bilirubin…a breakdown product of hemoglobin produced in large quantities in cases of violent deaths” 
-Mark Antonacci  *The Resurrection of the Shroud*

 
Additionally, the blood was on the shroud before the image, a very powerful demonstration that it is not a fake: Why would a forger go to the trouble of putting the blood on and *then* the image when putting the image on first would give a template for where to put the blood and be just as useful for fooling people after the fact?

13,Human existence will look more and more miraculous the longer we survive -- Sabine Hossenfelder,6,True,"[cross posted at: http://creationevolutionuniversity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=174&amp;p=800#p800]

Sabine Hossenfelder is a very sharp physicist

https://twitter.com/skdh/status/974908269511798784

&gt;Human existence will look more and more miraculous the longer we survive, 

Yet, in the midst of this:
http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-multiworse-is-coming.html

&gt;“[P]article physics is currently experiencing the most serious crisis in its storied history. The feeling in the field is at best one of confusion and at worst depression”

Why? 

If the most natural thing is mathematics, then nature is unnatural. 

It may seem like contradiction to say ""nature looks unnatural"", but relative to all possible hypothetical universes, our universe is not natural.  It is like finding 500 fair coins on a table being 100% heads.  If that happened that would be a violation of ""natural"" mathematical expectation. Such is the case with the universe we live in, the numbers for nature's constants and properties are aligned in a way that violates natural expectation from all the possible hypothetical universes.

The notion of ""fine-tuning"" means the natural expectation from mathematical first principles is that the constants and properties of nature are such that scientific discovery and life are possible only under very rare sets of numbers and properties.  Most hypothetical universes will not permit the emergence of atoms more complex than hydrogen, for example.  One could then forget about life existing in most hypothetical universes.

Fine-tuning is uncomfortably close to the suggestion of our present reality being a mathematical miracle, far from natural expectation.  Scientists were hoping for a ""natural"" explanation for fine tuning rather than a miraculous one.  Alas, this has failed:

&gt;What the particle physicists got wrong was an argument based on a mathematical criterion called “naturalness”. If the laws of nature were “natural” according to this definition, then the LHC should have seen something besides the Higgs. The data analysis isn’t yet completed, but at this point it seems unlikely something more than statistical anomalies will show up. 

&gt;I must have sat through hundreds of seminars in which naturalness arguments were repeated. Let me just flash you a representative slide from a 2007 talk by Michelangelo L. Mangano (full pdf here), so you get the idea. The punchline is at the very top: “new particles must appear” in an energy range of about a TeV (ie accessible at the LHC) “to avoid finetuning.” 


The data we have so far tells us the universe is fine-tuned, and thus looks miraculous, not natural. That is the source of a lot of depression among some physicists because nature cannot be explained by simplisitic mindless natural expectation.  This would be like expecting 500 fair coins to naturally become 100% heads when dumped randomly on a table.

26,Former Non-Creationists: What was the #1 thing that led you to creationism?,23,True,"Hi all. The past few months (and it seems it will take a huge chunk of this year) I have been extensively reading about creationism and evolution. I'm Christian and I have no stance on the origin of life and an agnostic approach towards the interpretation of the creation story in Genesis. After a couple books, I'm nowhere closer to either side quite yet.

So I just want to get an idea of what it took for some of you--who used to not be creationist--to go against the mainstream and proclaim creationism as true. Was there one particular thing that made you consciously switch sides?",1520811162,46,2018-03-11 19:32:42

32,Wagering Your Soul on the Creation Evolution Controversy,0,True,"Having won $30,000 from the casinos before being kicked out for math skills, I have an unconventional perspective on the creation/evolution controversy.  I posted my thoughts here:

http://creationevolutionuniversity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=162&amp;p=760#p760",1520446597,25,2018-03-07 13:16:37
33,"Laws of Physics, especially QM, suggests the existence of God, the Intelligent Designer and Creator",1,True,"In 2005, a distinguished professor from my graduate alma mater, Richard Conn Henry, published a short opinion piece in the prestigious scientific journal nature that said, in essence, God exists based on inferences from Quantum Mechanics alone.  

Quantum Mechanics (QM) was formulated to explain various phenomenon in chemistry.  QM led to the development of  lasers, transistors, computers, etc.  Half of the Gross National Product could be said to be dependent on the application of Quantum Mechanics whether we realize it or not.

But Quantum Mechanics, if taken to its logical conclusion, could imply the existence of God.

The great physicists John Wheeler conceived of the Double Slit Delayed Choice experiment of quantum mechanics shows that the future affects the past.  Wheeler's experiment, with some additional considerations suggests an ultimate non-material cause for all reality -- aka God.  Richard Conn Henry, Frank Tipler, John Barrow and others have concluded a straightforward interpretation of quantum mechanics implies the existence of God.

If there is a God, then it is possible miracles can happen, and I suggest then that God is the Intelligent Designer as well. Thus, independent of any religious beliefs, one could hypothetically construct an ID and creationist model of reality.  This is re-assuring as it avoids the problem of circular reasoning from purely faith beliefs without involvement of any scientific facts.

I collected various fragments of ideas by physicists regarding QM and ID and dumped it in the following essay (adapted and revised from an earlier version):

35,Convince me that observed rates of evolutionary change are insufficient to explain the past history of life on earth,5,True,"I recently made a post on genetic entropy in r/debateevolution, where u/DarwinZDF42 [argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ywyy4/can_genetic_entropy_be_historically/dum8oas/) that rather than focusing on Haldane's dilemma

&gt;we should look at actual cases of adaptation and see how long this stuff takes.

S/he then provided a few examples of observed evolutionary change.

Obviously, some evolution has been observed.

Mathematically, taking time depth, population size, generation length, etc into account, can it be proven that what we observe today (particularly for animals with larger genomes) is insufficient to explain the evolutionary changes seen in the fossil record? And how would you go about doing this?

Is there any basis to the common evolutionist quote that

&gt;The question of evolutionary change in relation to available geological time is indeed a serious theoretical challenge, but the reasons are exactly the opposite of that inspired by most people’s intuition. Organisms in general have not done nearly as much evolving as we should reasonably expect. Long term rates of change, even in lineages of unusual rapid evolution, are almost always far slower than they theoretically could be. 

This is the kind of issue that frustrates me about the creation-evolution debate because it should be matter of simple mathematics and yet I can't find a real answer.

37,Some thoughts on the psychology of C-14 dating…,12,True,"I recently ran across this quote from David Down, a well respected archaeologist:


“I’ve used carbon-14 dating…. Frankly, among archaeologists, carbon dating is a big joke. They send samples to the laboratories to be dated. If it comes back and agrees with the dates they’ve already decided from the style of pottery, they will say, “Carbon-14 dating of this sample confirms our conclusions.” But if it doesn’t agree, they just think the laboratory has got it wrong, and that’s the end of it. It’s only a showcase. **Archaeologists never (let me emphasize this) never date their finds by carbon-14. They only quote it if it agrees with their conclusions.”**



Were it not for my recent experiences researching instances of C-14 dating for dinosaur bones, I think I would have been skeptical of this claim.  Now I am not. 

 

The soft tissue in the partially fossized bones of 14 different dinosaurs has been carbon dated to between 22,000 to 39,000, well below the 50,000 year limit of the test.  As proof that these are perfectly acceptable numbers, notice that [scientists have carbon dated human and animal remains](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-chauvet-caves-timeline-20160412-story.html) found in Chauvet cave, France to between 37,000 and 33,500 years ago. 

Nobody flinches at those dates.  


Yet, after presenting their carbon dating research on eight different dinosaurs at the 2012 Western Pacific Geophysics Meeting in Singapore, the Paleochronology group received the following letter explaining why their abstract was deleted from the conference website: 



“The interpretation which you present in your abstract is that the age of various dinosaurs, previously interpreted as being Mesozoic in age, are less than ~50,000 years. Your report that these ages were calculated using C-14 methods. **There is obviously an error in these data.** The abstract was apparently not reviewed properly and was accepted in error. For this reason we have exercised our authority as program chairs and rescinded the abstract. The abstract will no longer appear on the AOGS web site.” 



*This exactly confirms what David Down said.*  Indeed, even if I didn’t know about this particular letter, I have seen the carbon date tests of dinosaur bones rejected by many for the same reasons: It’s obviously lab error; it’s obviously contamination.  


But, of course, such arguments get weaker the more these late dates are confirmed by subsequent tests.


Now contrast this “the laboratory has got it wrong” reaction with what happened when the Shroud of Turin was carbon dated.  In that case, *one small section* was removed and tested. When the medieval dates confirmed what skeptics already believed, the C-14 test carried all the weight of absolute certainty in spite of a mountain of data that confirmed the Shroud’s first century authenticity. 


Incidentally, I don’t know how many people here have looked into the Shroud of Turin, but I plan on making a post about it before Easter.  In this particular case, the sample was actually contaminated, as has been conclusively demonstrated.

42,How paleontology disproves the flood [Debunked],5,True,"This is my halfway point to debunking aronra's 8 video series disproving the flood. Well, let's go.

point 1) He presents a false dichotomy in that he insinuates that finding rock in different strata and finding fossils we'd never seen before contradicts the flood.

Response: I mean Founders effect + Variation and selection would account for this for the flood. Hydological sorting would also account for all the different strata we see in the geologic column.

point 2) We should find humans all throughout the fossil record if the flood was true.

Counterpoint: humans have a tendency to bloat when they're drowning and float to the surface, the flood waters would've also been horrifically powerful and might have just eroded what remained of the humans. This is furthered by the fact that the flood waters could've undergone rapid chemical and mineralogical change that would speed up this erosion too.

point 3: Radiometric dating falsifies the flood.

Response: no, but since this is such a complex topic, I'll just link to evidence for rapid decay [here](https://creation.com/age-of-the-earth). Essentially, stuff like soft tissue, c14, helium, argon, radiohalos, lead an other peices of evidence support rapid decay. The mechanism for this decay would be static electricity generating from moving tectonic plates causing the rapid formation of radioisotopes and they're rapid decay. This is [evidenced](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/1/44.full) by the fact that more radioisotopes exist on the surface than the sea floor, as there would've been no radioisotopes during creation week and most would've been created by the flood.

point 4: We see a general progression from simple lifeforms to complex ones in the fossil record

Response: We see a general progression from deep marine life to high elevation landlife, this is generally explained through ecological zonation. Basically, the higher the elevation of the environment an organism would've been in, the higher they would be located in strata. This is only a general theory for explaining the fossil order as this is only a general and very simplified trend. the biogeographic location, hydrological sorting and location in relation to crustal downwarp would've also played a role in the fossil order.

point 5: The [western interior seaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interior_Seaway) cannot have been formed by the flood

Response: From what I can find and what Ra has mentioned, the main evidence for this are a series of marine environments found entirely surrounded and encased by terrestrial environments. I'm not a flood geologist, so I cannot be certain in this judgment but knowing what I know about flood geology, perhaps these environments were uprooted by either the direct actions of the spring jets if you believe in HPT and by hot steams if you believe in CPT. This would've uprooted the ecosystems in question and would've caused them to be deposited near the cretaceous. 

Point 6: Coral formation takes to long for the earth to be 6k years old

Response: Coral clocks (using growth rings) are unreliable according to [this](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036289) study, were the authors measured the rate of coral growth year over year for 50 years. They found that disease was a huge factor in prohibiting growth and actually diminishing the growth of the coral, they also found that little change in growth happened in between about 1980-2010. Coral growth rates are highly variable and grow best in disease free and warm enironments with a lot of sunlight. Theoretically, after the flood, heat from volcanism and moving tectonic plates would be distributed all across the earth (ignorant of the polar ice caps) while a subsiding post flood sea level might've caused coral to be exposed to much more light than it would now. Water currents bringing in sediment and storms adding on coral can also dramatically. An example of this is in 1972, [cyclone bebe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17744290) deposited coral rubble 3.5m high, 37m wide and 18km long in just a few hours. Conditions like these would be abundant during the receeding stages of the flood and for some time after, were water of the continents would transport huge loads of sediments to these reefs and the uptick in catastrophic storms post flood would also transport a lot of sediment to these areas. Some reef growth rates have been reported as high 414mm per year (in the celebes). At such high rates, coral reefs like Eniwetok Atoll, which is mentioned by Ra, could grow in just 3500 years which is fully consistent with YEC chronology.
 
point 7: Flood conditions are not favorable for corals due to all the sediment being moved around.

Response: sure, the immediate receeding stage of the flood would disperse a lot of sediment everywhere, but the currents would've mostly dropped these sediments in ocean basins with a good chunk being suspended in the ocean. Now if Ra could quantify how much sediment would be needed to stunt coral growth, that would be great. But for now, it seems like the ocean basins dropping and the receeding currents dropping sediments into these areas would be fine enough to allow coral to grow afterward.

point 8: Fossilized coral reefs falsify the noachian flood

Response: Fossilized ""reefs"" and the coral reefs we see today have lots of keen differences that make us question whether fossilized reefs really are just that. Modern reefs, like the great barrier reefs, contain vast amount of cemented skeletal remains from sea floor animals, mainly corals which grow overtime on the remnants and debris of their predecessors. This is opposed to fossilized reefs which are very small tons of different kinds of organisms when compared to present day reefs. A lot of fossilized reefs have a lot of there own individual problems, so I'll just link to an [article](https://answersingenesis.org/fossils/how-are-fossils-formed/ancient-fossil-reefs-formed-in-the-flood/) detailing a lot of the problems with various specific fossilized reefs we find all over the world.

point 9: The coconino sandstone contradicts the flood because deserts cannot form during floods.

Response: Creation scientist actually produced a petrology [report](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/rock-layers/petrology-of-the-coconino-sandstone/) on the coconino sandstone back in 2014. This is the only such petrology report that actually exists of the coconino sandstone. To summarize, the study found that the fossilized sand dunes only had a dip of a bout 20 degrees (agrees with [other geologist](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/624709) were as modern desert dunes only have a dip of roughly 32 degrees. Another problem with the coconino sandstone being the remnant of a desert is that the grains of the coconino sandstone are well rounded like those we find in modern day deserts. Specifically, from the 100 samples the scientist collected, they found that the most rounded sediments only had an rho value of  3.4. The coconino sandstone has only sub angular and sub rounded sediments, not well rounded which is a rho value of 5 or above. The sediments aren't well sorted either, in most cases, they're poorly to moderately sorted which would be expected if currents had deposited these sediments. Uniformitarian geologist assume that the coconino formed on top of dry cracked mud(hermit formation) and that the coconino desert came in afterward to deposit sand into these cracks. The problem is that if wind had deposited this sand, then the fillings should have horizontal layers in them. However, none were found and instead, the cracks had patterns you would only expect to see after a massive earthquake. These are interpreted as sand injectites which are fully consistent with the flood and not with uniformitarianism. Also, pock marks often interpreted as raindrops were found in rows, unlike modern raindrops in sand. The authors of the study were uncertain what the marks were, but they definatly weren't rain drops. The study also found that all the footprints were found up the dune slope. They also begin and end suddenly, unrelated to the animals direction of travel, something expected under flood conditions with animals frantically swimming and trying to escape the flood waters.

point 10: fossil tracks can't be formed during the flood

Yes they can through michael oards BEDS hypothesis that states that sediments would be exposed for a brief period of time due to natural variations in the sea level. Animals swimming upward would've been able to land on these briefly exposed diluvial sediments and could form the fossilized foot prints needed to account for these footprints.

point 10: the peluxy river formation, were creationist claim human foot prints exist, doesn't have any

Response: I would agree with this

Point 11: Creationist haven't shown how to classify baramin

Response: Here's [one](https://www.baraminology.net/biology/katagenos-species/) and [here's](https://www.baraminology.net/classification/natanzera-overview/)

point 12: The fossil should contain both extinct and modern species

Response: Well, for starters, it does and they're called [living fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_fossil). But we wouldn't expect that many living fossils in the first place because of the [founders effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect) which would cause all tetropod organisms to look wildly different then organisms in the fossil record, especially with all the migration and selection going on post flood that would make organisms look rapidly different.

point 13:  why would god allow a postflood extinction event to occur?

Response: the main point of the flood was to wipe out all of humanity and start anew, think of it like a global baptism. Human and other meat eating animals would've needed food to eat too, there was not just one singular purpose to bringing all the tetropods onto the ark. All of this was accomplished, making the flood exactly what god intended.

point 14: The flood could not produce seperated layers

Response: Yes it can, sediments tend to sort themselves out in water if they're mixed and given time to settle and stratify. You can look at [this](https://creation.com/experiments-on-stratification-of-heterogeneous-sand-mixtures) study by creationist scientist to see how stratification would've occurred during the flood.

point 15: The phrase, ""god blotted everything off the face of the earth"" implies that no aquatic species should be found in the fossil record

Response: That does not exclude aquative species, its just an inclusive statement referring to land animals.

point 16: God did not need a global flood to wipe out all humans 

Response: Humans, by that point, had corrupted all of creation with nephillim and all sorts of other abominations, God (similar to baptism) decided to flood the earth to signify a new creation from which he could get rid of the old. ",1519796722,4,2018-02-28 00:45:22

49,The Ultimate Prediction of Biblical Creationism,11,True,"Friends, be encouraged - it is no accident that the scientific revolution has its roots in the Christian worldview. We believe God not only created but sustains His universe, and that man, though fallen, was created in God’s image - only a worldview with these beliefs can support the assumptions made by science.

What are the assumptions made by science? That the universe has a natural order to it - a natural law - that is not only present but sustained (and therefore testable). That our minds are capable of rational thought. And that our senses are capable of accurately gathering empirical data about our universe. Each of these assumptions is rooted in the Christian worldview.

The materialist worldview cannot derive these assumptions. Descartes tried to assume only his existence (“I think therefore I am”) and it led to an ultimate conclusion that we cannot prove our senses can be trusted. Locke’s rationalism tried to assume only empirical evidence, which led to an ultimate conclusion that nothing can be known to be true, because empirical evidence could be found to invalidate all previous conclusions. Hume’s arguments from probability were meaningless for the same reason - probabilistic conclusions cannot be trusted as truth given that new evidence might be discovered. Thus the materialist has no basis upon which to assume the universe is orderly or comprehensible, that our minds are capable of reasoning accurately (if our brains are nothing more than chemical reactions), or that our senses are capable of accurately measuring empirical data.

By contrast, the Christian can assume God created a universe with a natural sustained order, and that God created man in His image with the ability to not only reason accurately about His creation, but to accurately measure empirical data with his senses. We can assume this because we have these truths revealed in God’s Word, which also tells us that, while we are fallen due to sin, and our reasoning and senses are therefore not always perfect, that truth does in fact exist, and that the universe is in fact comprehensible. “The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is its comprehensibility.” (Einstein)

It is no accident that Galileo, Copernicus, Bacon, Newton, Boyle, and Kepler all shared a Christian worldview. They believed the universe is comprehensible by virtue of it having been created by a loving God, and that we can, by experimentation, gain a knowledge of that which is true, because God created and sustains an orderly universe, and has created man in His image. The Christian can therefore assume that science is possible  - that man is capable of “thinking God’s thoughts after Him.” (Kepler)

The ultimate prediction of Biblical Creationism? That the scientific method can lead us to understand truths about the universe! Materialist scientists operate on capital borrowed from the Christian worldview, but it is running out - the more science advances our understanding of the complexity of life, the more science itself urges us towards our Creator.

56,"Dennis Venema, Ken Miller, NCSE, Susumu Ohno wrong about Nylonases",7,True,"[**advanced topic in Bio Informatics**]

Ohno claimed that a nylonase eventually called NylB was a unique enzyme that enabled bacteria to eat nylon.  John Sanford and I have falsified this claim on many levels.  

Ohno claimed NylB was unique and the result of a frame shift mutation.  First off I demonstrate in the video link below that NylB is not unique!

Next, Ohno's frame shift hypothesis is false because it is astronomically improbable a frame shift would create a protein that shares homology to 65,000 other proteins by random chance after 1935 (the invention of nylon).  Further, horizontal gene transfer is ruled out as an explanation for 65,000 copies of nylonases spread across thousands of bacteria in GenBank and other databases because the homologous NylB proteins  in other bacteria share as little as 20% sequence similarity.  The homology is mostly along predicted 3D structural lines. I give an informal description of how to find some (not all) of this data in the video.

Despite this, Venema uses Ohno's false claim as his favorite example  of how proteins can evolve from random mutations rather easily.  The NCSE also claims this proves ""Proteins can evolve without God's help.""  But like so many evolutionary ""evidences,""  Ohno's claim was purely speculative, with ZERO empirical experiments, and now in the present day, plenty of falsification in the way of psi-BLAST search for his predicted ancestral sequence which he called PR.C.

Unfortunately now, books promoting evolution by Ken Miller and Dennis Venema have been published and the public is being duped yet again.

58,"How significant is carbon-14 ""contamination""?",7,True,"I recently submitted a post to DebateEvolution asking for views on C-14 contamination. Since I got only a single creationist response I'll ask a similar question here to get a different point of view (I am NOT looking for debate, just to learn).

The question concerns the intrinsic C-14 which creationists often state has been detected in coal, diamonds and fossils which should be too old to contain any C-14. Most of the articles that they link me to, however, seem to believe this can be accounted for by factors such as N14 being bombarded by radiation, contamination by micro-organisms, and instrument background. And the key calculations (e.g. in section 7 of [this](http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Carbon-14-Evidence-for-a-Recent-Global-Flood-and-a-Young-Earth.pdf)) don't seem to be present in the peer-reviewed articles at all and are, unless I am mistaken, contradicted by empirical data (e.g. the variability of C-14 levels depending on the amount of radiation).

93,Questions about radiometric dating...,4,True,"I think I understand the basic idea behind radiometric dating.  My question concerns lab reports of tests using radiometric dating.  For instance, [in this article](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/radiometric-dating/radio-dating-in-rubble/) the results of a lab report are given for tests run on a 10 year old rock.  The results give actual ranges from 340,000 to 2.8 million years.

The rebuttal to this that I hear from old earth proponents is that these tests are not sensitive enough to measure ages below a certain range.  If this is the case, however, why do these reports give estimated ranges?  Can't the lab technicians see that the sample falls below the range they can detect?  If so, why doesn't the report read something like this: ""We are sorry but this sample is too young for us to give you an estimate; it could be anywhere from 10 years to 500,000"" (or whatever the lowest possible range is).  

Or consider this [from a recent post](https://creation.com/three-sisters-evidence-for-noahs-flood) by /u/Br56u7

""Long-age geologists wouldn’t bother analyzing for carbon-14 because they believe the rock is 230 million years old. All carbon-14 should have disappeared by 50,000 years, at the most. There should be no carbon-14 left. However, **the analysis confirmed a small but significant amount of carbon-14 in the wood**—clear evidence that the sandstone is less than 50,000 years old.""

Either the analysis can or cannot detect this material.  The report is said to *confirm* its presence, so my question is this:

Does some amount of carbon 14 show up in *everything* one could choose to analyze, or is it possible to test material for carbon 14 and get back the result ""this has 0 carbon 14"" or at least ""we can detect no carbon 14 in this sample""?  If so, then the detection of carbon 14, when it occurs, seems significant to me.

94,Liars for Darwin,7,True,"Sorry if this post comes off as antagonistic, but I'm  listing some of these common fallacies that a lot of evolutionist (on r/debateevolution or otherwise) use which are all incredibly dishonest and deserve to be called out. This is A bit blowing off some steam, but many if not most Darwinist I've ever debated use these fallacies and its the most frustrating thing ever, which is why I don't debate most Darwinist.


1. Imposing your truth as the objective truth and seeing it as so true, that anyone who disagrees must be a liar or dishonest. Not seeing how someone can disagree with you is just a bad habit and this is all rooted in an incredible argument from incredulity.""I can't possibly see how someone disagrees!""


2. Accusations of quote mining by suggesting that we're implying something we never suggested. In the confines of creationism/evolution, this goes along the lines of creationist going ""see, here look at this quote from this evolutionist/uniformitarian. He agrees and sees the same facts that we do yet concludes something different."" Then evolutionist,""QUOTE MINE! That person isn't a creationist at all and doesn't agree with you on this at all!"" Then creationist,""We never said he agreed with creationism, just that he saw the same facts as we do. We never implied what you think we implied."" This is almost always how this goes and evolutionist often ignore this (clear) fallacy and accuse YEC's of quote mining non stop which is dishonest. You end up rupturing and trying to block any trust that could exist between creationist and the general public, and this is a dishonest way of doing that. 


3. Equivocating being wrong with lying. The definition of lying is telling a falsehood you know or believe to be wrong to someone. Evolutionist do this all the time at debateevolution and this is dishonest. This is because your now putting it in peoples minds that we're somehow evil and attaching morality to something can obscure objective reasoning. When your taught ""this position is wrong"", That's one thing but then going around and saying ""this position is wrong and evil and so are the people advocating for it"" then no matter how good the logic that position may have, people will avoid it because they think its evil.


4. The adhoms and ridicule. This really doesn't need much explanation, but this is dishonest because it enforces a ""peer pressure"" mindset when it comes to such things. I've seen many Christians in Scandinavia or europe be worried about telling people their beliefs or even believing in christianity because everyone else doesn't and is mocked if they do. This same logic is applied to creationism and this _really_ obscures objective reasoning.


5. Not wanting to debate equals HAHA YOU LOST! No, if you constantly were getting pulled in to debates were the opponent threw adhoms and commited all the above fallacies, you would probably never would want to debate them again and you'd probably ignore them. Yet, I see users doing this all the time which Is why I have to mention this here. This is equivalent to someone throwing pigeon shit at you while playing checkers and then crying victory when you don't want to play checkers with them.
Edit:

6.gish galloping by derailing the argument from its original topic to discuss an entirely unrelated topic that they know takes a ton of time and effort and will result in long and complex debates that a creationist isn't necessarily trying to get into. The creationist is simply trying to stay on topic and the evolutionist is trying to distract. This results in the evolutionist accusing the creationist/ID of avoiding it because he ""knows"" that he doesn't have an argument. Ex.""UCM is not a fact because x.""""UCM is a fact because Y, but creationism is fiction and not fact and has no evidence for it"""" Y is wrong because of Z""""You know creationism has no evidence so you don't answer."" Don't get me wrong, if the topic warrants it, Ill gladly give evidence and talk about 6k mtEve, water gaps, escarpments, cratonic sequences, submarine canyons, bioturbation etc. But if we're talking about a relatively simple topic like IC, I'm not going off a tangent and discussing an unrelated topic. In specifically sticking to IC.

97,"Moon rock dating now suspect, Moon rock researcher calls radiomentric rock dating ""Quackery""",4,True,"Moon rocks were believed to be billions of years old.  That was the story after Apollo Astronauts brought back rock samples form the moon.  The billion year dates were very much believed and accepted until other NASA and other scientists like Mark Harrison said they can't be or aren't necessarily that old!

https://crev.info/2018/01/late-heavy-bombardment-myth-dying/

&gt;Others are still scrutinizing the original Apollo evidence. To determine the samples’ ages, researchers heated the rocks to release argon, slowly ramping up the temperature. But as far back as 1991, Harrison had pointed out that the process won’t work well for rocks containing multiple minerals. Different minerals will release their argon at different temperatures. A sample heated to 400 °C might provide an age of 2 billion years; to 500 °C, an age of 2.5 billion. Researchers have tried to extrapolate from this behaviour, but Harrison says the complex patterns often lead them to pick essentially arbitrary ages. **“This is quackery,” he says. “There’s no physical basis for it.”**

Get it, some radiometric dating is QUACKERY, not science.

That said, as a card carrying YLC/YEC, there are some good radio isotope arguments against YEC that need to be resolved to raise my comfort level in the YEC hypothesis, namely intermediate half-life isotopes, but that can only be resolved by more nuclear physics studies such as done in the Proton-21 lab.  There is a lot of science that still needs to be done.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/


&gt;JUNKYARD 747

&gt;Example: The odds of evolution having happened are the same as the odds that a tornado in a junkyard will assemble a Boeing 747.

&gt;Counter: Evolution is not an entirely random process, thanks to natural selection. The best variants are retained, so evolution doesn't start from scratch every time.

&gt;An analogy that explains natural selection's role in evolution would be: Take 10 dice and roll them until you get all of them to show a specific number -- let's say 6. The odds of this happening are infinitesimally small: 1 in 60,466,176.

&gt;Now, roll all the dice, but every time one of them reaches 6, keep it aside. Repeat until all show 6. Any given roll is now 1 in 6 to fix a die. To fix the 10 dice will take on average 60 total thrown dice total -- you'll be done in minutes.

&gt;Why It's Bad: It ignores one of the central pillars of Darwinian evolution: selection and genetic inheritance.


Actually most observed natural selection in the lab and field is destructive not constructive.  To extend that awful dice analogy the right way, selection would prevent getting 10 sixes in a row EVEN LESS than random chance.

Since macroevolution is dependent upon mutations that change the body plans of species, mutations that do so must impact development early in the process. However, these kinds of mutations are almost always deleterious"".""

An answer soon followed (the italics is mine):
&gt;""So, there is a question as to how mutation can ever select a better adapted individual. Since macroevolution is dependent upon mutations that change the body plans of species, mutations that do so must impact development early in the process. However, these kinds of mutations are almost always deleterious"".

&gt;I think he's implicitly assuming a one-step event here in which the body plan is radically reorganized by a single macromutation. Consider instead a series of small changes; each one is much less likely to disrupt anything.

&gt;But the greatest rebuttal of all is that *it clearly did happen: all metazoans are related by common descent, and the evidence for that is overwhelming*. Given that relationship, all the transformations implied by that tree must have happened somehow. One could of course claim that the process was helped along by some unnamed entity (hint: Jesus), but that doesn't appear to be Meyer's idea. He's all for independent creation, apparently. And the data just don't allow for that.

So, I am also sincerely trying to understand this problem, that's why I post and browse this sub. Although most scientists support evolution (the blind watchmaker version of it), Meyer seems to strike the very heart of the matter - this mechanism does not seem to have all the power Darwin (and his latter defendants) imagined, i.e., Micro and Macroevolution are still a chasm appart. And, if not that (or genetic drift or isolation, etc.), then what? How can people, like the one that replied be so sure that ""it clearly did happen""? 

In fact, it seems to me that in all these debates (like this one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yqqlZ29gcU, recently posted here) the question is not properly adressed. I may be biased, but it feels like Stephen Meyer et al. properly present the conundrum, but the other side is more concerned with ""dispelling"" the credibility of the ID proponents, in order to ensure the listeners that there is no real debate, that the science is settled. However, the doubt is real, even granted millions of years, the task seems intractable and the evidence to support this big claim is ntorhing short anedoctal - ""Finch beaks change in size and shape due to food shortage, or whatever; Haeckel's embryos depict a clear resemblance between mammals' embryos in their early stages (whoops, that's a fraud); the appendix is a vestigial organ (NOT AT ALL - check https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271818).

So again, what's not being said? What is this discussion really about? The theory of evolution gives all the appearance of an ideology, a rather proteiform one, I should say, but it is defended vigorously by top notch scients. At last the sincere question: why is that?",1517434819,7,2018-01-31 16:40:19

109,"Repetitive ""junkDNA"" acts as RAM, ""bad design"" turned out to be ingenious design",12,True,"For decades Darwinists have said repeating DNA in the human genome is obviously junk.  That's as silly as saying the identical copies of hundreds of computers in a server farm are junk merely because of repetition.  

The issue is that Darwinists have said DNA that repeats must be junk since this DNA repeats itself as copies and they were so sure they figured out how biology actually works.  The truth is they used evolutionary theory to argue something was non-functional, when in fact they actually didn't do lab experiments to confirm their speculations. Now that lab experiments are being done, they are showing themselves to be wrong (yet again).    This is especially bad for anti-ID evolutionary biologists like Ayala and Avise who made their case against ID because they said, ""a Intelligent Designer would make DNA repeat itself so many times.""

when he turns 5 we will then move on to discussing the beliefs of our immediate friends and family. Catholicism, wicca, as well as protestantism. This will involve going to services from each of these faiths, as well as speaking with family and their religious leaders.

At 8 we will begin formalizing his education. Epistemology will be the primary addition, as well as other religions like islam, judaism, and hinduism. 

From there his religious and philosophical education is for the most part up to him. We will encourage him to pursue what ever subject interests him.

119,"Darwinian Fitness is a Bogus Measure of Function, the back story of GoggleSaur's linked article",6,True,"[**advanced topic in evolutionary genetics**]

GoggleSaur alerted us to this article:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7tjo8n/dark_matter_dna_influences_brain_development/

And it didn't take me long to figure there is an interesting back story to this that shows how bogus scientifically the notion of Darwinian fitness is for defining function.  I implicitly predicted the sort of nonsense that would emerge some years back in articles I wrote where I highlighted the absurd fact that harmful mutations in the Darwinian world can be regarded as ""fit"":

https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/survival-of-the-sickest-why-we-need-disease/

https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/dennetts-strange-idea-is-a-bad-idea-for-recognizing-biological-function/

Darwinian fitness is defined by the number of offspring that live to reproduce.  So if blindness in cavefish help the cavefish make more babies, then ""it's not a bug[harmful mutation], it's a feature.""

Formally the formulas of fitness look like

wA = vA fA  

or

wA = (1/2) vA fA

where 

wA = absolute fitness

vA = viability (ability to live)

fA = fecundity, the number of babies it can make


The human race has grown from a population from under 10,000 to around 8 billion, it's ""fitness"" in the absolute sense has risen, but most geneticists will concede overall we are getting sicker.  So much for the utility of the evolutionary idea of ""fitness"" based on reproduction rates rather than fitness based on the idea of an engineered design.

There is a back story to GoggleSaur's article.  The article points to a study that likely points out a stretch of **NON-CODING** DNA called uc467 (just a catalog name, don't get hung up about names, a rose is a rose by any other name).

[The actual study:
http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)31497-6.pdf]

&gt; Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved enhancers were viable [**vA**] and fertile [**fA**] but **in nearly all cases showed neurological or growth abnormalities,** including substantial alterations of neuron populations and structural brain defects. 

So absolute reproductive ""fitness"" didn't change but the creatures were abby-normal.    

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inqdiNVzQcc

More evidence Darwinian ""fitness"" is bogus measure of function.

PS

Way back in 2007 when there was a push to say non-coding regions like uc467, this was the story:

&gt;http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/Genomics-ultraconserved.html

&gt;Detailed pathological examination of the reproductive organs and neuroanatomical examination of the brains of uc467 null mice revealed no apparent abnormalities (Table S1). In addition, the mice showed no obvious differences in the offspring expected from the hemizygous × heterozygous and hemizygous × homozygous crosses (Tables 3 and ​and44).

But if in the 2007 study these are the same non-coding regions in this 2018 study, we are getting a different story!  11 years later, the climate is much more friendly to saying ""non-coding DNA is functional"".  ",1517155874,11,2018-01-28 11:11:14
122,Functionality of Alu elements (x-post),0,True,"[**advanced topic in molecular biology**]

I challenged the resident professor of evolutionary biology at r/debateevolution  DarwinZDF42 to a debate over Alu elements which Darwinists have insisted is non-functional and thus evidence of bad design.

When I issued the challenge, this was his response:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7t7xct/problems_with_mutations_and_population_growth/dtcb1rp/

&gt;You're a vile, lying, ignorant pig of a creationist. You make the rest of the creationist community look good. So don't pretend for a second you give a shit about rational discourse and an honest exchange of ideas. 

Well anyway, this was my response to him on Alus (below):

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7thqys/functionality_of_alu_elements/

Darwinists have long claimed Alu elements in the human genome are evidence of bad design because Darwinists ""know"" they are non-functional.  I don't think we know that for sure.  But first what is an Alu element:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alu_element

&gt;The Alu family is a family of repetitive elements in the human genome. Modern Alu elements are about 300 base pairs long and are therefore classified as short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) among the class of repetitive DNA elements....
There are over one million Alu elements interspersed throughout the human genome, and it is estimated that about 10.7% of the human genome consists of Alu sequences. 

The rest of the wiki article was chock full of evolutionary speculation, not actual data.  But as recently as 2010, this was the Darwinist view of Alu's:


http://biologos.org/blogs/archive/on-reading-the-cells-signature/


&gt;The human genome includes about twenty-five thousand genes and lots of other (mostly short) switch sequences, which turn on and off genes in different tissues and at different times and play other functional roles. There are also lots and lots of DNA sequences that are nonsensical. For example, there are about one million virtually identical Alu sequences that are each three-hundred letters (nucleotides) long and are spread throughout the human genome. Think about it: there are in the human genome about twenty-five thousand genes, but one million interspersed Alu sequences; forty times more Alu sequences than genes. It is as if the editor of Signature of the Cell would have inserted between every two pages of Meyer’s book, forty additional pages, each containing the same three hundred letters. Likely, Meyer would not think of his editor as being “intelligent.” Would a function ever be found for these one million nearly identical Alu sequences? It seems most unlikely. In fact, we know how these sequences come about: one new Alu sequence appears in the genome for every ten newborns, generation after generation. The Designer at work? Unlikely: many of these sequences damage the genome causing abortion of the fetus during the early weeks of life.

&gt;Perhaps one could attribute the obnoxious presence of the Alu sequences to degenerative biological processes that are not the result of ID. But was the Designer incompetent or malevolent in not avoiding the eventuality of this degeneration? Come to think of it: why is it that most species become extinct? More than two million species of organisms now live on Earth. But the fossil record shows that more than ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived became extinct. That is more than one billion extinct species. How come? Is this dreadful waste an outcome intended by the Designer? Or is extinction an outcome of degeneration of genetic information and biological processes? If so, was the Designer not intelligent enough or benevolent enough to avoid the enormity of this waste?

Turns out Ayala's understanding is obsolete.  Yet another POSSIBLE failed argument of evolutionism.  Why? A recently published basic biochemistry text:

&gt;From Lehninger Principels of Biochemistry sixth edition (as in like the last few years):


&gt;The ADAR-promoted A-to-I editing is particularly common in transcripts derived from the genes of primates. Perhaps 90% or more of the editing occurs in Alu elements, a subset of the eukaryotic transposons called short interspersed elements (SINEs), that are particularly common in mammalian genomes. There are over a million of the 300 bp Alu elements in human DNA, making up about 10% of the genome. These are concentrated near protein-encoding genes, often appearing in introns and untranslated regions at the 3' and 5' ends of transcripts. When it is first synthesized (prior to processing), the average human mRNA includes 10 to 20 Alu elements. The ADAR enzymes bind to and promote A-to-I editing only in duplex regions of RNA. The abundant Alu elements offer many opportunities for intramolecular base pairing within the transcripts, providing the duplex targets required by the ADARs. Some of the editing affects the coding sequences of genes. Defects in ADAR function have been associated with a variety of human neurological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy, and major depression.

&gt;The genomes of all vertebrates are replete with SINEs, but many different types of SINES are present in most of these organisms. The Alu elements predominate only in the primates. Careful screening of genes and transcripts indicates that A-to-I editing is 30 to 40 times more prevalent in humans than in mice, largely due to the presence of many Alu elements. Large-scale A-to-I editing and an increased level of alternative splicing (see Fig. 26–21) are two features that set primate genomes apart from those of other mammals. It is not yet clear whether these reactions are incidental or whether they played key roles in the evolution of primates and, ultimately, humans.

So, should evolutionists do their usual stunt and rush to judgement and say something is junk, or should we wait and learn more.  

Are Alu's definitely non-functional?  We don't know, but I've shown it's premature to say so.  The resident professor of evolutionary biology DarwinZD42 insists he knows Alus are non-functional.  How can he possibly know that?  Shouldn't he be teaching students from basic textbooks like the one I just cited?  That's what I'll teach my students any way.

&gt;This is just a friendly survey question, not any right or wrong answer for the sake of argument, just soliciting your opinion for a book I'm writing....

&gt;There is the noticeable nested hierarchy that appears both in molecular and morphological comparisons. For example, I constructed this phylogentic diagram on the COX1 mitochondrial protein using MEGA 6.0 software. It recaptures the morphological hierarchy of Linnaeus:

&gt;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nj_differnces_circled2-111-1.png

&gt;Fwiw this is the protein in question: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase_subunit_I

&gt;Now are the similarities the result of common descent or common design. It seems to me, if some creature (like a fish) can't evolve into another creature (like a bird), then the patterns of similarity and diversity that for the twin nested hierarchies is the result of common design through likely an act of miraculous special creation. 

&gt;Alternatively, one could invoke the Faint Young Sun Paradox and other problems with the fossil record to show there wasn't enough time for evolution.

&gt;But all that aside, the bottom line question: ""is there any argument against the probability of evolution (Universal Common Ancestry) that would make you think creation is a possibility?""

&gt;If ""yes"" describe it. If you say ""no"", I respect that, but I'm soliciting whether in fact that is your position -- that perhaps nothing short of God showing up in front of you, working miracles and telling you point blank ""evolution is wrong"". If that is your position, I respect that in as much as everyone has their threshold of what would make a believer out them.

133,Evo-illusionist webpages by Stephen T. Blume,4,True,"I just found these this week.  He has many good points and his writing style is so acerbic and sarcastic, cutting at the foolish assumptions of evolution, that it's really funny and enjoyable.

Sadly, the webpage looks awful - like from the 80s.

_From https://evoillusion.org/abiogenesis-made-difficult/ something that I never thought of before_

&gt; Another problem for ev-abiogenesis is the fact that as a pre-cell came closer and closer to the ability to sustain life, it would be non-living or dead tissue. Dead tissue constantly deteriorates. The minute an organism of any kind dies, breakdown begins. Cells that are studied by students and pathologists must be “fixed” to prevent that deterioration. [...]  Cells that die by necrosis may release harmful chemicals that damage other cells. Pre-biotic cells that are supposedly evolving into living cells would constantly be fighting the fact that they are necrotic.

_From https://evoillusion.org/impossiblities-of-evolution/ more delightful sarcasm about bird nests_

&gt;And what scenario could there possibly be for arboreal “branch” bird nests to evolve? Or really any bird nest? Bird nests are beyond fascinating.  They are feats of engineering beyond our own ability to construct.  **Try it yourself.  See if you can weave those tiny twigs and straw into anything that looks nest-like; with your hands.  You will fail quickly.  Now try it  with your teeth.  Remember, birds weave their incredible artistry with their beaks! They have no fingers to help them along.**  There are an immense number of incredible designs for bird nests. Evo-illusionists say birds first made nests in tree-holes.  Then the tree-hole nesting birds gradually move out to the branches.  But if you compare the two pictures above, you will quickly see the differences in engineering required for both. Try to imagine the branch nest evolving from the tree hole nest.  What adventurist bird had the “guts” to try moving its nest out to those thin branches, then laying eggs on the first prototype nest? Was that first prototype a few twigs with eggs? Did the eggs splat? Did the twigs fall?  Were those first courageous inventive birds observed by other birds who tried to copy the nest building of the first few birds that gave branch nest building a try? If the eggs fell, why would an intelligent bird capable of thinking and copying, if there was such a bird, try to copy the first birds?  Did a bird that saw the first few failures think it could make a better branch nest? Do birds think to that degree?  Maybe millions of years ago there were highly intelligent “Sir Isaac Newton” birds that were thinkers.  Actually, any scenario is ridiculous.

And from https://evoillusion.org/thinking-about-organ-ev-and-a-blind-watchmaker/  he destroys Richard Dawkins (which many people have done already).

&gt; Dawkins discusses flight (p, 89):

&gt; Dawkins states that many animals that existed before **birds** were able to leap from tree to tree, like a lot of animals today. Some could jump farther distallyances than others, and would not fall from heights that would cause them death. Others could not, and they would eventually fall and be killed. Survival of the fittest would be in action here. The best jumpers would out-survive the worst. Plus, the best jumpers may have had skin between their body and legs or aerodynamic bodies that could enhance their flight. Dawkins labels the height at which a leaping animal would just survive h, which makes this discussion seem real scientific, as if he is going to make some mathematical formula. (He doesn’t.) Eventually the animals might find that “flapping” would enhance their flying, and they would begin growing wings and feathers. The final result would be the incredibly aerodynamic wings of modern birds. Of course the question arises: why aren’t the short jumping animals of today falling and dying, and the good jumpers evolving wings that yield flight? There are currently a huge number of species that make tree to tree jumps. I bet Dawkins would say they are “modern” animals, and evolution stopped for them. The most preposterous thing about this scenario is the idea that the animals could spring wings; incredibly aerodynamic wings at that, plus feathers, and brains that are capable of flapping the wings in such a perfect way which yields the unimaginable flight that we see in birds today. And, of course, as with all of evolution, where are the fossils that back up Dawkins? Where are the growing wings? Non existent. Actually one could cite chickens and ostriches, as they have remnant wings. Since evolutionists cite “simple” eyes, why not these flightless small winged birds to demonstrate flight evolution?

&gt; Dawkins thinks that there were 100,000 to 250,000 mutations that evolved **eyes.** Since eyes have about 30 parts, just how did the 100,000 to 250,000 mutations divvy up amongst the 30 parts? Did 10,000 make the retina? Did 3,450 make the iris? Of course the mutations would have to work as a team, later mutations completing the job the that earlier ones started. Later “iris mutations” would have to add to earlier “iris mutations”, for example. Just imagine the accounting system that would be required for eye evolution.  Dawkins calls the eyeball an evolutionary “target”, but one that is not chosen ahead of time. Of course targets always require an intelligent chooser, whether it be darts, a gun, a cannon, or an eye system. Targets require intelligence. If a person was to throw darts in a bar without picking a target, he would have some pretty unhappy bar patrons who would probably kick him out. For Dawkins to discuss targets is an admission of intelligence, which he does not even realize.

&gt; Using the four chambered **heart** as an example: the heart is made up of twenty or so major parts. According to Dawkins, these evolved in 100,000 micro-steps. How do we divvy up the steps and relate them to the parts? Did the ventricle evolve with one mutational step, or did many coordinated mutations form the ventricle? Is it imaginable that three hundred mutations could form the coronary arteries? Or the valve cusps? What about cardiac muscle cells and their attached nerve cells; did one mutation create all of the cells, or did a huge number of coordinated mutations form a million or so with each step. Try the same mental experiment with the kidney, ear, lung, etc. It’s easy to verbalize how species and organs formed through evolutionary micro-steps. But when you really get down to visualizing how it happened through mind experiments, evolution quickly becomes not even a “maybe”, but impossible.",1516754592,13,2018-01-23 19:43:12

142,How mythology disproves the flood [Debunked],5,True,"Here, Aron Ra has an edgy title to conclude his 8 video series on the flood. I'm going to debunk it like the other 2 I already have and I'll hopefully get around to debunking all 8 of aron ra's flood videos.
(lol, he equates america's downfall with belief in the global flood.)
(goes on to be appalled at how big creationist are and mocks several institutions for it. Bonus, he threw discovery institute in there.)

point 1) Essentially starts listing a bunch of flood myths from talk origins and trys to show how different they are. When debating this, on both sides, I find it incredulous when people start nitpicking myths that support their own paradigm with out providing some sort of study, or survey of myths to support their side. So to provide a study of them, [ICR](http://www.icr.org/article/why-does-nearly-every-culture-have-tradition-globa/) did one for about 200 myths around the world and compared them to one another. I don't use this argument often because there haven't been that many comparison studies of flood myths. and the ones that exist don't account for the fact that the more recent the flood myth and the less writing the people had, the more it's likely to differ from the noah's flood account. But either way, you can't nitpick flood stories to support your position, so aron ra's argument is pretty much nonsensical.

point 2) The fact that God doesn't just do everything for noah magically or recreate all the animals like in other stories, indicates that he's false. This is ridiculous reasoning is basically the same as arguing ""who's superhero's better."" God frequently gives humans impossible tasks in the bible to show his glory through people like in david and goliath. Sure, god could've just zapped goliath, but he wanted to show his glory through david, so he had him sling shot a rock to kill goliath. So in noah's ark, god gave noah the 'impossible' task of building an ark to save life on earth, which he did. It's a pattern we see throughout the bible and even among christians today, so we would expect to see with noah. But either way, this subjective argument over who's the better god is pretty nonsensical and to top it off, he presents it in a mocking tone as if it's a good argument. (the fact that most of these myths only contain 2 people surviving is a similarity you wouldn't expect with local floods, as several groups of people would've survived.)

point 3) The bible indicates a flat dome earth at creation week. No, and I already addressed this point in [my rebuttal to aron ra's first video](https://redd.it/7laujc) so I don't particularly feel the need to address it right here.

point 4) noahs ark was derived from gilgamesh. Sure, we find a lot of similarities between the flood and other near eastern account, but there's no conclusive proof that the biblical account came from gilgamesh. We would expect other accounts from the near east to be similiar to noah's flood because they aren't to far from babel, which is were all of these stories would've derived from noah. The influence from noah's flood would be great in this region and it would follow that the stories would be very similiar.

point 5) noah's ark, gilgamesh and other near eastern flood stories are based off a local flood that happened in 2900BC.  This is begging the question, as you already have to assume noah's flood was not global (which the text clearly indicates) to assume it was based off of a local flood, to assume its false. There probably was a local flood in the near east some time after noah's flood and the ice age, but assuming that genesis is talking about that or any of these stories require that you a priori reject the flood. This is the same reasoning implored with point number 4.

point 6) The babel story was based off an event in ancient babylon involving loss of money which caused the city to stop being able to build the tower and to stop being able to educate their children into reading cuneiform. Not only does this assume the conclusion in the premise, the global flood didn't happen so babel was false so the bible's talking about this so babel is false, this doesn't explain why the story talks about a mass migration from babel or the splitting off of groups into different nations after that. aron ra doesn't provide evidence that this story has migration included in it so I have to conclude that this event simply can't account for the genesis story of babel.",1516414220,21,2018-01-19 21:10:20
143,Out of place amber fossil appears 170 million years earlier than it should,3,True,"Before the wiki thought police erase facts contrary to evolutionism here is a little blurb:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber#Geological_record
&gt;**The oldest amber recovered dates to the Upper Carboniferous period (320 million years ago).[2][36]** Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers – **it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants; however, there are no flowering plant fossils until the Cretaceous, and they were not common until the Upper Cretaceous. Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the Early Cretaceous, 150 million years ago,[2]** when it is found in association with insects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OOPS!


So how do evolutionists resolve the problem?  The appeal to hypothetical plants that made the amber.  These missing-link hypothetical plants have never been confirmed in the fossil record and mysteriously left no traces.  When all else fails appeal to mechanism that are unseen and untestable.


Like I often say, evolutionists are no different than creationists in as much as they appeal to unseen miracles to fix their theory.

146,"Index Fossils used to date ""eras"" are mostly sea shells -- this is a problem",6,True,"So we have plants and animals, like birds and land plants in the fossil record. How do we date these fossils?  Well, if we used C14 or racemization dating, we would get young dates.  So well, that's disregarded.  So what do evolutionists use?  Sea shells.  From the US Geological Survey of the US Government, here is a list of index fossils:

https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/fossils.gif

So how is it that a bird fossil is buried with these sea shells?  Worse, how about if the bird fossil is buried below sea shells?

This problem didn't go un-noticed by a creationist who is a practicing geologist in the secular world:

http://www.icr.org/article/8769

Today’s coelocanths live about 500 feet below the ocean surface and not in freshwater rivers as many paleontologists have proposed. They dismiss the blatant physiological evidence from living specimens and insist that ancient coelocanths must have lived in fresh water simply because they are found in strata with dinosaurs.

149,How Zoology Disproves Noah's Flood by aron ra [Debunked],0,True,"I previously debunked aron ra's first video, in his 8 video series on the flood, called ""How meteorology debunks the flood."" The next video I watched, and the other one I wanted to debunk, was ""how zoology disproves the flood.

point 1) There are some species of animals that live exclusively on islands and couldn't migrate their after the flood. Ra already knows about kinds and I'm going to apply the concept here. The species that he names, like the galapagos tortoise, are all part of bigger genus's or families that are spread over larger regions. The genus of the aforementioned animal is spread across south america, and it's family (from what I could gather) spread accross the globe. The explanation for their migration is that the post flood ice age would've provided lower sea levels and allowed land bridges for these animals to migrate to these specified locations. Another one is log mats that would've allowed animals to float to these locations. The second explanation may sound crazy until you realize that uniformitarian biologist have the [same](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160126-the-monkeys-that-sailed-across-the-atlantic-to-south-america) explanation for monkeys migrating to south america and for other animals. Uniformitarian scientists have the same problem with the [same explanations](https://creationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/crsq-2012-volume-48-number-3.pdf) (pg.21) too.


point 2) How do you deal with sea turtles and walruses that can't last for a year on a boat or in the sea. For sea turtles, they simply could've swam up to sea level with the flood waters and caught some air before having to go back into the ocean. Even throwing out the above explanation, sea turtles in their early youth spend most of their time on seaweed mats so the adults could've died and their offspring could've lasted 10 months on seaweed. plus, sea turtles preflood would've been adapted to environments that weren't on the continental shelf (due to their probable lack of existence) and probably would've been able to survive underwater for a much longer time too. walruses could've stayed near the surface too and gotten air too. Another thing to note is that the walrus is in the genus odobenus, the only surviving one in the family odobenidae. So previous ancestors of walruses may have been better adapted to oceanic life not on a continental shelf, but later the genus was selected because it was better adapted to shelf life and thus, developed to lose the ability to hold it's breath for long underwater.


point 3)How do you feed carnivores? Well, it seem like the tetropods noah would've brought on had just descended into carnivore. This could mean that a general transition from herbivore to carnivore would've required an omnivore middle phase, meaning that while some animals on the ark did eat meat all of them could eat plants and survive on that for 10 months.


point 4) How did noah feed the animals? Noah, having the intelligence and engineering skills to build the ark, could've been able feed him in a lot of ways.Some animals could've and probably did hibernate to relax the load. Noah probably stored up grain, hay and other food for the time he was building the ark. He probably designed a self feeder of some sort. as for water, he could've  probably built a rainwater-pipe system for the animals to drink.


point 5) Lice, parasites, ticks etc. would've caused problems for the animals on board the ark. None of these would've been carried on the ark. If we're supposing that god guided all of these animals to noah, than it can be assumed that he brought the best specimen of each kind with the best genes and the best ability to survive and migrate post flood. Thus, ""supernatural selection"" would've come to play and eliminated all risk of this.


point6) Insects couldn't survive outside of the ark. This is sort of debateable among creationist. If they were on the ark, then they wouldn't take up that much space. Estimates put the amount of combined insect and arachnid species at 1 million. to give 2m bugs a 5cm^3  room, would require about 250 million cubic centimeters, which sounds big but is only .6% of the arks total volume. If they weren't on the ark then they all could've survived on massive floating debris.


point7) dinosaurs couldn't make it on the ark. For someone who's been debating creationism as long as aron ra has, you'd think he'd know the answer to this. So to repeat, smaller versions of dinasaurs within the same kind ( like the cousins of the t-rex in the family Tyrannosauridae) or younger offsprings would've gone on to the ark. 
point 8) dinasaurs are not leviathan/behemoth. I don't really care for debating this so if any of you guys want to take this head on, go to [5:02 in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0J5WMmykEs&amp;list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMJP95iZJqEjmc5oxY5r6BzP&amp;index=5). (Bonus, he accuses YEC's of lying just for believing that leviathan/behemoth means dinasuar. hilarious)


point 9) living things now only include 1% of all things that ever lived and it couldn't be possible that all species live together at one time. He doesn't cite a source on this, nor do I now if it's just 1% of all living _species_ today, or just all animals living today compared to the predicted amount that would've lived in the past. I'm also getting the general feeling that uniformitarian explanations would biasely effect that estimate if he's talking about the second one. This also doesn't account for animal distriution or size or environmental needs, most fossils in the fossil record are from aquatic species. We don't have a good idea of all the species that exist right now in the ocean, only 5% of it has ever been mapped. I have no idea what the average fossil size is nor how much food they would've had to have eaten.  Aron ra's making vast simplifications of the fossil record without even a _source_ for this.


point 10) What about all the tetropods that should've been on the ark but are now extinct. [post flood extinction event](https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/what-happened-to-animals-after-noahs-ark/), many wouldn't have left a trace as there wouldn't be many carcasses to fossilize. 


point 11) CHECKMATE CREATARDS! AIG COULDN'T BUILD A ZOO IN THE ENCOUNTER! No but seriously, I had to be a bit facetious with this claim. Answers in genesis is trying to have space for thousands of people, concessions stands, shows an what not. Modern appliances would take up much more space and they needed adequate space for people to move around. they also have to deal with the smell and the methane, which might be bearable for 8 people who know it's either that or die. but for people _paying_ _money_, that's just not ideal. Another bonus is that he presumes that they  chose to leave out dinasaurs with bird wings and calls them liars for it, as if this was actually a known executive decision (it isn't) and as if many of them [believe that dinosaurs even had wings](https://creation.com/flying-dinosaurs-flightless-dinosaurs-and-other-evolutionary-fantasies) and tried to cover it up.
(goes on to paint baramins as a copout)


point 12) cats couldn't have divesified within a kind at around 2400 bc because we already had cave art depictions of them. Now we're shifting the conversation to dating methods and the age of the earth. We kind start talking about radiometric dating methods, as the cave art is dated with c-14 which depends on our knowledge of the primordial atmosphere. see [here](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/radiometric-dating/not-infallible/) for more details on radiometric dating and see [here](https://creation.com/age-of-the-earth) for evidence against old earth.


point 13) the fact that interediates between kinds exist disproves the whole notion. No and this is best accounted for by common design as common descent has some difficult gene flow [problems](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life/).
 

point 14) The fact that a post flood extinction event even happened is evidence that the ark was a failure. No, the purpose for the flood was to punish humans for the wickedness of their antidiluvian selves and he did just that. He wanted to start a new world, analagous to how baptism represents rebirth and renewal, and he did just that. You could argue  that the post flood extinction did just that, provide a new biosphere incredibly different from the old one. 
( he keeps talking about creationism as if it's just all coming out of answer in genesis)

point 15) The bible never defines what a kind is. It sort of does, with it saying saying that all organisms are to reproduce after their kind. This follows that kind is a group of animals with a common group of ancestors who were interfertile at creation week. Also, aron ra keeps insinuating that kind is a new concept to cop out of the fact that speciation is observable. This is just false, the word baramin's been around since 1941 after being coined by frank marsh and the concept's been around for older.


Point 16) phylogeny proves universal common ancestry right.[wrong](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life/).""everything about phylogenetics is an inconveniant truth for creationist avoiding the truth. lol.


point 17) Genetic bottlenecks would be so severe that no animal would survive.  Well, again, the post flood extinctinction event proves that most animals _didn't_ survive this flood. But for the animals that survived, it's likely that they had a better ability to derive allelic diversity from just a small group of just 2 ancestors. We have evidence of this from mtEve and Y-Adam, and their dates using empirical mutation rates to get roughly 6k years.


point 18) Ken ham arbitrarily defines baraminology by saying that he considers it mostly at the species level but sometimes moves it up to the family level. For someone who fanatically accuses creationist of quote mining, I'm stunned by the hypocrisy in this video. No, he and most other creationist say that it's mostly at the family/genus level with _some_ being at species. And it's not arbitrary, it's based on interfertility. This is just _stunning_ from someone who constantly accuses creationist of lying, decieving and quote mining.


point 19) if the concept of baramins were true, we should see a point were in the phylogenetic tree distinctly unique from all other animals around it and supposedly ancestral to it. Wrong, that's cause phylogeny is built from morphological and genetic similarity, a process that could be accounted for by common design. however we [do see](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life/) inconsistency in gene flow when trying to make a phylogenetic tree, an exact prediction of baraminology and creationism",1516340115,4,2018-01-19 00:35:15

We can test design by trying to reverse engineer biological structures to determine if there is an ""irreducible core."" Intelligent design also makes other predictions, such as

 2) rapid appearance of complexity in the fossil record,(unless your ID and YEC, then this is a prediction for the flood)

 3) re-usage of similar parts in different systems (i.e., different types of organisms), 
(Seperated itself from evolution in that genes that contradict a single phylogenetic tree don't get explained away with HGT or convergent evolution.)

4) function for biological structures. Each of these predictions may be tested--and have been confirmed through testing!( I take this as meaning that most of the genome should be functional)

Is there anymore to add or is this it? I find it incredulous that evolutionist claim that creationism makes nonpredictions (or that ID=YEC) but this claim taken against ID is a bit harder to refute because ID claims to only rain a lot less. ",1515780707,58,2018-01-12 13:11:47

187,New Year's Cage Match: Sanford vs. Dawkins,5,True,"Ok, so it’s only a metaphorical cage fight; nevertheless, Dawkins should be tapping out frantically.


I got Dr. Sanford’s *Genetic Entropy &amp; the Mystery of the Genome* for Christmas.  It is a fascinating read so far and very eye-opening.  I plan to make a few posts about it as I go through it.  This is the first.


It concerns an analogy which I think captures the proposal of evolution better than any other I am aware of.


Sanford asks us to imagine a little red wagon with an instruction manual for how to build it.  The wagon is the first primitive form of life; the instruction manual is its genome.  He then asks us to imagine that this instruction manual is copied to provide instructions for the building of the next generation of little red wagons.  Obviously, mistakes will occur in the copying of the manual, but each successive “generation” of instruction manuals will be selected based on the performance of the wagons of the previous generation, so the more significant errors in the manuals will be eliminated.  He then asks us to judge whether it is reasonable to believe that this process, which might on some occasions make a circumstantially better wagon, would ever lead to a starship (i.e., a human genome).  Clearly it would be absurd to think that it would.


And, by analogy, it is equally absurd to think that we could have evolved from something as different and simple as bacteria.  One excellent feature of his analogy is that it vividly illustrates the fact that the changes proposed by evolutionary theory are ultimately changes in kind, not degree.  Evolutionists often point to the tiniest circumstantial benefits of a mutation (i.e., maybe the handle of the wagon is mistakenly made one inch longer in one generation) and ask us to believe that the difference between this and the development of warp drive is simply one of degree.   


Now compare Sanford’s analogy with Richard Dawkins’s [Methinks It Is Like a Weasel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkSkXbqcCgU&amp;t=263s) (at around 4:00) analogy.  Of course, all analogies are limited in their applicability, but within those limitations, some are good and some are bad in varying degrees.  Sanford’s is very good.  Dawkins’s is very bad.  Here is why.



**1) It makes the outcome not only probable, but inevitable.** 

Dawkins, in his zeal to convince us of the plausibility of evolution grossly misrepresents natural selection with his analogy.  And I am genuinely mystified by how many people are misled by this analogy.  When confronted with the [monstrous improbability of evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c) (at around 1:20), its supporters usually mock such objections with terms like “big scary numbers” (as if this answers the objection) and present a scenario which exactly copies Dawkins’s error.  By contrast, while Sanford’s analogy does not ignore natural selection, it puts the process into proper perspective. 


**2) In Dawkins’s analogy, selection is targeted for the sentence, “Methinks it is like a weasel.”**
 
Evolution is not targeted for specific future goals.  In anticipation of criticism along these lines, Dawkins even admits that his analogy “is a bit of a cheat.”  Indeed it is.  On the other hand, once again, Sanford’s analogy accurately represents the evolutionary process: There is no selection for starships, only for the best wagons.


**3) Dawkins's program requires generation after generation of dysfunctional organisms to survive and replicate.**
 
The Weasel program selects genomes based on individual mutations, not based on the overall fitness of the organism.  Evolution selects based on overall fitness. Here once more, Sanford succeeds admirably where Dawkins fails.  In Sanford’s analogy, whole wagons are selected based on their overall fitness as wagons.


I could find no way that Dawkins’s analogy is better than Sanford’s.  In the interest of charity, however, I tried to find a way that it is at least useful in some regard.  I suppose his program for selecting random numbers to simulate mutations could be a useful parallel to reality.  I won’t bother pointing out how ironic it is that the program is itself the product of intelligent design.

189,Human's gene introns closer to the plant Arabidopsis Thaliana than to gene introns of the animals like fruitflies and nematodes,11,True,"[**Advanced Topic in Molecular Biology, but something a beginner can learn quickly**]

I'm going to be creating videos to teach molecular biology and biochemistry for creationists.  The jargon may sound intimidating, but it's a lot easier than you might think.

For those without a lot of biology background, I recommend watching the following  2-minute video on the processing of a gene in a eukaryote (like a human) before it gets translated to a protein:

https://www.dnalc.org/resources/3d/rna-splicing.html

That 2-minute video on spliceosomal introns teaches more solid science than the months of life I wasted studying evolutionary theory.  When I confront Darwinists with the question of how this system evolved, they respond with what sounds to me like the mumbo jumbo of ""phylogenetic methods"" which aren't mechanistic explanations found in real disciplines like chemistry and physics, but rather hand-waved circularly reasoned non-sequitur obfuscations.  


Additionally refer to this diagram of a gene:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron#/media/File:Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA.svg

The diagram is a bit off since the introns are 10 to 15 time bigger than the exons on average in a human!

This  is implied by the fact about 30% of human DNA is introns, and only about 2-3% is exons, so in humans the length of the introns can be 10-15 times longer than exons on average.

I could stop right here and just argue with Darwinists for hours about how the spliceosomal intron system evolved, but there are some other problems.

The introns of humans are more similar to the plant Arabidopsis Thaliana than they are to animals like frutiflies and nematodes.   This is a strange pattern if one accepts common descent.  The authors of a paper that discovered this anomaly suggest some solutions to this perplexing pattern, but it makes the assumption of common descent a little harder to explain, whereas similarities created by God might seem more reasonable.

If one creature can't evolve to another, like say a plant to animal, or vice-versa, or evolve from a common ancestor (like what would the ancestor of a human and a blade of grass look like), then the similarities we share with a plant like Arabidopsis vs. an animal like a fruitfly or nematode worm  are not due to common descent but common design by the creator.

Anyway, here is the paper in question:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12956953

&gt;Paradoxically, humans share many more introns with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana than with the fly or nematode.

AIG thought I was talking about the fossil order, ICR just explained continental drift and gave me links to articles that didn't answer my question and CMI, I think you'd have to break down this response.

Their response was

""We need to understand that the Flood was an enormous catastrophe that occurred on Earth. It seems that it was characterised by an ongoing series of convulsions (tectonic movements) in the earth’s crust as the crust moved from its Pre-Flood configuration through a series of intermediate stages to its final post-Flood configuration. It can be illustrated by the repeated dropping movement of a ball rolling down a flight of stairs—sudden drop, rolling pause, sudden drop, rolling pause, ….  The Lake Missoula flood illustrates just one tiny aspect of a much larger and longer sequence of events.

 Each crustal convulsion, which mainstream geologists call an orogeny (or mountain building episode), did the following. It folded, faulted, sheared, pushed, buried, uplifted, and metamorphosed the rocks. At the same time it melted some of the rocks to produce magma, which was squeezed through faults and fissures, pooled in huge underground plutons, and erupted on the surface. Further, the convulsion swept the floodwaters across the earth’s surface eroding the rocks, transporting, grinding, and sorting the eroded material, and depositing it in sedimentary basins.""

I've also been getting confused between this argument and another argument that /u/johnberea (joe coder) made in some posts long ago that says mutations produce new information too slowly to account for the amount of information we see and observe today. I'm confused over whether /u/johnberea's argument is just an argument of time similar to haldanes dilemma or whether his argument is exactly the same as mine in that they don't outnumber information decreasing mutations. He frequently uses malaria and its resistance to antibodies as a demonstration for his argument.

I'm also confused between an argument I've seen him frequently make on Reddit and on his blog notascientist that uses the rescent discoveries of ENCODE to disprove evolution.Basically, its that evolution has to generate genomes were over 90%-95% of the genome is junk DNA or else mass extinction happens. I'm wondering why this is the case that evolution has to do this and how does encode disprove evolution ( as I've heard encode uses confusing definitions of functional.) I've also heard similar arguments involving gene flows that I'm confused about too.

Are all of these seperate arguments that I'm confusing or are they the same but just using different terminology to explain them?

199,Creationists Bill Basener and John Sanford publish in the Journal of Mathematical Biology,13,True,"[**advanced topic in mathematical Genetics**]

https://crev.info/2017/12/geneticist-corrects-fishers-theorem/


&gt;A recent paper in the Journal of Mathematical Biology  (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x) has uncovered major problems with the historically pivotal Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. That theorem was proven by Ronald Fisher – one the great scientists of the last century. Fisher’s theorem was published in 1930, and was the foundational work that gave rise to neo-Darwinian theory and the field of population genetics.


&gt;Fisher’s theorem was … the foundational work that gave rise to neo-Darwinian theory and the field of population genetics.

&gt;Fisher described his theorem as “fundamental,” because he believed he had discovered a mathematical proof for Darwinian evolution. He described his theorem as equivalent to a universal natural law – on the same level as the second law of thermodynamics.  Fisher’s self-proclaimed new law of nature was that populations will always increase in fitness – without limit, as long as there is any genetic variation in the population. Therefore evolution is like gravity – a simple mathematical certainly. Over the years, a vast number of students of biology have been taught this mantra – Fisher’s Theorem proves that evolution is a mathematical certainty.

&gt;The authors of the new paper describe the fundamental problems with Fisher’s theorem. They then use Fisher’s first principles, and reformulate and correct the theorem. They have named the corrected theorem The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection with Mutations. The correction of the theorem is not a trivial change – it literally flips the theorem on its head. The resulting conclusions are clearly in direct opposition to what Fisher had originally intended to prove.

&gt;In the early 1900s, Darwinian theory was in trouble scientifically. Darwin’s writings were primarily conceptual in nature, containing a great deal of philosophy and a great deal of speculation. Beyond simple observations of nature, Darwin’s books generally lacked genuine science (experimentation, data analysis, the formulation of testable hypotheses). Darwin had no understanding of genetics, and so he had no conception of how traits might be passed from one generation to the next. He only had a very vague notion of what natural selection might actually be acting upon. He simply pictured life as being inherently plastic and malleable, so evolution was inherently fluid and continuous (think Claymation). When Mendel’s genetic discoveries were eventually brought out of the closet, it could be seen that inheritance was largely based upon discrete and stable packets of information. That indicated that life and inheritance were not like Claymation, and that biological change over time was not based upon unlimited plasticity or fluidity. Mendel’s discrete units of information (later called genes), were clearly specific and finite, and so they only enabled specific and limited changes. At that time it was being said; “Mendelism has killed Darwinism”.

Aron Ra has this video series supposedly ""disproving"" the flood, and I thought I would watch some of it to debunk his arguments. I've only gotten around to this video, the one about zoology, and a bit about the geology video. I thought I would post some rebuttals here.

-point 1: the earth doesn't have enough water to produce a flood like the one in genesis.
 -Rebuttal: This is assuming that the mountains ( like everest) existed or were nearly as high as the ones we see today. Both of the popular flood models among mainstream creationist scientist (CPT and hydroplate) have the break up of pangea and the formation of mountains that we see today accounted in their models. However, he does go on to address this argument.

-point 2:The bible says there were already ""high mountains"" in existance at the time of the flood and that creationist models contradict the bible.
 -Rebuttal: The hebrew word used for mountain could also be translated to high hills. However, even ""high mountains"" is a subjective term and anti diluvian peoples like noah would've found much shorter mountains to be ""high mountains"" by their own standards. 

-Point 3:Mt. ararat couldn't have formed during the flood because its a stratovolcano.
 -Rebuttal:Your right, it was post flood volcanic activity that formed mt. ararat. heres an article if you want to read more.
https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/noahs-ark-found/noahs-ark-mount-ararat/
But the essence of it is that mount ararat would've formed on top of the flood layers below it from the magma that would've come from its eruptions. There have been 3 recorded eruptions from mt. ararat, one in 1783, 1450 and another in 550 bc. with probably more in the past.

-point 4:The ark couldn't have landed on ararat because its a volcano and it would've been forming during the flood.
 -Rebuttal: The bible states that it landed on the _mountains_ of ararat, referring to a mountain range. this is backed by the overwhelming consensus of biblical scholars and theologians.

-Point 5: He talks about the duripinar site and other false findings of the ark. Most creationist reject theses and the claims made from ron wyatt so I don't think this needs to be addressed.

-point 6:The creation account says the earth is a flat dome with glass surrounding it and that the stars are on this glass. 
  -Rebuttal: No, the word for firmanment in genesis is raqia. The literal meaning of this word is ""something that has been pounded or stretched out."" Because this is an action commonly done to metals, some people presume that this must mean a hard covering over the earth is whats being described. early english scholars presumed the same thing by translating raqia into firmanment, with the prefix being firm. Now, most scholars translate it as expanse. However, raqia doesn't just apply to hard things, in genisis 1:6 says a raqia divided the waters from the waters, the bible uses this word several times to describe this seperation and (genisis 1:8) to describe the skys. Its clear that this thing seperating the waters wasn't hard and that means he just calling heaven an expanse. The description of heavan as a raqia in other contexts that put heaven as space is why I believe the big bang theory is implied from genesis and thus YEC, but that's beside that point.

-point 7: He goes on to debunk the canopy model, but most creation scientist don't believe in this model so I don't see the need to address it.

Point 8: hydroplate theorys water chambers would be way to hot and  it would boil the earth
 -Rebuttal: I agree, since I'm not a believer of hydroplate theory but in catastrophic plate tectonics. But both theories have their heat problems and it is a topic of research among flood geologist and other creationist scientist.

-point 9:He goes on to argue against the comet and meteorite based flood models that exist, but these aren't even mainstream so I don't feel the need to address them

-Point 10: None of the models that he decided to mention explain were the water would've gone after the flood.
 -rebuttal: That's because you haven't mentioned catastrophic plate tectonics(if hydroplate has an explanation then feel free to explain.) The simple version( according to CPT) is that the new, hotter and less dense, plates would've risen in the ocean water. this would've caused the ocean to flood the earth until the oceanic plates cooled off and thus, sinking it down again to the levels we see today.

237,"possible solution to G-value paradox in biology, also a big problem for Darwinism",2,True,"[**advanced topic in molecular biology**]

Complex organisms like humans have fewer genes than rice, but the complexity is in what inside each gene -- quality, not quanitity.  :-)

Genes with ""Promiscuous Domains""  pose a problem for Darwinism.  These domain appear in multiple genes. This is really bad since this implies segments called ""Promiscuous Domains"" of one gene had to be cut-and-pasted precisely in another gene. In the case of the Pleckstrin Domain, there are 285 genes with this domain (consisting of 120 amino acids) in it.

See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleckstrin_homology_domain

But anyway, here is a paper about a possible solution to the G-value paradox that involve promiscuous proteins domains like Promiscuous Pleckstrin.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722818/

&gt;The propensity of protein domains to form multidomain architecture increases with organismal complexity. Though complexity is a contentious issue in evolution, here we define it as the number of cell types in an organism. The phenomenon that organisms with higher complexity tend to acquire more multidomain proteins is called ‘domain accretion’ [22], which could translate into increasing interaction amongst the domains. **This may be one of the explanations of the apparent lack of correlation between the complexity and number of genes in a genome (G-value paradox): flies have fewer genes than nematodes; humans have fewer genes than rice [23]. Increasing modularity through domain accretion, at least in theory, can overcome the shortcoming posed by fewer genes in the genome.** The biological mechanisms dictating domain accretion is not known. But, there is evidence that domains involved in the same functional pathway tend to come together in one protein sequence [24]. This phenomenon has been used to determine the functions of unknown domains in proteins, in what is called the ‘Rosetta Stone’ approach [24].

&gt;Given the large number of domains present in an organism, the possible combinatorial arrangements are enormous

239,My Short List: Why I am a Creationist,8,True,"I am a creationist, because I believe God exists, and so He does, at least to me. And He said He created the world, and He cannot lie, so it is. That is all I need.

Whenever I try to argue with an evolutionist, inevitably, they try to insult me for my lack of intellectual honesty or even my ignorance.

Here's the areas of science that I have behind me that totally disprove the naturalist/materialist explanations (Big Bang, abiogenesis, evolution) for the universe we see today. While these do not directly prove the existence or nature of God, they do push things in that direction.

First, a definition: Naturalism/Materialism is my generic term for the idea that nothing beyond the material or the natural universe exists. This is contradictory to the platonic reality of dual universes, one of material and the other of pure fantasy or if your prefer, the *supernatural*.

Now, the insurmountable evidences:

1. The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics predicts that the universe, over time, increases in entropy. Since we are not at maximum entropy, and the universe *must be* infinite (if naturalism is a thing), then either we are incredibly lucky (the anthropic principle), or something else is going on. Science says I must accept that something else is going on. The 2nd Law alone is enough to convince me that something is manipulating the universe with divine power that surpasses all of our understanding.

2. Suppose the Big Bang created the universe: what created the Big Bang? Since the universe did not exist, it cannot be anything that is part of the universe, hence, the Big Bang is contradictory to naturalism/materialism. (The First Law of Thermodynamics clearly states nothing comes from nothing. You cannot create or destroy energy (and with SR, mass-energy).) If you suppose the Big Bang to be a thing, then you believe in the platonic realism and thus must accept the existence of some supernatural power. I find people who try to maintain the naturalism/materialism philosophy *and* accept the Big Bang very puzzling.

3. Life cannot come from non-life. This has never been observed. There is no mechanical explanation for how it is even possible (we have yet to even understand it), and even those explanations which suppose that a chemical soup can somehow spontaneously form into a living organism cannot explain away the probability of that ever occurring, in even billions of universes. Thus, if you are a naturalist/materialist, you cannot accept abiogenesis, and must accept that life came from life and there is either an infinite regression (contradicting the Second Law) or a Big Bang (contradicting the First Law). Of course, you can introduce a supernatural power, an origin of life, so to speak, and the problem would be resolved.

4. Evolution remains unobserved. All we have are a pile of dirty bones, arranged exactly they way we did not expect to see them if evolution were a thing. Now with our understanding of DNA, we have solid proof that living things did not evolve from one another. The famous E. Coli experiment didn't show E. Coli turning into anything but E. Coli, and also demonstrated that evolution, if it does occur at all, is occurring in the *wrong* direction. Meaning, over time, our genetic code is degrading and I question whether there will be any life on planet earth when the sun finally burns out. Considering that the universe was created or maintained throughout infinity by some supernatural power, that life was created by a supernatural power, I find it very difficult to believe that the supernatural power has done this for no purpose, other than to watch life die. 

5. Evolution remains unscientific. How many more articles do you need to read where scientists were ""surprised"" to see something, or where they had to completely redefine evolution, before you understand that they are no better, and quite a lot worse in many ways, than any preacher of any religion? Give me a falsifiable theory, and then we can start to discuss science. The problem is, every falsifiable form of evolution has already been falsified.

The foundation of modern science itself is, in fact, a sincere and devout belief of the Bible, particularly, the Christian Bible. The belief in God, the belief that God made the universe, the belief that man was made in God's image, that God incarnated himself as a man, taught us, then died for us, so that we can become like Him, is the foundation of modern science. This religion, the Christian religion, has completely rewritten the subject of religion altogether, making it possible for smart people like Newton to put together the pieces so that we can begin to understand this magnificent creation of God's, the universe. It is precisely because we believe that we are the same sort of stuff that God is that allows us the hubris to try and understand his ways, and try and become like Him. As Jesus said, ""Come, Follow Me."" And so, as scientists, we try to follow Him and become more like Him, become more like a Creator of universes rather than inhabitants therein.

Although science can't tell us who God is or what He is like, it does point us towards *something* that surpasses the material universe, something that has created this universe or keeps it running, something that gave us life, something that probably has some great purpose in mind. Until you crack open a Bible and read what it says, you can't know much about that ""something"".",1512153059,70,2017-12-01 13:30:59
242,Carbon dating of Methuselah,6,True,"When talking to evolutionists about dendrochronology they love to point to carbon calibration, particularly [IntCal13](https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947/pdf), to suggest that the earth is old (More data [here](http://intcal.qub.ac.uk/intcal13/index.html)).

Generally the data is conspicuously a series of sequences of a few hundred years at a time. Awkward to be missing is a complete calibration of the oldest living trees like [Methuselah](http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm) (and Prometheus, which has a known death date). Instead, the oldest calibration dates I've heard of from living trees on the Methuselah walk is about 1000 BC, and continuous timelines back from the present only to about [500 AD](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JC078i036p08849/abstract).

Obviously, when dead trees (without a witnessed death date) are used, there are assumptions involved that any young earth creationist would not accept. For example many of the trees are dated by the fact that they were buried in the Younger-Dryas event, which I believe is dated using ice cores. Whenever possible, you would think it would be more straightforward to use living trees, and there are two that I know of not too far from each other, along with a third that was cut down in the 60s.

So what's wrong with Methuselah? I have heard, though I've looked and cannot verify, that dating the oldest parts of these trees gives carbon dates that are erratic, like the flood model tends to suggest, however I have not seen this specifically used in support of the model. If true you would think it should be, since dendrochronology is a stick that people love to beat creationists with.

&gt;The scientific method is a phrase Musk uses often when asked how he came up with an idea, solved a problem or chose to start a business. Here's how he defines it for his purposes, in mostly his own words:

&gt;1. Ask a question.

&gt;2. Gather as much evidence as possible about it. 

&gt;3. Develop axioms based on the evidence, and try to assign a probability of truth to each one.

&gt;4. Draw a conclusion based on cogency in order to determine: Are these axioms correct, are they relevant, do they necessarily lead to this conclusion, and with what probability?

&gt; 5. Attempt to disprove the conclusion. Seek refutation from others to further help break your conclusion.

&gt; 6. If nobody can invalidate your conclusion, then you're probably right, but you're not certainly right.

Never heard it spelled out that way, thought it might be a good conversation starter here.  

When looking at things that you can not experiment on I don't hold those sciences in high regard.  If they could spell out the probabilities I might trust them more.  ",1510866232,7,2017-11-16 16:03:52

&gt;Although the ultimate origins of RNA viruses are uncertain, it seems reasonable to assume that these infectious agents have a long evolutionary history, appearing with, or perhaps before, the first cellular life-forms (38). While the RNA viruses we see today may not date back quite this far, the evidence that some DNA viruses have evolved with their vertebrate hosts over many millions of years (24) makes an equally ancient history for RNA viruses a natural expectation. Yet a very different picture of RNA virus origins is painted if their gene sequences are compared; by using the best estimates for rates of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitution) and assuming an approximate molecular clock (21, 33), **it can be inferred that the families of RNA viruses circulating today could only have appeared very recently, probably not more than about 50,000 years ago.** Hence, if evolutionary rates are accurate and relatively constant, present-day RNA viruses may have originated more recently than our own species.",1510424998,9,2017-11-11 13:29:58
265,"The excellent, though unintentional, argument for dating Mitochondrial Eve to around 6,000 years ago...",13,True,"I first learned about [this study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14126594_A_high_observed_substitution_rate_in_the_human_mitochondrial_DNA_control_region) from [this presentation by Dr. Georgia Purdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deV99oPnKlI&amp;t=621s) .  I was curious, so I read it.  The following is my critique of it.


The reality of Mitochondrial Eve, that ancient female from whom all living humans have descended, is accepted as common knowledge among biologists and geneticists.  What is not common knowledge is how long ago she walked the earth.  Nevertheless, before TJ Parsons, DS Muniec, K Sullivan, et al., nobody dated her to within 100,000 years of the present.  Imagine their surprise, then, when these scientists inadvertently demonstrated that she may well be only around 6,500 years old, a date which corresponds remarkably to that time in which, according to the Bible, Adam gave his wife the name, “Eve,” because she would become the Mother of All Living.  As a consequence, these researchers unintentionally provided an excellent argument for the validity of the biblical timeline for Eve.

The reason Parsons and his team arrived at such a young date for Mitochondrial Eve appears in their method of calculating it.  Instead of calculating her date from inferences which assume evolution, they calculated it based on actual observations of “[t]he rate and pattern of sequence substitutions in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region.”  Specifically, they “compared DNA sequences…from close maternal relatives, from 134 independent mtDNA lineages spanning 327 generational events” (363).  In their own words, this is what they found (bolding mine):


The **observed** substitution rate reported here is very high compared to rates **inferred** from evolutionary studies….  A study yielding one of the faster estimates gave…an age for the mtDNA MRCA of 133,000 y.a. Thus, our observation of the substitution rate…is roughly 20-fold higher than would be predicted from phylogenetic analyses. Using our **empirical** rate to calibrate the mtDNA molecular clock would result in an age of the mtDNA MRCA of only ~6,500 y.a…. (365).

 
Notice the contrasting terminology here.  Their date is based on *empirical evidence* and *direct observation*.  The older dates are based on *inferences assuming common descent*.  These are their own words, not those of biblical creationists with a motive to favor the younger date over the older ones.  In fact, ironically, these are the words of people who favor the older dates over those of their own studies.

Of course, modesty and a respect for the limitations of the scientific method should bring any scientist to acknowledge the possibility that his conclusions are wrong, but Parsons and his team went well beyond this.  They did not simply acknowledge the possibility that they were wrong.  They took it for granted.  They wrote (bold mine), “Using our empirical rate to calibrate the mtDNA molecular clock would result in an age of the mtDNA MRCA of only ~6,500 y.a., clearly incompatible with the **known** age of modern humans” (365).  Notice the terminology again.  They did not say that their findings are incompatible with **the consensus opinion** or with **the commonly agreed upon idea** of the age of modern humans.  They said that they are incompatible with the **known** age of humans, as if there were some absolute standard, derivable from science, by which all other dates could be calibrated.  Surely, if pressed, they would acknowledge that there is no such absolute standard.  So why put it this way?  At least one of two reasons seem most likely to me:  either they themselves were dogmatically unwilling to accept a young date, or they feared that their colleagues would be unwilling to.  Both possibilities are disturbing. 
   
Naturally, Parson’s team sought explanations for how they arrived at such an uncomfortably young date for Mitochondrial Eve: “One initially attractive explanation,” they wrote, “is that we have observed substitutions predominantly at mutational 'hot spots…’” (365).  In the end, however, they themselves ruled out this possibility, writing, “This disparity cannot be accounted for simply by substitutions at mutational hot spots, suggesting additional [as yet unclear] factors that produce the discrepancy between very near-term and long-term apparent rates of sequence divergence” (363).  Additionally, they ruled out sequencing error as a factor in their young date for Mitochondrial Eve, pointing out that “The overall quality of sequence determination was demonstrated by replicate analyses in different laboratories for 63 individuals, with complete concordance of results” (367).

So, have we all, ultimately, come from the womb of one woman?  The consensus view of science is that we have.  Did this woman, the Great Mother of all living humans, walk the earth around six thousand years ago, as the Bible implies Eve did?  Nobody who is strictly confined by the scientific method will ever be able to answer this question conclusively.  It is a great irony, however, that one of the best scientific arguments for believing that she did comes unintentionally from the work of a team of scientists who rejected the possibility of such a scenario in the face of their own findings.

In the geologic layers, complexity increases as the layers move up. If the fossil of a more complex life form was found entirely out of place (such as a rabbit being found in a pre-Cambrian layer), the entire theory would be falsified. Nothing like that has ever been found.

Humans have 23 chromosomes from each parent, chimps have 24. There are markers on each chromosome that indicate the end of the chromosome and the center of the chromosome (telomeres and centromeres). There is one human chromosome that has, in order, an end marker, a middle marker, two end markers, another middle marker, and another end marker. It appears as though two chromosomes were fused together end-to-end, and there are two chromosomes in chimps that would be nearly identical to this human chromosome if they were fused together. Chromosomes being fused together have absolutely no impact on survivability, so why would God, if he created the Earth in 6 days, create humans with fused chromosomes? What purpose does fused chromosomes have other than being evidence for evolution?
(1) When scientists plot out the similarities and differences between the genomes and traits of different animals, they are able to form a hierarchical ""tree of life"" and get a very good idea of the common ancestry between different animals. The common creationist argument against this evidence is ""common design common designer. Why reinvent the wheel?"" (please correct me if I'm wrong or I am making a strawman). However, if there is DNA that serves no function whatsoever and there really is no common ancestry between different animals, then when the similarities between this non-coding ""junk"" DNA are plotted out, we should see a random, unorganized, mish-mosh of animals because there is no reason for God to ""reuse"" useless junk DNA. 

If there is useless DNA, then there should be no pattern if you plot out the similarities and differences between different animals, because God has no reason to ""copy and paste"" useless DNA among animals in an organized fashion. (2) Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) are viruses that, when they infect, permanently change their carrier's DNA, and this altered DNA can be passed on to their offspring. This extra DNA added by the ERV performs absolutely no beneficial or negative function for the organism. If there were a common ancestor between two animals that had one of these ERVs, then we should expect to find the remnants of that ERV in both of those animals DNA. We do find this, and geneticists can plot out these similarities and differences between the ERVs of different animals. 

When they do plot out these similarities and differences between the non-coding ""junk"" ERV DNA, they find the same exact evolutionary tree as they do when they plot out the similarities and differences of normal useful DNA. If there is no common ancestry among animals, what are the chances that plotting out the similarities and differences in useless, non-coding, ""junk"" ERV DNA would yield the same result that is found when you plot out the similarities and differences between useful DNA? God has no reason to ""reuse"" junk DNA in the same exact organized fashion as useful DNA.
All humans have the genetic code for a jaw muscle, but are born with an error in that code that leads to a muscle deficiency in that muscle. Why would God create humans with a muscle that is deficient in every human being from birth? A rebuttal I can foresee is this: When the fall of man occurred, many more problems were introduced into the world, such as genetic problems. However, this is negated by the fact that humans need this muscle to be deficient or else their skull would be strained by the muscles, which would prevent the full development of the brain. 

If God created humans in six days, then there could not have been a single point in time where this muscle was fully-developed in a human being because it would prevent proper brain growth. Another rebuttal I can forsee is this: If humans need that muscle to be deficient in order for their brain to grow properly, then it is actually a good design that the genetic code has an error, because if it did not, the brain could not grow properly. But why, if God created humans at his will, didn't God just write the genetic code for that jaw muscle as being a weaker or smaller muscle? There is absolutely no reason why God would create genetic code that has the potential for a very strong jaw muscle if only to create an error in that code to make it deficient. From the very beginning, God could have created that muscle to be weaker or smaller in the first place, or he could have placed the muscle in a certain location that would not cause strain on the brain if it is fully developed.
Again, this is for young-Earth creationists. If you believe evolution occurred and the Earth is 4.6 billion years old, I ask that if you do comment, it should be related to my question for how that evidence would be explained reasonably, and should not turn this into a debate over whether Genesis is intended to be taken literally or something of the like. Even if you are not a YEC, please point out any flaws or potential solutions.
I do not believe that these facts can be explained by young-Earth creationists reasonably or scientifically if they do not believe that evolution occurred.

No error bars overlap.  So what is going on?  I understand C^14 is detected so that implies the fossils are younger than 60,000 years or so, but why do different samples and labs and methods give such wildly different dates?  Why should the distribution of C^14 be so uneven across a given specimen?

And to what extent is this typical of carbon dating in general?  And other radiometric datings beside carbon?

Regarding the Acambaro figurines discussed at the bottom of my first link, the article describes them as ""skillfully sculptured"" and ""carefully decorated"" but are they really that impressive?  They look like something a 6 year old could make.  I would still regard [many of them](http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-acambaro-dinos.htm) as unambiguous likenesses of dinosaurs though.

274,An observation about what may be a population problem regarding a young Earth.,3,True,"All,

I am hoping you can help me, as an ID, YEC and Christian, to source some academic, scholarly or otherwise well thought out literature on the subject of population doubling rates since Adam and Eve and/or the Deluge. Most of the websites I've found pick a population doubling rate, do a bit of math and arrive at *x percent per year* or something along those lines. However, it doesn't seem to account for all of the variance even in the census data we have. For example, some estimates like those found [here](http://worldometers.info) suggest the population was only five million around 5000 BCE, and didn't reach 50 million until 1000 BCE. That's a 1000% increase in four millenia, if my math is right, which at this hour it may not be, or a double rate of 400 years.

275,Do Shared ERVs Support Common Ancestry?,2,True,"The article, [“Do Shared ERVs Support Common Ancestry?”](https://evolutionnews.org/2011/05/do_shared_ervs_support_common_/) is an excellent response to [“Three Layers of Endogenous Retroviral Evidence for the Evolutionary Model”](http://www.evolutionarymodel.com/ervs.htm) , which is often cited by evolutionists who believe ERVs do support common ancestry.  I have a question, however, concerning the number of ERVs we share with chimps.  According to “Three Layers,” we have ~200 thousand ERVs and share most of them with chimps.  

I notice, however, that in claiming this, they are reacting to a widespread belief that we only share 7-14 with chimps.  Fueling this popular belief that we share so few ERVs with chimps is (ironically) [this piece from Talk Origins](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html#retroviruses) , which cites the total number of ERVs in humans at ~30,000, only 7 of which are common to chimps.  

I understand that the Talk Origins article is out of date (2004), but, interestingly, the ""Three Layers” article does not cite the use of outdated information as the reason “so many” are “claiming that it's only around 7 or 14.”  They seem to imply that those who are claiming it is 7-14 are not using the right criteria for identifying ERVs: “With so many claiming that it's only around 7 or 14, an important question is; just how many ERVs do humans share with chimpanzees? The answer is that humans and chimpanzees share virtually all of them. **We know this is the case for two reasons; examination of indel variation, and whole-genome analysis.”**

297,What effect might Planet Nine have on creationism?,10,True,"Scientists have found several Kuiper belt objects with a similar orientation in their orbits that all look exactly as if they'd been affected by the gravity of a large planet in a highly elliptical orbit that stretches several times farther away than Neptune. They're currently looking for this ""Planet Nine"" and should know for certain if it exists within a few years, perhaps as soon as a few weeks. This would be one of the greatest astronomical discoveries in recent history.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine
http://www.wired.co.uk/article/we-are-closer-than-ever-to-finding-planet-nine

Due to the size of this orbit, it is predicted to have an orbital period of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The discovery may not happen, but since there seems to be a high possibillity at this point, I think it's worth preparing for the challenge this might propose to young-earth creationism, and what responses we might see. For example,

- Some may question the length of the orbit, as it would not be empirically verified, however it may be risky to challenge Kepler's laws of planetary motion, especially since the regularity of those laws is a powerful apologetic for a divinely-established orderly universe.

- Some may question whether or not the planet has completed an orbit since creation. The strength of this response will depend on the specifics of the orbit and the evidence for its effect on the orbits of other objects.

- Some may move toward YEC models that allow for older ages of celestial objects, such as the ""biosphere model"" or ""white hole cosmology"", which [AIG has endorsed as possibilities](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/starlight/a-proposal-for-a-new-solution-to-the-light-travel-time-problem/), or ""Young Life Creationism,"" or towards other views like Old-Earth creationism (OEC), which in my opinion is a fully viable Scriptural interpretation.

I am not committed to a particiular Scriptural interpretation that constrains the age of the solar system, but I respect many Christians who are. If this potential discovery would not be seen as a serious challenge to those views, I would love to see what kinds of creative and intelligent responses might be offered to those that would have questions about it. If this discovery would be seen as a challenge, or if some might find such responses unsatisfying, I would rather see such Christians prepared to consider other possibilities rather than face a crisis of faith.

A couple questions:

1. Are there other plausible explanations for why smaller dinosaur fossils are typically found at slightly higher elevations relative to their larger counterparts apart from being rapidly deposited via global flood?

2. If survival of the fittest is still the primary mechanic upon which evolutionary theory is predicated, why does extinction occur? 

3. If the most reasonable explanation for #2 is something related to ecosystem interdependence, what is the prevailing theory as to why any life survived at all during the mass extinction event thought to have wiped out most, if not all of the dinosaurs?

4. I recently read an article which alleged that one of the leading contributors to carbon emissions is livestock. Apparently cows are gassy. However, dinosaurs were presumably gassy, too, and in no short supply during their time on Earth. Why wasn't this an issue then?

5. Are there any tenable explanations for why sea-based creatures earlier in history have been since found fossilized where they ought not be? Mosasaurs on mountains, etc.

6. Any thoughts on the origin of the Shnebley Hill Formation situated near the Grand Canyon, given its unique position displacing an otherwise entirely consistent shelf comprising the Kaibab Limestone?

7.

301,Some questions about polystrate fossils...,8,True,"It seems to me that the argument from polystrate fossil trees is this: Fossils form by rapid burial; therefore, these tree fossils formed by rapid burial in the material that now encases them.  Since the trees could not have been buried over millions of years, these layers of rock encasing them, which are conventionally dated to millions of years, do not in fact represent millions of years. 


The counterargument must demonstrate that the material which now encases the trees is not the material which initially buried them. This demonstration has two stages.  The first is to show that the material that originally encased them is gone.  The second is to demonstrate that the material encasing them now has been added over a period of millions of years, after the tree was fossilized.


I have been convinced [by upright fossilized trees standing alone](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-bioarchaeology.htm#) that stage one can be explained by erosion:  The living tree was buried by ash or some other material that formed into relatively soft rock while the buried tree fossilized into relatively harder rock.  Then the soft rock eroded away, leaving the standing fossilized trees.
  
That seems reasonable to me.

But what of stage two, the reencasement?  Since the encasing rock layers are dated to millions of years, the process of encasement must have taken millions of years if the dates are correct.  But my questions are these:

  
Why should I believe that the process of erosion would stop at the base of the tree?  The tree was not rooted in hard rock to begin with but dirt. Am I to imagine a process of erosion which removes many feet of soft rock but then leaves the underlying soil untouched?  It seems to me the fossil trees will eventually topple over under these conditions once the soil beneath them erodes away.  If what was the underlying dirt has, itself, become stone as hard as the fossilized tree, do we find examples of this, of fossilized trees rooted in a layer of hard rock?  [That, at least, is not the case with this tree,](http://www.icr.org/article/classic-polystrate-fossil/) which is rooted in coal.  


Assuming that the tree is rooted in hard rock, and the process of erosion stops at its base, why should I believe that loose sediments would then begin to collect around the base of the fossilized tree?  Erosion has removed yards of soft rock from this area.  Why would it now permit loose sediment to collect over the millions of years necessary for the reencasement (remember the process must take millions of years for the dating to be correct)?

303,What is your opinion on the Omphalos hypothesis?,2,True,"Mandatory 'Theistic evolutionist here' disclaimer. 

But here's something that has long puzzled me. When I've talked with creationists, I've been told that the Omphalos hypothesis is practically a slur against creationists - this insulting idea that they would never embrace, etc. They prefer testable theories, God would never do such a thing, etc, etc. Variations on that.

Which baffles me, because I always thought the Omphalos hypothesis was surprisingly tenable as a Creationist view. Surprisingly because I originally heard about it in a mocking context, but when I looked it up and thought about it, I found myself thinking it was a sharper idea than I had been led to believe.

I think what tends to throw people off is the idea of God intentionally creating a deceptive world in order to throw people off. That invites the Loki/trickster god objections, not to mention the idea that the Logos is a massive troll. Those always struck me as weak objections on examination, since it relies on the idea that God 'lies' by means of creating a world which we form theories about, and the theories turn out to be wrong - which seems extraordinarily reaching. If that's the standard, God is already 'lying' on several other counts, like the fall of geocentrism, which if nothing else seemed incredibly obvious based on the evidence for a long time.

306,Carbonaceous chondrite meteorite discussion,3,True,"These meteorites have organic compounds in them and are mysterious. They are quite rare too. What do we know about them?

Some of them have compounds that can't survive temperatures over 50C, so how did they make it to earth (heat of entry)?

They have some amino acids and nucleobases (eg. adenine). I think that there are some of these molecules that we don't find on earth, but I'd like confirmation of this.  

The fact that they have these organic molecules leads to the idea that they might be the origin of the constituents of RNA and DNA that made up the first living organisms on earth. The nucleobases came from the asteroids (?), rather than being generated de novo on earth. [I'm not sure if there is an important distinction between these meteorites and these asteroids. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-type_asteroid#Characteristics ]

Has anyone investigated whether these meteorites could originally be of terrestrial origin? For example: Life is thought (by evolution) to have begun 3 or 4 billion years ago. There have been [massive impacts from meteors](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130214-biggest-asteroid-impacts-meteorites-space-2012da14/) millions to billions of years ago. Could debris from these have been ejected into space to form these carbonaceous chondrite meteorites?   The moon cannot be more than 1.5 billion years ago (because it is receding and before that it would be inside the Roche Limit and would not form into a solid body). The current leading theory is that it was formed by an impact of some large object with earth. If this object can launch so much material into earth's orbit to form a moon, it could also launch smaller chunks further out to form meteors and asteroids

If the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites had a terrestrial origin, then that removes an important (but maybe not critical) part of the solution to abiogenesis.  Could these non-terrestrial organic molecules have started out as the familiar ones here on earth, but then been changed by whatever ejected them into space?

On the other hand, maybe the alien amino acids/nucleobases mean that these meteorites have a non-terrestrial origin. If so, where did they come from? I don't think that there are any really clear definite answers (yet). 

This article (http://www.pnas.org/content/108/34/13995.full ) states ""An **extraterrestrial origin for most of the amino acids** detected in carbonaceous chondrites **has been firmly established** based on three factors: the detection of racemic amino acid mixtures (i.e., equal mixtures of D and L amino acids), wide structural diversity (including the presence of many nonprotein amino acids that are rare or **nonexistent in the biosphere),** and nonterrestrial values for compound-specific deuterium, carbon, and nitrogen isotope measurements (3–13). In contrast to amino acids, nucleobases in meteorites have been far less studied.""

I thought about asking on /r/debateEvolution, but then realised that I'd just get tons of replies saying that ""abiogenesis is already proven"" despite there being no example in any lab or anywhere that can demonstrate, even just once, the origin of life from non-life. 

People still seem to believe in abiogenesis so strongly that they are unable to contemplate any alternatives (well, except for maybe panspermia).  One would think that analysing various aspects of life and biochemistry would show that there are insurmountable gaps that cannot be crossed with incremental evolutionary changes. One such analysis by Dr. Paul Nelson is described below.

--------------------------
_A quote from http://www.quarkphysics.ca/scripsi/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mensa-Life-imitates-Life.pdf_

An interesting way of examining this problem is Dr Paul Nelson’s idea of looking at the functions of a cell 
and seeing how simple a cell can be while still existing as a living organism. This is similar to the criteria of 
life laid out in high school science classes, but here we are assuming that the cell is a basic unit of life and 
looking at its functions. Aside from this assumption, we don’t need to specify certain organelles or DNA, 
just functions that are general enough for any type of life of alien or terrestrial origin.

**Anything that is alive must**

1. separate itself from its surroundings with some sort of boundary (this is the cell membrane). 
2. transport nutrients into the cell and transport waste out.
3. metabolize nutrients into whatever it needs.   
Subsets of metabolism are   
a. converting energy from food or sunlight into a form that can be used by the cell (ATP, GTP).  
b. manufacturing required molecules (proteins, vitamins, nucleotides, etc) needed to perform 
needed functions.  
4. have some template or library to store the patterns of molecules that need to be manufactured.     
a. This information needs to be stored somewhere safe (and ideally should have continuous 
error correction).  
b. It needs to be duplicated accurately for daughter organisms.  
c. The templates need to be able to move from the storage site to the production site.  
5. reproduce into daughter organisms. 

**Which of these can be removed without killing the cell?**  
Removing #1, the cell boundary, means that the organism (cell) would just fall apart.  
Removing #2, active transport, means that the cell would run out of raw materials and energy. The cell 
would also choke to death in its own waste. (Passive transport by diffusion and osmosis is unlikely to ever be sufficient for this.)  
Removing #3, metabolism, would kill the cell.  Without metabolism no new molecules, proteins, enzymes, etc. can be made. The cell will break down as these molecular machines wear out and no more are created.  
Removing #4, information storage and reproduction, would also kill the cell fairly soon. Without this the cell will not be able to actually build the molecules that it needs because it does not know what parts they are made of and how to assemble them.  
Removing #5, reproduction, is possible.  Reproduction is not really a criterion for being alive, but without this the cell would have to live forever.  

**Which of these can exist without the others?**

* Only #1. A boundary is quite easy to have by itself – it is just a bubble or a phospholipid bilayer, but 
is it by no means alive.
* Removing #2 means that no new materials come into the cell, so #3, #4, and #5 break down too.
* If metabolism, #3, is removed, then transportation will no longer work because the transport proteins are no longer created, and information translation/transcription/replication can not longer be done. Thus, removing #3 ruins #2, #,4 and #5. 
* Removing #4 means that no new molecules can be created, so #2, #3, and #5 also stop working.

In summary, transportation, metabolism, and information storage all depend on each other. Reproduction depends on these three too, but they do not in turn require it.

It looks like there is a large gap between the simplest living thing and the most complex non-living thing. 
We don’t know how to close this gap.  Maybe there is a “qi” or “nephesh” after all. **The essential functions 
of a cell are one big complex interconnected mess that all have to be there at once. They cannot be built in 
parts nor disassembled piece by piece, while allowing the cell to stay alive.** As Dr. Stuart Kauffman (1995) 
observes, “All living things seem to have a minimum complexity below which it is impossible to go.”

312,“This is not an argument that Darwinism cannot make complex functional systems; it is an observation that it does not.” - Michael Behe,26,True,"The following is a summary of points I gleaned from [William Lane Craig’s debate with Francisco Ayala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfylw5okAag&amp;t=2006s) and [Michael Behe’s talk at the Discovery Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sspt5Bdmug&amp;t=245s) about his book *The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of Darwinism.*

The best examples of Darwinian evolution work by breaking or removing what is already there.

99% of mutations are detrimental.  

Of the 1% that are accidentally beneficial, the vast majority, in fact all of the ones that we actually see, break genes and degrade overall function.


Sickle cell hemoglobin is an excellent example of this.  The human immune system has not been able to develop resistance to malaria by adding information to the genome (in spite of thousands of years of severe pressure to do so).  Its greatest success has been a very simple mutation that changes only one thing by substitution: amino acid ""e"" has switched for ""v.""  Unfortunately, the consequence of degrading the genome in this way is sickle cell anemia. 

 
As for malarial parasites (single cell organisms) themselves, they have been very good at resisting drugs developed to fight them because resistance only involves simple mutations.  


For instance, resistance to the drug atovaquone requires a change of a single amino acid in the malarial parasite; this occurs randomly in one in three patients.


Notice, however, how their ability to fight the drug lessens **exponentially** when just one more mutation is required.


Resistance to the drug chloroquine requires a change of **two amino acids**; here resistance randomly occurs in **one in a billion patients.**


One individual with malaria contains, on average, over one trillion malarial cells in his body.  There are 10^20 malarial cells produced every year.  This has been going on, at a minimum, for thousands of years, and yet all those trillions upon trillions of mutations have not overcome sickle cell hemoglobin because of the complexity of the mutations required (multiple simultaneous mutations or a sequence of specific mutations all occurring randomly.)  


Compare this with large animals, whose rate of reproduction is orders of magnitude slower, and one begins to see just how powerless Darwinian evolution is as an explanation for all life on earth.   


In fact, Behe says that there have been 10^40 cells in history of life (allowing that life has been here for four billion years).  **Thus, in the history of life, if one needed a mutation that was twice as complex as what malaria needs to overcome chloroquine, it would be mathematically “beyond the capacity of life on earth to generate by random mutation.”**

313,Viewpoints of appearance of age,10,True,"Here are two interesting viewpoints on appearance of age:

&gt;(OEC)[Appearance of age claims that God created a world with a false history. Such a claim is directly refuted by the Bible, which claims that God's creation declares His glory and righteousness. Nowhere does any biblical author make the claim that God's word contradicts any historical facts.  Ultimately, the claim that the God of creation would lie to us with a false history of the universe, is a direct attack on the righteous character of God and cannot be tolerated within the Church!](http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/appearance.html)  

&gt;(YEC) [God, in His sovereignty, knew that fallen man, living in the post-Flood world might wrongly conclude the age and origin of things. For just that reason, He gave us a clear record of what He had done and when He had done it.

Personally I don't think that ANY creation *ex nihilo* could exist without the appearance of age.

In the thread in question. The OP asked a theoretical question about 'what if' evolutionists extended the time frame for evolution. 

I answered the OP's question with If a biologist finds evidence that extends the time needed for evolution, then it creates problems for all the other disciplines that relate to that same time frame.

FOUR TROLLS in this forum jump on that with strawmen accusations of conspiracy theory nutbaggery.  Not one, not two, but FOUR.  That's a lot of trolls who can't even follow a basic conversation.  One of them had the audacity to ask me site examples of a theorethical question! 

It really cannot get any more ridiculous! I'm not even going to mention the nutter who was spouting off about sinning for Jesus. 

Trolls are filling this sub reddit to maximum capacity with low quality strawmen and sparsely hidden ad hominem attacks. 

""Oh look 4_jacks noticed that geologist and biologist share the same evolutionary time frame, HE MUST BE A CRAZY CONSPIR_TARD"" 

Why is that pathetic strawman tolerated in this subreddit? Why is that thinly veiled ad hominem attack tolerated on this subreddit? 

I know the moderators put in a lot of work.  And it is a thankless task. It's a difficult situation and there are no easy answers.

In other news, I think I've been nominated for the /r/DebateEvolution ['You Mad Brah?'](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/346/741/fde.jpg) Award. [Make sure to vote for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/741pnr/rcreation_i_warned_you_this_would_happen_or/). I think I win a hat or something. 

Speaking of /r/DebateEvolution, King of ""CircleJerk land"" had the audacity to [call /r/Creation a ""Echo Chamber""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/73ojpk/another_disaster_in_the_making_rcreation_is_there/dnv9yi1/).  Seriously, has any creationist, besides /u/stcordova ever visited /r/debateevolution? The rest of his post is gibberish, he sure as hell didn't get a report from me about ""Harassment"" so I don't know what he's replying to me for. I guess I have his benevolent protect now though.  I will give him credit where credit is due, he was able to acknowledge his sub for what it is,** a mob**. He was able to attempt to debate me without a strawman. And lastly 'take your knocks' is sage advice. His interpretation of that advice however is terrible.  I appreciate his invitation to join the garbage pit, but no thanks. 

I think all this speaks very clearly to the point of this post. **/r/Creation Should go back to a private sub**. Let /r/CreationExposed do it's thing. Heck, Invite their bot in.  Let them have their little echo chamber to post memes and make fun of us. I would really like to hear from the mods on this issue.  Or if any creationists can think of a reason to remain public, please response!  Maybe I'm missing something.

For me, it was the [The Lie: Evolution](https://answersingenesis.org/answers/books/the-lie-evolution/) that taught me what I did not not realized about, which I will quote one part from the book:

&gt; One of the reasons why creationists have such difficulty in talking to certain evolutionists is because of the way bias has affected the way they hear what we are saying. They already have preconceived ideas about what we do and do not believe. They have prejudices about what they want to understand in regard to our scientific qualifications, and so on.

321,Need help coming up with an allegory (simplify an argument),2,True,"Edit: Analogy!  I mean to say analogy! Stupid autocorrect

Hey, guys. So, I was listening to a philosophy podcast who's narrator was clearly an agnostic with a bent against the Christian God. I knew this, of course, and it didn't bother me for the first 90 episodes until he echoed something that Dawkins once said: "" Ok, alright, I'll *concede* (to Creationists) that it's *possible* that the fossil record was just a BIG RUSE by God to make us believe evolution was true when it really wasn't."" Honestly, I was disappointed in him, having been reasonable up until this point. 

Now, y'all should know, I'm actually quite ignorant about the science that goes on in this sub, but I can spot silly reasoning when I see it. If you're not already on board with me, hear me out. The problem with this logic is fairly simple, but surprisingly difficult to explain (hence my need for an analogy). Here goes:

""I'll *concede* (to Creationists) that it's *possible* that the fossil record was just a BIG RUSE by god to make us believe evolution was true when it really wasn't""....as if that *must* be the case if true

Who's really responsible, mr. podcaster, for making you believe that your methods of dating were reliable? Did God tell us that Carbon 14 would be reliable method of dating fossils accurate to thousands or millions of years? No, mr. podcaster, that was *your* presumption. Who's really responsible for making you believe that fossils, regardless of proximity or similarity, was ever evidence of anything more than dead animals? Did God tell us they were connected? No, mr. podcaster, that was *you* too. David Hume would rightly note that causes are not *seen* or *observed*, rather they are *created* in the mind of the observer. Is it really God's fault if you wrongly assumed the incorrect causes of your observations? Is it really God's fault that *you*, mr. podcaster, *assumed* that if carbon dating was accurate to a few decades, that it would also be accurate to the ends of the earth, without interruption? Or that if a life can mutate to any degree, that it would also be able to mutate to the N'th degree? No, mr. podcaster, that would be *you* too. This kind of reasoning is analogous to.........(This is where I draw a blank. but if you followed my argument this far, you can see how I would need one)

Here is a beautiful testimony:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/6ziyra/my_path_from_atheism/


&gt;12ish, I abandoned God and considered myself an Atheist. I was a bit of a computer nerd and spent alot of time on the internet. Here, I learned evolution and basically came to accept that God wasn't real. I had made some friends from 6-9th grade that pretty much backed up this idea, and we all became pretty anti-theist.



....

&gt;I began to think the Lord was trying to get to me, haha. I began to pray, really opening my heart. I apologized for ""not knowing the formality of this,"" and chuckling as I kneeled at my bedside and clenched my fists. I apologized for my sins, and asked for forgiveness. I prayed for guidance, and for Him to lead me on the path of righteousness. I began going to my friend's church with him. I liked it. In fact, I loved it.

My goal in posting at r/creation is to introduce reasonable scientific doubt into the claims of Darwinism.

Given that God created the universe, it must follow that he created time and thusly preceded it.

Given that God is omniscient, he sees all time: past, present, and future all at once.

Given that he sees all time at once, there is no reason that creating a universe that would foster life through evolution is not the same as creating all that ever would be in an instant.

If God speaks of events chronologically it is to help us understand.

Genesis can be literally true without disagreeing with the scientific interpretation of the universe when you read it from God's perspective.

It can be understood as God's design for the world before he set it in motion.

God's chronology need not match ours; he acts in all time at once.

The title sums up its thesis: **""Why Darwin was wrong about the tree of life.""** Below are two quotes from it which capture its spirit.

 ""Michael Syvanen, biologist of the University of California, Davis, recently compared 2000 genes that are common to humans, frogs, sea squirts, sea urchins, fruit flies and nematodes. In theory, he should have been able to use the gene sequences to construct an evolutionary tree showing the relationships between the six animals. He failed. The problem was that different genes told contradictory evolutionary stories.""

""The more closely related two groups are (the more recently their branches on the tree split) the more alike their DNA, RNA, and protein sequences ought to be."" 

But apparently they are not finding that this is the case when applied to the idea of universal common ancestry.  RNA often tells one story while DNA tells another.  I'm also reading an [article in Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/phylogeny-rewriting-evolution-1.10885) (""Phylogeny:Rewriting evolution"") about a similar problem that emerges when making a tree based on microRNA.

334,"The mistreatment of Ota Benga, examples of racism in Darwinism",7,True,"Darwin asserted the ""Preservation of FAVORED races.""  This led to things the treatment of black people like animals. 

Example.  Ota Benga:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ota_Benga
&gt;Ota Benga (c. 1883[1] – March 20, 1916) was a Congolese man, a Mbuti pygmy known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri in 1904, and in a human zoo exhibit in 1906 at the Bronx Zoo. Benga had been purchased from African slave traders by the explorer Samuel Phillips Verner, a businessman hunting African people for the Exposition.[2] He traveled with Verner to the United States. At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in Virginia, for the rest of his life.

&gt;Displays of non-white humans as examples of ""earlier stages"" of human evolution were common in the early 20th century, when racial theories were frequently intertwined with concepts from evolutionary biology. African-American newspapers around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. Dr. R. S. MacArthur, the spokesperson for a delegation of black churches, petitioned the New York City mayor for his release from the Bronx Zoo.

&gt;The mayor released Benga to the custody of Reverend James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn and made him a ward. That same year Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped, so the young man could be more readily accepted in local society. Benga was tutored in English and began to work. Several years later, the outbreak of World War I stopped ship passenger travel and prevented his returning to Africa. This, as well as the inhumane treatment he was subjected to for most of his life, caused Benga to fall into a depression. He committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.[3]

Did Adam and Eve have immune systems in the Garden of Eden? Or was it given to them only after the Fall? Did they have a blood type?

336,My attempt at an analogy describing the difference between microevolution and macroevolution.,4,True,"Let us consider Ernest Hemingway’s *The Old Man and the Sea.*  The mechanisms of change are 

EDITORIAL SELECTION FOR NARRATIVE COHERENCE (natural selection) This can only select from what is already there.  It cannot add information.  Narrative coherence symbolizes survival to reproduce.

SCRIBAL ERROR (random mutations)  

Below are some examples of the microevolution of the text.
  
From the Original Genome: 
*Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me.*

**Potential variations** by means of editorial selection acting on scribal error **that do not result in additional information**:

Pull, hands, he thought. Last for me, head. Last for me.

Pull, hands, he thought. Last me, head. Last for me.

Pull, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last.

Pull, he thought. Hold up. Last for me, head. Last for me.

Pull, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last, head. Last for me.

Pull. Hold up. Last for me. Last for me.

These examples reflect the fact that the overwhelming majority (some say all) of circumstantially beneficial mutations are losses of information.   
 
Below is a potential sequence of **variation that does result in novel information**, although even here the gain is balanced by a loss. 
 
1st Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, up legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. (The duplication of “up,” goes unnoticed by the editors.)

2nd  Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, upleg. Last for me, head. Last for me. (The compounding of “up” and “leg,” as well as the deletion of “s” also goes unnoticed by the editors.)

3rd Generation: Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, peleg. Last for me, head. Last for me.  (The deletion of “u” and insertion of “e” also go unnoticed by editors.)

It may seem unlikely that this one part would be both so prone to mistakes and so consistently overlooked by the editors, but let us grant the scenario for the sake of argument. 
 
“Peleg,” at this point, could qualify as new information, the proper name of a character whom Santiago is exhorting to “hold up.”  But who is Peleg?  How did he get in the boat?  How will he fit into the overall narrative?  **Microevolution** is the belief that all of the above variations are possible, but that “Peleg” will, sooner rather than later, be edited out.
  
**Macroevolution** is the belief that Peleg could stay, that by the same mechanisms identified above he could become the character Peleg in Herman Melville’s *Moby Dick*, that *The Old Man in the Sea* could itself transform around this character into Melville’s novel (another story about a man hunting a great sea creature) a story with far more information, a different narrative and different characters, all working seamlessly together and giving a remarkable “appearance of design.”

[How could anyone not be *at least skeptical* of such a claim?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c)  (See about 1:20.)

[This is good too, and in keeping with the whale theme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S89IskZI740) (See about 11:00.)

For fun, we can suggest an analogy with abiogenesis if we pretend that the original manuscript of *The Old Man and the Sea* appeared in its entirety as the result of a monkey playing with a goose quill, an ink pot, and some parchment.  To be fair, we will give him a billion years to accomplish the task.

If you don’t know already (and I expect most here do) Ron Wyatt claimed to have discovered Noah’s Ark in Turkey.

However, [I soon found a solid refutation of the claim published by Dr. Andrew Snelling in Answers in Genesis.](https://answersingenesis.org/creationism/arguments-to-avoid/special-report-amazing-ark-expose/)

Of course, I was mildly disappointed but, ironically, reading the refutation was also encouraging.  For some, the term “creationist” is synonymous with “liar.”  Many believe that creationists are so desperate to validate the Bible that they will lie about or remain willfully ignorant of facts in order to do so.  Dr. Snelling’s refutation of Ron Wyatt’s claim, however, contradicts this view.  In Snelling we have a man who believes in the historicity of Noah’s Flood and who, like me, would be very excited to find Noah’s Ark.  Nevertheless, because in his trained opinion the object alleged to be Noah’s Ark was simply a geological formation, he said as much and demonstrated why.  As I said, I was a little disappointed but encouraged overall by his honesty and his desire to present only credible arguments in support of his beliefs.  ",1505523911,4,2017-09-15 21:05:11
340,The Cost of Accepting Evidence,3,True,"Hi there ... I'm a new ""guest"" submitter on this sub. I'm a lapsed Jehovah's Witness, and just wanted to share a thought and get some feedback.

In my personal experience, when I was still fully in the faith, I was always looking for ways to dismiss or discount evidence for evolution because I believed my life depended on it. Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses meant that under no circumstances was I able to accept the evidence for evolution by natural selection. If I did, I would risk losing my friends and family in the faith today, and lose my prospect for everlasting life tomorrow. Simply put, the cost of accepting the evidence for evolution was too high. It didn’t matter how many facts were shown to me, there was simply no way I could accept them. The costs were just too high.

I came across a few articles recently – one from *Time* magazine, **[How to Fix American Stupidity](http://time.com/4937675/how-to-fix-american-stupidity/)**, and the other from *The Atlantic*, **[How America Lost Its Mind](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/how-america-lost-its-mind/534231/)**. Both articles provide a pretty healthy dis against people of faith. The *Time* article in particular says:

&gt;“By stupidity I do not mean a lack of knowledge, education, skill, or savvy...Stupidity is a kind of intellectual stubbornness. A stupid person has access to all the information necessary to make an appropriate judgement, to come up with a set of reasonable and justified beliefs and yet fails to do so. The evidence is staring them right in the face but it makes no difference whatsoever. They believe what they want to believe. Not only do they have no good reasons for thinking that what they believe is true — there are often good reasons for thinking what they believe is false. They are not acting in a rational manner.""

Ouch. But here’s where I disagree with this author. Jehovah’s Witnesses (and many other Christians) refuse to accept the evidence for evolution in part because of the social costs of doing so. Accepting the evidence means being removed from the community and losing one’s social structure. Since humans are social beings, and our communities and relationships are a critical aspect of satisfaction in life, I’d suggest that holding onto irrational beliefs (e.g., not accepting natural selection) is in fact quite rational as it ensures that we preserve our social ties.

Does anyone else ever have these feelings? Would you ever be relieved if you were “allowed” to accept the evidence for evolution? If accepting the facts didn’t jeopardize your relationships with everyone you hold dear in your life?

342,If microorganisms and cells are subject to evolution why isn't all life?,3,True,"Many creationists accept that microbes are subject to evolution. Evolution is also seen in cellular processes like the adaptive immune response (explained below for those unfamiliar). Why evolution is compartmentalized and rejected when applied to larger organisms seems to be directly related to how such evolutionary conclusions falsify religious ideals. It strikes me as inelegant that a designer would utilize evolution in microorganisms and subsets of cells but somehow disconnect evolution from other organisms.

-----------------------------------------

The three core principles of evolution: variation (mutation), heredity and selection are central to a successful adaptive immune response.

The diversity of foreign molecules (antigens) is matched by the diversity of the antibody repertoire (expressed by B-cells). Before antibodies evolve toward a specific antigen, incredible *mutational diversity* is generated through recombination and editing of a variety of genes. In this way up to 10^11 different antibody receptors can be generated.

Antigen naive cells are exposed to antigen and by chance some of the naive B-cells will bind to the antigen. There is *competition* between the B-cells and those cells with higher antigen affinity are *selected* by receiving survival signals and proliferate with the daughter cells *inheriting* the same antibody receptor.

Further *variation* is introduced into the selected B-cells by enzyme mediated editing that rapidly and randomly introduces *mutations*. Again these cells *compete* for antigen with the best binders being *selected*. Further *mutation* is introduced with more rounds of *selection*. This process can occur many times with some antibodies accumulating more than 30% mutation compared to germline. Mutations that are introduced include non synonymous changes, deletions and insertions.

-----------------------------------------

For those that require definitions, you'll find that the meaning of selection, heredity and mutation are the same whether applied to the evolution of humans, viruses or antibodies:

Selection: a process in which environmental or genetic influences determine which types of organism thrive better than others, regarded as a factor in evolution.

Heredity: the passing on of physical or mental characteristics genetically from one generation to another.

Mutation: the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form which may be transmitted to subsequent generations, caused by the alteration of single base units in DNA, or the deletion, insertion, or rearrangement of larger sections of genes or chromosomes.",1505389955,42,2017-09-14 07:52:35

344,Why people believe in Evolution,1,True,"Recently I tried to convince an atheist of intelligent design. I explained to him how unlikely the probability of life simply developing and evolving in human beings was, and how it is much more rational to assume that an intelligent agent was at work. I explained to him how when we come upon an ancient ruin, our first thought is not ""oh this must have resulted from natural causes,"" but rather ""these ruins must have been built!"" I then explained how astronomically more complex life is. At the end of the debate he simply shrugged his shoulders and said, ""Well maybe God created the universe, or maybe there's an infinite number of universes and the universe we live in is the only one we could live in, and it's the way it is because out of the infinite number of universes it was bound to happen. I guess we'll never know."" I think this was a very powerful lesson. The truth is that people will believe whatever they want to believe. As Socrates once famously said, ""The only thing I know is that I don't know anything."" If someone wants to believe something, then they'll find a way to justify their belief. If we could rationally convince people of the existence of God, then He wouldn't be God but rather a man-made idea. God is beyond our mere rationality. If we could deduce God logically, then there would be no need for faith. People believe what they believe not because it is rationally and logically true beyond a doubt, but because it is useful and convenient. Instead of trying to convince people that we're right, we should just develop our own young earth Biology and Physics that is just as useful as the current old earth Biology and Physics. We can teach both models, since both models are equally effective at making accurate predictions, and let people decide what they want to believe. I think this would be the best approach we can take.

The profs argument was long and complex, but compelling, and he offered an alternate definition of species which he admitted had its own flaws. (I can't remember his alternate)

The author is an agnostic apostate who accepts the current secular scientific ideas of universal origins. To his credit, Numbers makes his biases known in the intro and they rarely impact his narrative, so overall it is unbiased enough to get a clear view of the history presented. It is a pretty good history and provides starting point for a deeper dive into a lot of Christian creation views from the past 100 years. As a Christian, it also showed how Christian infighting is very destructive to the faith. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Creation debate. ",1504653868,2,2017-09-05 19:24:28
359,Proof of God - the 1st seal,0,True,"*I'm presenting this topic in this forum because I would like for this to be treated as a discussion and not a debate. I do welcome scrutiny, truth can and should be proven. I would also like for us to be able to discuss the implications of this, the effects, and the possibilities of what this could mean. While I will be approaching this topic from an Abrahamic perspective, utilizing the language of religion as a mode of communication, I am not promoting or condoning any one religion over another. This topic isn't about religion, even if it does affect theology and religious perspectives. This topic is about something greater than religion. This topic is about God, the creator.*


**God is the energy that creates all things.**

 * [Isaiah 45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045)  I am the Lord, and there is no other;
apart from me there is no God. I am the Lord, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things.

 * [Ephesians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4&amp;version=NIV) - one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.

 * [Colossians 1:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1&amp;version=NIV) ""He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

 * [Romans 11:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11&amp;version=NIV) ""For from him and through him and for him are all things. To God be the glory forever! Amen.""

God is the only thing that exists. There is none but God. When God created existence, God created creation out of God. Now we understand more about our universe and the nature that creates it, we can go back with fresh awareness to understand what these verses mean. Let me explain:

Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only transferred. [1st law of thermodynamics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) If it can't be created, it has no beginning. If it can't be destroyed, it has no end. Thus, energy is eternal. 

The Lord is the everlasting God.

In understanding the atom and quantum physics we realize that [everything is made of/by/with energy.](https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/energy/intro.html) In quantum physics this is called [""fields.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) Nothing exists but energy. From the largest object of matter to the smallest subatomic part of a particle, everything is comprised of energy and only energy. 

The laws of energy and the laws of motion create balance and order. It is from these laws that all things are shaped and formed into the reality we exist in today. 

You have heard it said that ""God is within you"" and ""God is within all things.""  This is what that means. God is not outside of the universe. God is not separate from the universe. A hand does not come down from the sky and pull a tree out of the ground to make it grow. The tree grows from within. God is not far away out of reach to His children. God is here. God is within you and you are in God.

367,The philosophy of Rick and Morty,11,True,"It was pointed out to me the other day that 
&gt;This is a place for proponents of creation and intelligent design to discuss ... philosophy as [it] relates to those worldviews.

I was sorta keeping this under my hat, but since I just realized that this venue is explicitly for this sort of thing:

Before we get into Rick and Morty, here's a recap of the basic Christian creation premise

&gt;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

Creationists believe in special creation whereby Man alone among created things is an ""image bearer"" of God.  This is not a trait that is passed on genetically.  It cannot be evolved [into].

The first and most obvious conclusion that falls out of this (to me at least) is that if special creation is true, then we have a justification for behaving as though individual humans are more valuable than the sum of their parts.  If false then we are biological machines.  Nothing more.

How does this display itself mechanistically in the animal kingdom?

Beauty.

We have mostly lost the implications of this word through time, but if you go back to the ECF's (and later) you will see it.

We value stuff beyond the bare utility of that stuff.  We are unique in that regard.  Only humans create, and value beauty (""beauty"" when classically defined).

You may find that beavers build dams, or birds build nests.  They could be said to create something.  But what they create is utilitarian.  If they create they don't create beauty.  

Alternatively, you may hear an anecdote of a crow that likes to steal shiny things.  You might argue that the crow values ""beauty""  But the crow does not create.

Only a man will pay a million dollars for a painting.  Only a man will pay 300k for a car.  This man doesn't steal it like a crow, or only put ""work"" into earning it for its utility like the beaver.  Only a man arbitrarily ascribes value to, and then pays the price he ascribed to a thing for its beauty.

This dovetails with the message of the atonement in Christianity.  We, as humans are not valuable because we are useful.  Our value comes from the otherwise arbitrarily high price Jesus was willing to pay to redeem us.  That is, His blood.  Otherwise we are just meatbags; worth nothing more than a bag of meat.

For those that are not already Christians, that will sound like nonsense.  I know.  Maybe this more human event will bring it home a little.

I have a friend.  Bhuddist, physicist, born in a somewhat impoverished country, moved to the US because if his intelligence and education.  He was working on developing optics in satellites.  Functionally he was a naturalist.  But Buddhism dovetails with naturalism just fine.  They are both pantheistic.  It's just that one sprinkles in the anthropic principle.  Oh, and his wife was Christian.

He is there for the birth of his first child.  Day one.  Still in the delivery room.  He holds his little baby for the first time.  He has a lightbulb moment then and there.  He becomes a Christian.

What's going on under the hood?  If naturalism is true then he is holding a little meatbag.  He may have been evolutionarily conditioned to value this meatbag because that value functions to preserve the species.  But where does his mind go?  ""No.  Don't tell me I value this child because it ultimately benefits me.  This child has actual eternal value.""

Ok, finally on to Rick and Morty.  
If you don't know, the show is pretty crude.  The main guy that makes it is pretty intelligent, and he's an atheist.  I don't mean like a sort of blase, agnostic.  I mean a consciously, volitional atheist.  It's fun to watch because you see that tension come out in the show all the time.

Basically, if Atheism is true then Nihilism is also true.  The paradox is that if anybody actually behaves as though Nihilism were actually true then they would commit suicide because suffering is universal.  Since not every Atheist commits suicide, we have to ask then: ""What is your motivation?""  We see this question asked all.the.time in Rick and Morty.  It never presents any useful answers, but for whatever reason I like to watch the writers struggle with it.


[spoilers for s3e6]

In that episode, Rick's entire persona split into two avatars.  One was all the character traits that Rick thinks are healthy about himself.  The other avatar was comprised of all the character traits that Rick thinks are toxic about himself.

Then the thing that was supposed to be the big twist at the end [again, spoilers]  Toxic Rick valued Morty as a person.  Healthy Rick did not care if Morty lived or died.

The episode took for granted that there is no absolute morality.  This is demonstrated when the personality separating machine (from earlier in the episode) did not split the avatars based on some absolute standard of what is, and is not toxic.  It just operated based on what you thought was, and was not toxic *for you*.

I'm not claiming that any of the writers actually behave as though individuals in their own lives do not have absolute, eternal value when it comes to their close friends of family.  But the naturalist can't actually justify that behavior.  They will actually go to lengths to deny it in a debate context, and then go home to their wife and kids and behave the opposite.  I think most people don't actually think about the paradox much, if at all.  But these writers obviously do.  If you can stomach the crudeness, that is.

So, yeah, I welcome comments or thoughts.  I just felt like this sub has been getting off track with so much minutiae.  I actually just wanted to get back to the roots and toss something like this out there to see how people respond to the basics.

**edit  Should add that toxic Rick didn't value Morty as having eternal absolute value.  Toxic Rick was actually just codependent.  There was no side of Rick that operated as though people have eternal, absolute value.",1504067732,54,2017-08-30 00:35:32

391,Supposed Comparative Embryology,4,True,"When I was an atheist evolutionist, I used comparative embryology in almost every debate I had because evolution predicts that if we all evolved then all embryos should look alike since we all had a common ancestor. Soon enough I realized that it was a wrong technique to use. The whole idea came from a dishonest scientist called Haeckel who made up a hoax diagram similar to [this](https://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/56/102/92821651_XS.jpg&imgrefurl=http://classroom.synonym.com/comparative-embryology-13269.html&h=400&w=261&tbnid=q15MDb7JKddxTM:&tbnh=160&tbnw=104&usg=__DpIFnloalVfug_6SdttKHF6shW0=&vet=10ahUKEwiS-o7amc3VAhXLiFQKHcyhCkIQ9QEILTAA..i&docid=r2DIvnc5mPWJEM&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS-o7amc3VAhXLiFQKHcyhCkIQ9QEILTAA)

However, science now realizes that Haeckel's drawings are fraud and are not proven. Modern scientists at university of Chicago now are using modern technology to see what embryos look like and they [concluded](http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Haeckel--fraud%20not%20proven.pdf) that Haeckel's drawings that supposedly prove evolution, are fraud, false and are not even close to true and thus are not evidence for evolution although they do applaude haeckel's attempt.

Embryos actually look something like the second row [here](http://creation.com/images/journal_of_creation/vol25/9064-fig4.jpg). Second row is what they actually look like according to university of Chicago professors, first row is what Haeckel thought they looked like. 

In fact, embryos throughout their cycle look very very different from one [another.](http://www.ichthus.info/Evolution/PICS/Richardson-embryos.jpg)  The sonar pictures of embryos that modern science took contradicts the pencil drawings that Haeckel's imagination produced.

So in conclusion, the ""evidence"" for comparative embryology that evolutionists use is based on the outdated imagination of a German philosopher named Haeckel and modern science and scientists at the university of Chicago using modern technology have concluded diagrams that obliterate the old imaginations of Haeckel which destroy the claim that comparative embryology proves evolution or all embryos look similar so evolution. You can even go as far as saying that the uniqueness of each and every one of those embryos shows special design and reaffirms creationism although I think it is a bit of a stretch.

Edit 1: I am not denying that comparative embryology or the study of embryology is not a real thing. It is. It just does not prove evolution as evolutionists claim. 

Edit 2 : Fun fact -- Upon the discovery of the scientific community that Haeckel's drawings are based on his imagination rather than any evidence, he was barred from many [scientific circles](https://www.icr.org/article/1068).",1502387359,37,2017-08-10 13:49:19
393,Teaching people that evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive is irresponsible.,0,True,"Hello all! Hope you are well. As I've been browsing through comments and various topics in this great sub I'm noting a lot of people who are under the impression that the concept of evolution and the concept of intelligent design are mutually exclusive, that you can't be one if you are the other. This is extremely irresponsible and does a huge disservice to explaining what intelligent design is all about.

Darwin made a point to explain that his work ""Origin of the Species"" is not making a commentary on the origin of life. Even if evolution were true, that notion does not negate intelligent design. When you teach that the two concepts are competing, you will ultimately be leading people away from God as they grow to learn the facts about evolution. 

The evidence is overwhelming that evolution is on some level a fact of nature. When credible evidence becomes so undeniable, people will begin to believe it as truth. If these same people are under the impression that the two concepts are competing, they will ultimately choose what they believe to be true.  

Genesis does not say we did not evolve. In fact, it states that God created us out of clay. This is the same thing evolution is saying, that we evolved from carbon, water, and energy. That we evolved out of clay. This fact, for one, is one of the reasons I am a believer in intelligent design. ",1502320790,94,2017-08-09 19:19:50

402,"How the secular world view can poison science, part 2: Hubble's Horror...",7,True,"While Galileo and Copernicus discovered that we are not at the center of the solar system, it seems that we may be at the center of the universe.  I'm sure this is not news to many on this sub, but I was amazed to discover it recently.

Edwin Hubble, upon observing that the surrounding galaxies were moving away from us in every direction, realized the very natural interpretation of this data: we are at the center of the observable universe.

But this conclusion horrified him.  The following quotes are from his book, *The Observational Approach to Cosmology*:

“Such a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth. **The hypothesis cannot be disproved but it is unwelcome** and would be accepted only as a last resort.”

""The unwelcome supposition of a favoured location **must be avoided at all costs**.”
 
“Such a favoured position, of course, is intolerable; moreover, it represents a discrepancy with the theory, because the theory postulates homogeneity. **Therefore, in order to restore homogeneity, and to escape the horror of a unique position…**”

Now I do not know of any place in the Bible which claims we are spatially at the center of the universe, and there is nothing intrinsically true about the proposition: “To be spatially at the center of something makes one special,” but these facts are beside the point.  It would be pretty difficult to divorce the idea that we are at the center of the universe from the idea that we are a special creation of God.  As a consequence of this, Hubble was horrified, and sought desperately to escape this most natural interpretation of his data. 

 
Decades later, Stephen Hawking writes, “Now at first sight, all this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe. There is, however, an alternate explanation: the universe might look the same in every direction as seen from any other galaxy too. This, as we have seen, was Friedmann’s second assumption. **We have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption**.  We believe it only on grounds of modesty.""


Notice that there is no lying here, no hiding of facts, no organized conspiracy to oppose a theistic world-view.   And yet, are we taught in school that we are at the center of the universe?

The Germans have a term, *Zeitgeist*, which means ""Spirit of the Age""; it refers to “the defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time.”  This mood is always difficult to resist, and our own *Zeitgeist* is shaped by influential people like Hubble.  The effect is obvious.  If the spirit of the age is to escape conclusions which imply we are the special creatures of God, then those ideas that conform to that spirit will prevail without conspiracy or lying or overt deception. 

And they will pass themselves off as objective science.

407,Pinpoint Navigation and Propulsion in a Seemingly Random Soup,8,True,"DNA isn't used solely as blue prints for proteins, it has multiple roles including providing a means of propulsion and navigation for molecular messengers:

https://crev.info/2017/08/pinpoint-navigation-propulsion-seemingly-random-soup/

>Think of the difficulty of sending a package from one location to another when there are a billion possible destinations. To make this process efficient it requires infrastructure and machines that can propel themselves and navigate. It’s even more amazing if this happens in an ever changing soup of molecules within a cell.

>In 2007, John Rinn discovered a lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) molecule copied from DNA on human Chromosome 12 would somehow navigate and land to a specific location on human Chromosome 2 by riding a molecular “bus” known as the Suz12 protein. This ritual was crucial for delivering molecular signals so that the skin cells at the sole of the foot would have different qualities than skin cells at the lid of the eye.

>Amazingly, Rinn began his research suspecting all he would come up with was “hotair” rather than a real discovery. He thus named this amazing RNA molecule HOTAIR. When his research was published, the journal editors hailed it as the greatest article in their history, but the name HOTAIR was retained.

>How this feat of navigation by and propulsion by the SUZ12 protein that shuttles the HOTAIR lncRNA from a specific location on Chromosome 12 to a specific location on Chromosome 2 could be accomplished in a seemingly random soup of chemicals boggles the mind. After all, there are over a billion locations in the nucleus to park HOTAIR on a particular stretch of DNA, not to mention that DNA is a moving target!

>What Rinn’s research demonstrated is that many parts of DNA formerly thought to be junk could serve as navigational markers, like street signs as well as highways that allow molecules to sail the winds of Brownian motion and deliver molecular packages with pin-point accuracy.

>The hypothesis that DNA serves multiple roles is furthered by a recent related development regarding proteins known as transcription factors. According to  Phys.org, “Rattling DNA hustles transcribers to targets” –
>>New simulations of DNA as a transport conduit could shatter the way scientists have thought about how large molecules called transcription factors diffuse on their way to carry out genetic missions, according to a study by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The simulations add important brush strokes to our picture of elusive inner mechanics of cells.

>>The simulations strongly support the hypothesis that, in a live cell, DNA is in constant motion, making it the dominant mover of transcription factors, to their target sites on DNA. There, the factors regulate the transcription of genetic code into life-sustaining action.

https://phys.org/news/2017-06-rattling-dna-hustles_1.html

>It intuitively suggests a very well conceived system of highways and shuttles where DNA plays a role. We tend to think of DNA as a solely a blueprint, but DNA could also serve multiple roles as a means of navigation and propulsion!

....

>It’s certainly possible, in fact increasingly believable, much of the so-called junk DNA in humans is part of an elaborate 3-dimensional structure necessary for shuttling molecules to and fro. If so, then we are indeed fearfully and wonderfully made rather than the piles of junk Darwinists would prefer to have us believe.


The NIH ENCODE project has sister projects like 4D NUCLEOME which explores the cell-specific 3D architecture of DNA:
http://crev.info/2017/04/the-4d-nucleome-project-helps-creationist-research/

>Here we tell about the 4D Nucleome and ENCODE project and the billions of dollars God is sending to help creationist research through the NIH’s unwitting funding programs.

>Hermann Muller won the Nobel Prize for his study of human mutations and birth defects.  A consequence of Muller’s theories imply that only 2% of the human genome could be functional under the assumptions of evolutionary theory.  Many evolutionary theorists have therefore insisted that around 98% of the human genome must be junk as a matter of principle.  A wonderful exploration of Muller’s work is outlined in the book Genetic Entropy by John Sanford, a world famous genetic engineer at Cornell who eventually rejected evolutionary theory.

>DNA provides more than just mere blueprints for proteins.

>In 2012,  some 200 researchers who were part of the 300 million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) ENCODE project declared 80% of the human genome is functional, far beyond the limit evolutionary theory said was possible. ENCODE’s proclamation drew the fury of evolutionary biologists like Dan Graur who called the ENCODE researchers “crooks” and “ignoramuses”  promoting an “evolution free gospel”. Graur referred to the data generated by ENCODE laboratories as “piles of excrement” and called  one of ENCODE’s chief architects, Ewan Birney, “the scientific equivalent of Saddam Hussein.”

>The ENCODE project resulted in even more NIH projects like the 300 million dollar RoadmapEpigenomics project and other projects like psychENCODE and the 205 million dollar E4 Epistranscriptomic project as well as smaller projects like psychENCODE and 4D nucleome.  Added to this are the billions to be spent by pharmaceutical companies to explore the glycome, the set of sugar molecules used by organisms, and many other “-omes” beside the genome.

>In 2014,  the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the 4D Nucleome project which explores the 4-dimensional architecture of DNA. DNA is erroneously thought by many, especially evolutionary biologists, to function solely as blueprints for proteins. But DNA provides more than just mere blueprints for proteins. DNA serves as a 3-dimensional parking lot for all sorts of molecular machines involved in helping manage construction of a cell. These parking lots are constructed and reconfigured differently from cell to cell and even during various phases of the cell.  Since the configuration of the parking lot changes over time, this adds a 4th dimension to DNA which heretofore was underappreciated.

>The 4D nucleome project is showing that we are only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg of God’s fearfully and wonderfully made designs. For a time it seemed that creationists had no money to explore God’s creation and prove evolution wrong. But God is on the side of creationists and He is ensuring billions in public and private funds are devoted to prove that “ENCODE is right and evolution is wrong”.

412,A Fallen History: How a Literal Genesis Can Coexist with the Observations and Evidence of an Old Universe and Evolution,2,True,"So, there has always been this struggle in me as long as I have been contemplating the debate between Young Earth Creationists and Old Earth Creationists and Secular Science.  Now, because of my convictions regarding the Bible and its truth, I think that the Genesis account had to be literal; it seems very much to be how Jesus understood it, and I refuse to think that Jesus was flat wrong about this, but I do think it is possible that the details of it may not have always been clearly explained because there was no need for it.  Just as there is no concept of dating in the Bible yet we adapt biblical teachings to apply to dating, I think there is a way to explain why science has produced the results it has in regard to what it observes and claims is history without writing it off as lying, unsaved sinner’s/secular bias, or just getting things wrong.  I think that it is highly unlikely that the scientific community, as secular as it might be, would actually get away with holding on to its biases in what it observes (especially since there are Christians in relevant fields that would probably prefer it if things worked out in a consistent way); I doubt that this would ever happen.  If it could, then scientists wouldn’t have changed their views on the idea that the universe is eternal in favor of a universe with a beginning (which evidential apologists now use as further evidence of God in creation:  natural revelation).  I also personally find it useless to keep trying to make what scientists find fit in with the Genesis narrative in ways where we have to handle each and every piece of evidence.

I end up stuck with this dilemma:  I don’t think that scientists have been wrong about what they are observing in a super significant way that would cause us to have to abandon modern science’s discoveries and scientific theories, and I think that the Genesis account is literal.

How do the two fit together then?

A couple of passages lead to the idea that the entirety of creation was affected in the Fall of Man, not just mankind.

>And to Adam he said, ""Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.  By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."" (Genesis 3:17-19 ESV)

>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.  For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.  And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.  (Romans 8:20-23 ESV)

Note that these passages talk of the decay of Creation, and if Creation did fall due to sin, is it not subject to the ruling of a rebellious Satan and sin (to the extent that anything can be, considering the sovereignty of God)?  If Satan and sin have this decaying effect on Creation, then it is very possible that they are the reasons we see what we see today in regard to evolution happening and the universe being old and everything seemingly working without a God; rebellious creatures and sin seem to be very good at making it seem as if things can operate without God, though it is foolish, false, and a lie.  This makes me think that what secular science discovers about a lot of things is just what it is discovering about a false history created by the corruption of sin in the world; it pretty much accurately describes what is observed, but that doesn’t mean that it is true.  What truly happened is what we have in Genesis, but when sin entered the world, everything was quickly corrupted into this state.

I also kind of think it is very possible that this process may have been sped up by the Flood waters (which were a miracle rather than trying to explain where all of this water came from and went somehow), and when the waters (which covered the whole of the Earth) receded, there was a world that had more animals than before because of this illusory evolution that all of the animals from Creation prior to the Flood now fit into so that the world could appear as if it was working without God (which would also explain how all of the animals fit on the Ark:  there were simply fewer animals).  There was obviously plant life when the waters receded, which would only be possible if by a miracle because that much water would kill everything, so I don’t see why there couldn’t have been more animals too (solving the common Kangaroo problem).

Now, natural revelation still exists.  Creation still attests to the authorship and glory of God despite the corruption just as unsaved people do because they have the image of God.  I’m not saying that the image of God is in all of creation, but sin can never corrupt something to the point of being unrecognizable as God’s creation.  I also think that the New Heaven and the New Earth will come when the enemies of Jesus have been put under His feet (the last of which would be the very actors in the corruption of the world), and the New Heaven and New Earth will look like God originally created the world prior to the Fall without the Fall happening.

I don’t think this sort of view renders science useless though.  We live in a fallen world, but we have to live in a fallen world.  Learning about our fallen world seems to be the best way to learn to live in it.

This is just kind of a rough idea of mine that isn’t fully formed (that I think I am going to refer to as Fallen History Creationism or FHC for short, though I am not sure how useful of a name it is because it is ultimately a subset of Young Earth Creationism), but I thought I’d present it anyway.  I'd love to hear thoughts, corrections, etc.",1501709099,7,2017-08-02 17:24:59

420,"How the secular world view can poison science, part 1: That Neil deGrasse Tyson quote...",20,True,"We, as creationists, often stress the fact that data need interpreting.  One can usually explain data coherently from a variety of viewpoints.  

But the great delusion of modern culture is that the (current) orthodox scientific option on a subject is the only explanation and, therefore, is synonymous with truth.  *This faith in the modern paradigm hinders the progress of science.*  Even a well-trained scientist like [Neil deGrasse Tyson is capable of falling into this regrettable mistake when he says in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxx8pen6JY)  “The good thing about science is that it is true whether or not you believe in it.”  

Thankfully, Copernicus and Galileo did not think this way.  The received scientific opinion in their day was that the earth was the center of the universe.  This idea was supported by data and the authority of the scientific community.  No doubt the common opinion was that this idea was unshakably true, but Copernicus and Galileo destroyed it.  They did not tweak it.  They did not modify it.  They completely undermined it with good science and the courage to think for themselves.  

The geocentric conception of the universe was two thousand years old when it died.

Evolution (which Tyson endorses with his flippant remark about science) is not yet two hundred old.

421,"YEC here, and I have a question!",7,True,"I'll cut to the chase. Could LIFE on earth only be 6000 years old but the earth/universe be older? Could matter, elements, light and laws of physics be older than 6000 years and God created life and placed it on earth just 6000 years ago?

That's the question I have but I'd like to explain my thoughts. We can observe some things that are difficult to explain as YEC but from what I've seen they almost never have to do with life. For example light from distant stars reaching earth. Could it be that before life was created the universe was in motion for an undefined amount of time? Was time even a thing? I know there is some evidence suggesting that time is effected by observation. How would an unobserved universe (aside from God) act? Could things have been moving at a mind boggling pace until life was placed in the universe but still obeying the 7 day creation?

Sorry for the ramble, I really should be sleeping right now! :P

Edit: I think I may have not been clear on one point. Is time measured by the movement of matter or vice versa? Or could it be that the 2 move along completely separate from one another. If the later is the case, then could matter have moved extremely quickly for the first days of creation before life was placed in the universe?",1501230149,29,2017-07-28 04:22:29

440,Gaming has come a long way [and this front-page r/gaming post makes a decent analogy showing that our genome is a program],14,True,"https://m.imgur.com/k1pCRKr?r

This simple graphic's headline states, ""The entire Super Mario Bros. game was 40 kilobytes. This image is 349 kilobytes."" All that the image contains is a single screen shot from the game and a few lines of colored text. Seems counter intuitive at the surface but it actually makes perfect sense.

The game Mario Bros., and pretty much any video game for that matter, is actually a program written to generate continuous, interactive visual environments. In other words, these programs are not a continuous series of prepared still images - as the image shows that is extremely inefficient (and practically impossible to make work). Instead, lines of code running through digital hardware are continuously drawing and updating the image as you interact with the game.

We humans are similar in many ways. If you took a fully functional 3-D still image of yourself in your present state it would be an enormous amount of data. There are over 200 different types of cells in the human body, and the average human male is made up of 30 trillion of those cells. Inside of those cells and throughout various non-cellular structures there are thousands of chemical compounds (presumably, I couldn't find a reference.) 

In other words, if we used cells as analogies to pixels, a 10 megapixel image would be a pin head compared to the exponentially larger 3-D cellular image of a human (minimum 30 terapixel, right?). If you add in the various chemical compounds in your system and the electrical charges in your nervous system it gets downright ridiculous.

In terms of data that would be analogous to Mario's 40 kilobytes, most estimates of a human genome's data size put it at around a gigabyte or less. Doesn't matter at that scale because even if it were 10 gigabytes the relative ratio would still be staggering. If the Mario image is 40:349 a 10 gigabyte human would still be 10:100000+ (presumably something just astronomical).

There are other, major aspects of this analogy that work quite well. The Mario cartridge can't do anything without the Nintendo just as our DNA is useless without the cellular machinary to replicate and ""run"" the code. Also, the Nintendo was designed to process the code in a specific way, a coding language was written, etc. I've seen arguments that ask the question, why does a particular DNA sequence code for a specific amino acid? 

This wound up fairly long so I hope someone enjoys reading. This was a spontaneous effort on seeing the Mario image. The general concept, however, is something I think of often. In my mind, it's blatantly obvious that our genome is made up of extremely well written code. A relatively tiny amount of data builds a complex human from an single embryo. No man made technology is even close to that complexity. People fantasize about futuristic nano machines but we're right here, we're already made of them.

I believe the idea of junk DNA, being so persistent, will one day be a monument to the utter failure of evolutionary thinking. There has never been a greater road block to the progress of science.

443,Some questions about Young Earth Creationism,11,True,"Hello everyone!

So a while back I made this post on r/Christianity and earlier today I also made it on r/TrueChristian. Please note that the quote is a copy and paste from the original post I made, and was directed to an audience where there were Christians that were both YEC's and Christians that believes in the Big Bang, so please ignore the bit that is crossed out. I won't take it out, to ensure it is as accurate to the original post as possible though.

>So this question has been bugging me for a while. How do young earth creationists respond to scientific evidence? ~~If you are not a YEC and are posting here, try to adopt the mindset of one so I can see how they would respond.~~

>Topics to focus on (although feel free to include your own!)

>The Big Bang

>Evolution/Natural Selection

>Carbon dating and other dating methods

>Whether Genesis is literal or metaphorical to you

I acknowledge the fact that there is a god, and that he created everything somehow, but I am conflicted on HOW he created it.

I would appreciate it if you could help answer some of my questions regarding this topic?

Is the story of Creation literal or metaphorical?

If it is literal, is there any worldly evidence for YECism (I.e. scientific evidence etc.)

How do YEC's respond to stuff like carbon dating, or evidence for the big bang and evolution over thousands or millions of years?

How important is this topic to salvation? If I believe the wrong creation story, will I go to hell?

Please don't mistake this for me assuming that all creationists are inherently less intelligent or anything. I just currently feel conflicted by the scientific evidence that seems to disprove YECism. This is especially hard for me considering I also aim to enter a STEM field later in life (specifically Chemistry, Pharmacy or Biology, something along the lines of those, although my exact choices are not definite) and I don't want to have this argument conflicting with me my whole life, especially since most scientists reject YECism.

447,Genetic degeneration/entropy,6,True,"In my experience, most creationists are willing to accept some form of species adaptation. 'Micro-evolution' or changes within a 'kind' (species) are some of the popular terms that I have seen used in creationist circles.

Micro-evolution seems pretty much indistinguishable from regular evolution on small time scales. However, the micro-evolutionary perspective lacks a mechanism for adding any additional genetic ""information"" past the point of initial creation. Any beneficial attributes that arise over time are variations on preexisting genetic information. That seems like a degenerative process. Any changes would result in a net loss of genetic material over time if no information can be added without some type of divine/intelligent/creator intervention.

---

My questions for anyone who would generally agree with that characterization of micro-evolution:

* Is there an impending genetic degeneration doomsday sometime in the future (assuming no divine intervention).
* Can we expect all species to degrade at roughly the same rate, or will the more genetically complex/simple organisms fall first?

My question for anyone who would disagree with that characterization of micro-evolution:

Did God design contingencies within His creation before the Fall, add modifications to His creation after the Fall, or did the ecosystem simply adapt itself to the Fall through random, natural processes like evolution?

Edit: When I'm referring to death and suffering, I'm including natural phenomena like predation, pathogenesis, and parasitism. If every animal was originally designed to be a herbivore before the Fall, then how could the ecosystem stabilize itself around a system of animal carnivory? Where did all the defense/attack structures (e.g. venom, fangs, claws, talons, stingers, camouflage, mimicry, quills, thorns, odors) come from? These structures seem highly unlikely to have arisen spontaneously as a direct result of the Fall unless God Himself engineered such structures to  emerge after the Fall. Otherwise, if the Fall was meant to incur death and suffering, then where did all the defense mechanisms of every prey come from? If any defense/attack structures existed before the Fall, what was their original purpose? Which structures only emerged after the Fall? What were all the pathogenic microorganisms, decomposers, parasites, and viruses doing before the Fall?

I made the claim that there are more than 3000 entries in the Uniprot database for nylonases.  I've said ""nylonase"" is a bit of a misnomer, because nylonases don't actually digest a fully formed nylon but rather a waste products or intermediates of the nylon manufacturing process, namely dimer and oligomer 6-aminohexanoates.  The authors of the nylonase paper use the word ""nylon"" rather loosely, but when the actual chemical is identified that the nylonase breaks down, it is rather a nylon intermediate or waste product, not a full blown nylon.

[I occasionally remove GuyInAChair from my block list to address what may sound like a persuasive counter argument.]

GuyInAChair said in response to some of my claims:
>To be blunt this is a blatant lie. I call it a lie, not because it's simply factually incorrect, but because he's been corrected on this point several times and still insists on making the same false statement. The Tl;Dr is Sal is doing a search by name, not by genetic sequence, and not by chemical function. 

>Since of the 3000 examples he claims exist, not a single one has a 90% sequence identity, using the comparison tool on the website he linked, with nylB hasn't he just made the problem 1000x worse for himself?

>He's getting 3000 matches because of nomenclature, not because there's 3000 similar genes out there. THIS is the chemical NylB breaks down. THIS is 6-aminohexanoate, which is derived from Lysine 

>If you remember your organic chemistry well enough you'll notice the nylon polymer has a 6 carbon structural unit, that looks like it could possibly be made with 6-aminohexanoate. In fact if you go to the the WIKI one sentence there stands out. 


>Aminocaproic acid is also an intermediate in the polymerization of Nylon-6, where it is formed by ring-opening hydrolysis of caprolactam. 

>Which makes sense since the name of NylB is ""6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase"" So ya... he's getting 3000 results not because there's 3000 enzymes that digest nylon. He's getting that many results because he's doing a name search, and the name happens in include a simple, common, 6 carbon molecule. 

Well, well...how about we look to see if Nylonases actually digest nylon or whether they ""digest"" dimers and oligomers of 6-aminohexanotes!

From one of the original papers on the so-called ""Nylonases"":

http://www.pnas.org/content/81/8/2421.short

>Waste water from nylon factories contains E-caprolkctum, 6-
aminohexanoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer,
and 6-aminohexanoic acid oligomers. In spite of the fact that
nylon synthesis began only several decades ago, it was
found, as early as 1975, that Flavobacterium Sp. KI72 could
grow in a culture medium containing 6-aminohexanoic acid
cyclic dimer as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, as
quoted in ref. 2. Soon, two enzymes responsible for this metabolism of 6-aminohexanoic cyclic dimer were identified as
6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer hydrolase (6-AHA CDH)
and 6-AHA LOH (2, 3).

So what does Nylb actually ""digest""?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-aminohexanoate-dimer_hydrolase

And from the 1977 paper by Kinoshita:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1977.tb11904.x/abstract

>6-Aminohexanoic Acid Cyclic Dimer Hydrolase.
A New Cyclic Amide Hydrolase Produced
by Acromobacter guttatus KI 72
....
Achromobacter guttatus KI72, able to grow on a
medium containing 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer
as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen [5], was
used throughout this study. The basal medium contained
1 % 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer, 0.3 :d
and 0.05 % yeast extract and was adjusted to pH 6.4.
The seed culture was prepared by inoculating a loopful
of bacterial cells from a slant culture into 100 ml
of the basal medium in a 500-ml conical flasks, and
was incubated on a rotary shaker at 30 ""C for 2 days.
An aliquot (10 ml) of the seed culture was transferred
to 11 of the fresh basal medium in a 3-1 Sakaguchi
flask and this was incubated on a reciprocal shaker
at the same temperature for 24 h. The culture was filtered
through filter paper to remove the residual insoluble
6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer, and the
cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed
twice with 0.02 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3,
containing 10 % glycerol (buffer A).


Ahem, so where again is the molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digested?  The molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digest is:

https://biocyc.org/compound?orgid=META&id=CPD-3923

Does the molecule GuyInAChair claims is digested by NylB the molecule that NylB actually digests in the papers that reported on NylB?

So let's just settle this with facts rather than accusations of blatant lying on my part.  If I made a mistake, I made a mistake, and I'd rather retract a mistake than mislead my fellow creationists.

GuyInAChair is invited now to cite in the literature where NylB actually ""digests"" the molecule he claims it digests.

>Since of the 3000 examples he claims exist, not a single one has a 90% sequence identity,

False, A-NylB in Agromyces and NylB in Flavobacteria have 99% sequence similarity and they will come up in the search on 6-aminohexanoate hydrolases Uniprot.  Same is true of A-NylC and NylC.   Apparently GuyInAChair is overlooking some facts.

ADDENDUM:
GuyInAChair claims Nylon-6 is what is digested by NylB, from wiki:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon_6

the formula for a Nylon-6 monomer is:  C6 H11  NO

In contrast 6-aminohexanoic acid (which what was actually digested) has the formula:  C6 H13 N02

See: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6-aminohexanoic_acid

CLEARLY the formula for Nylon-6 and 6-aminohexanoic acid are not the same, and NylB is listed as digesting 6-aminohexanoic acid, not Nylon-6 (as GuyInAChair) claims.

GuyInAChair is thus challenged to explain why he said Nylon-6 was digested by NylB.   I should add, from the 1977 paper 
>the enzyme has evolved by adaptation to a new synthetic substance which is a **waste product** of nylon-6 production

So the enzyme doesn't digest nylon-6 but rather a waste product of its production.  Yet I'm still accused of lying.  GuyInAChair is welcome to offer a scientific counter to what I have presented.

477,Creationists and IDists stand up for rights of Evolutionary Biologist Bret Weinstein,13,True,"For all the trash talking of the creationists here and elsewhere at the hands of Darwinists, many of us around the net like ID proponent Mike Gene and creationists like myself have stood up for the rights of Evolutionary Biologist Bret Weinstein. 

If Darwinists think creationists are anti progress,  have them look at what is happening at EverGreen State  University to evolutionary biologists like Bret Weinstein:

https://shadowtolight.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/new-video-on-evergreen-state-crackpots-and-snowflakes/

Seeing this has motivated me even more to offer affordable (albeit unacredited) college level courses in basic science online than what an $88,000 ""accredited"" BS degree in some of the junk offered at Ever Green State.

Elite scholar Jordan Peterson predicted what is happening at EverGreen State is the consequence of a culture that has rejected their Creator God.

Many of the creationists here have a greater appreciation of the gift of science that God has provided than many at EverGreen State University.

For example, look at the description of one of the biology courses there:

http://evergreen.edu/catalog/offering/feminist-epistemologies-critical-approaches-biology-and-psychology-14272

>The history of women’s intellectual production and thought has long been silenced or suppressed by patriarchal structures, and to a great extent continues today through institutionalized sexism, androcentrism, and heteronormativity. This program will provide an opportunity for upper-level students familiar with mainstream methodologies within the natural sciences who wish to examine feminist critiques of such epistemologies and engage in research through a critical lens.

>We will read feminist philosophy of science, sociological studies on science and how it operates in society, research on women scientists, and critical deconstructions of sociobiology and the related field of evolutionary psychology. Possible topics to be examined through feminist lenses are developmental biology, fertilization, reproduction, sex determination, sexuality, and gendered social norms. Possible authors include Emily Martin, Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding, Donna Haraway, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Stacy Alaimo, Cordelia Fine, Marlene Zuk and Karen Barad. 


Note the author recommended for study in this ""biology"" class: Sandra Harding!!!  Here is a sample of Sandra Harding

http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/know-thy-enemy-newtons-rape-manual.php
>But if we are to believe that mechanistic metaphors were a fundamental component of the explanations the new science provided, why should we believe that the gender metaphors were not? A consistent analysis would lead to the conclusion that understanding nature as a woman indifferent to or even welcoming rape was equally fundamental to the interpretations of these new conceptions of nature and inquiry. Presumably these metaphors, too, had fruitful pragmatic, methodological, and metaphysical consequences for science. In that case, **why is it not as illuminating and honest to refer to Newton's laws as ""Newton's rape manual"" as it is to call them ""Newton's mechanics""?**


That is the intellectual wasteland that universities are becoming and why creationists will increasingly be defenders of true science.

And by the way, it is not just Darwinism that threatens the progress of creationism, it is the Neo-Marxist, anti-God, post-modern movement that is on display at EverGreen State that only pretends to champion ""social justice"" but is fundamentally an anti-truth movement.

487,A personal theoreticall explanation for the Fermi Paradox based on the Christian God being the Intelligant Designer,2,True,"There's a lot of personal ideology and experiences behind this theory so I'm not gonna get into that and will instead keep it short and simple. 

If you're not already aware of what the Fermi paradox is, it's a paradox that says if the Universe is 13.7 billion years old (or whatever number they say) and life on Earth only took a few hundred million years to evolve, then why don't we see aliens zipping around the universe already? This video by Kurzgesagt lays it out very eloquently: https://youtu.be/sNhhvQGsMEc

Now, assuming that is was not evolution and billions of years, but instead Creation by an Intelligent Designer(also going with YEC history here), there are (as far as I can see) two possible explanations. 

Whether or not macroevolution is possible or not, the universe being something between 6000 and 10000 years old is simply not enough time to allow that. That means that God either created only us and that is all anyone in our lifetime will find, or my second explanation: 

God did, and they are only maybe as advanced as us, or in their own early space age, or earlier. We know earth like planets are not rare (see TRAPPIST-1), and from my point of view as a young person trying to understand Gods motivations, it only makes sense to populate the Galaxies with other sentient life. Now, In Genesis 1:27 it says “So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them..."" However, we also see that the full image of God is deadly to humans (see Exodus 33:20). I would argue that we as humans are only merely a *part* of the image God. What is to say he didn't create other sentient life, that could also be in the image of God, on other planets, maybe nearby, maybe in distant galaxies. 

Just some 'headcanon' (for lack of a better word) to explain the Fermi Paradox from a YEC, ID perspective. I've asked some friends what they think of this and gotten very mixed answers, so I'm curious what you all think?",1496901573,12,2017-06-08 01:59:33
489,"Some thoughts on whether or not evolution is falsifiable, part 2: Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils...",9,True,"Here is another way evolution might be falsified: If it can be demonstrated that life has not been on earth long enough for evolution to have taken place, evolution is false.


Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils thought to be sixty-five million years old is evidence supporting the idea that we have been grossly overestimating (by at least tens of millions of years) the age of life on earth.  If we have been grossly overestimating the age of life on earth, then evolution might be false.


When Mary Schweitzer discovered soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, she and the scientific community were astonished.  This astonishment is often denied now by evolutionists I have spoken with.  Do not be mislead.  Those scientists who discovered the soft tissue in these fossils were so astonished that they found it incredible at first.  [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJAO68Bk8PM) starting at around 8:25.  When the lab tech reported her findings, Schweitzer said, “This is not possible.  Do it [the test] again.”  They did it again.  And again. And again.  Seventeen times they did it again before they believed it.  Derek Brigs called her discovery “totally improbable,” at first, and says at 5:20 of the video linked above: “Nobody was imagining that dinosaurs might have had preserved soft tissues.” 


So, soft tissue in dinosaur fossils brings us to a crossroads:
 
Either

1) our scientific understanding of the age of these fossils is seriously flawed,

or

2) our scientific understanding of tissue preservation is seriously flawed.
 
*Since option number two does not threaten the edifice of evolution, evolutionists are opting for number two.*  Option number one is rejected, a priori: Since evolution must be true, option number one must be false.

In attempting to demonstrate the truth of option number two, scientists have performed experiments with tissue preservation under ideal laboratory conditions over the past decade or so.  From their observations, they are concluding that it is reasonable to believe that tissue might be preserved in harsh, real world conditions over sixty-five million years.  In any other setting this sort of unjustified extrapolation would be laughed to scorn in the scientific community:

**Scientist A** (to a room full of colleagues): “Behold, I can lift 10 pounds over my head.  Therefore, since it is only a matter of degree, I can also lift sixty-five million pounds over my head.”

**Scientist B** (from the audience):  “I’m not sure that follows.”

**Scientist A:** “Nonsense.  Here, I’ll do it right now, only first I’ll need you and everyone else to leave the room…”


And Mary Schweitzer’s discovery is not an isolated case.  [This whole interview is great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2phFPZfy4S0) , but at 7:30 Brian Thomas gives a list of other fossils with biomaterial in them, one of which (a sponge) was thought by evolutionists to be **five hundred million years old.**

Once again, we have a claim supporting evolution which cannot be observed, and which relies on an incredibly unjustified degree of extrapolation.  

And once again, we have a potential means of falsifying evolution that is swept under the rug *because it could falsify evolution.*

493,Some thoughts on whether or not evolution is falsifiable...,10,True,"Here is a classic example of a falsifiable claim: All crows are black.  

Notice that this claim can be falsified by a single observation of a white (or any non-black) crow.  This is what it means to be falsifiable. [This video does a good job of summarizing the idea.] 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-sGqBsWv4)

Now, how would this apply to evolution?  

Below is a summary of the evolutionary proposition:
Every living organism has descended from a single ancient cell by the process of natural selection acting on random mutation over the course of billions of years.

This proposition is the theory, and this is not falsifiable.
 
Nestled securely behind the veil of prehistory and fortified by a process that required, ultimately, billions of years to take place, it is both unobservable and unreproducible.  It is, therefore, unfalsifiable by these methods.

The only way to make evolution falsifiable is to advance propositions that *are* falsifiable by observation and which follow necessarily from the truth of evolution or which, if true, make evolution false.  

In my recent conversations on DebateEvolution, I was presented with the following as an example of such a proposition: “If it was shown that there is no basis for the inheritance of traits from one generation to the next, evolution is wrong.” 

I agree that if I could do this, I would prove evolutionary theory false.  The problem is that I cannot do it because I would have to prove that we do not inherit genetic traits from our parents, and we obviously do this.  Rather than challenging me to find a single non-black crow, he challenged me to prove that no birds are black.  This is not possible since we already know that many birds, including crows, are black.  Since it is impossible to do this, this is not a falsifiable claim.  It is useless, therefore, in attempting to falsify evolution.

I do believe evolution is falsifiable, however.  Dan Graur provides a potential example of how to at the 2013 meeting of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution in Chicago:

""If the human genome is indeed devoid of junk DNA as implied by the ENCODE project, then a long, undirected evolutionary process cannot explain the human genome. If, on the other hand, organisms are designed, then all DNA, or as much as possible, is expected to exhibit function. **If ENCODE is right, then Evolution is wrong**.""

Clearly Graur expects Junk DNA to follow necessarily from the truth of Evolution.

If A (Evolution), then B (Junk DNA)

Not B

Therefore not A (Evolution)

This would successfully falsify evolution, so obviously it could be done, in theory.  In fact, in may already have been done, in theory. But in practice this is never allowed to happen.  Notice, for instance, [the shell game Dawkins plays with the first premise at around 12:50 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roFdPHdhgKQ&feature=youtu.be&t=12m56s)

According to Dawkins, evolutionists have always hoped for what ENCODE has demonstrated.  In other words, according to him, evolutionists have always thought possible/hoped for this:

If A (Evolution), then not B (not Junk DNA)

Which, in effect, means evolutionists have always thought this:

If A (Evolution), then **B** (Junk DNA)

*And*

If A (Evolution), then **not B** (not Junk DNA)

And so I'm afraid it will go with attempts to falsify evolution. At the end of the day, statements like “The vast majority of the genome is junk,” or ""There are no fossil rabbits in the Precambrian"" can be adjusted to fit the evidence.  With a little shifting of goalposts, evolution can accommodate any proposition and its opposite equally well.

375,Repeatable mutations shouldn't really count as creating new genes when they're only re-creating previously existing alleles,9,True,"[**advanced topic in molecular biology**]

From Wikipedia:

http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/allele-48
>An allele is a variant form of a gene. Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome.

If we play a slot machine enough times, the same symbols will keep popping up eventually.  In fact, a biologist observing a slot machine was inspired to study random mutations creating repeatable effects over time and won the Nobel prize for it!


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luria%E2%80%93Delbr%C3%BCck_experiment

> Max Delbrück and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in part for this work....Luria (James Watson's PhD advisor) in particular was obsessed with this idea and was determined to test it. He conceived the experiment at a faculty dance at Indiana University while watching a slot machine.


So a point mutation may occur in bacteria, and if it hurts the bacteria, that point mutation won't persist in the bacterial population for very long.  If however, conditions change, like say introduction of an antibiotic, the point mutation will persist or even fix into a population.  

Luria and Delbruck were among the first to give hints that the same mutations (or class of  mutations) can arise repeatedly over and over again.  So its possible a mutation emerges and is then lost, emerges and then is lost, etc. etc.

Is it really fair to say that re-emergence of something old is therefore a brand spanking new complex trait?  I don't think so.  These are variants that can exist within the architecture of an existing created creature and they can emerge again and again from time to time.  They aren't called new genes, and it's not exactly honest when an evolutionary biologist represents them as new genes when they merely allele variants of a gene that likely existed in the past, but then were lost.  It's almost like saying a Royal flush in poker is brand new when in fact it has appeared several times in poker hands in the past.

If a few point mutations happen to enable an existing genes in a bacteria in the present day to digest nylon, this isn't a new complex trait.  It's a re-emerging allele that can be predicted to repeatably appear according to Luria-Delbruck distributions.  

In the case of nylon eating, a particular recreated allele may have been preserved in a new environment.  That's not a new gene, it's an old allele that just appears more frequently in the modern day due to changing environmental conditions.

One more thing.   In 1984 Susumu Ohno claimed 427 amino acids simultaneously and suddenly changed as a result of a frame-shift mutation (not a point mutation) in a bacteria designated KI72 and thus a new enzyme was supposedly poofed out of nowhere.  If this were the case it would have proved radically new proteins can emerge at random. 

I have since refuted Ohno's claims as purely imaginary  at r/debateevolution.  They still seem to think Ohno actually had a credible experiment!  It was all imagination accepted as an experimental result!  They remain in denial about what I pointed out.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6crtxl/creationist_claim_nylonase_didnt_evolve_becauseit/dhyo8lx/

Ohno's work is about as good as the latest hoax article, except that I think Ohno actually believed his own hoax.  
[The recent hoax I refer to is this one:
http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/]

I also pointed out the nylonase gene and enzymes are conserved in other bacteria, again suggesting the gene had existed for a long time and if there is any evolution at all, it's merely selection of a re-created or re-creatable allele.

If nylonase in KI72 evolved at all since 1935, according to Luria and Dellbruck distributions, it is likely more the result of a reappearing allele of an existing gene than the birth of a truly new complex trait.

Truly new complex traits involve a new protein with new regulatory elements and substantially new folds.  Regulation often involves a new interactome and phosphoproteome integration, etc.

Genes unique to eukaryotes that don't exist in bacteria are not the expected repeatable variety predicted by Luria-Delbruck distributions.  Darwinists however, often misrepresent common occurrence of re-created lost alleles as evidence substantially new and different genes can arise when if fact the numbers say otherwise.  It's equivocation, hasty generalization and a host of other logical fallacies.  The non-sequitur is something like saying, ""since dogs can change their size over generations, therefore potatoes and rabbits have a common ancestor.""


PS
Luria and Dellbruck are widely represented as confirming Darwinism, it does not, it confirms only the anti-Lamarkian aspect of Darwinism, not Darwin's whole theory.  Not to mention, the part that was confirmed was probably more attributable to the creationist Blyth's work which Darwin later plagiarized.",1495634481,10,2017-05-24 10:01:21

""By placing epigenetic processes, rather than gene sequence and gene expression changes, at the center of morphological origination, this book points the way to a more comprehensive thoery of evolution.""

He is not alone in criticising the current paradigm and the Third Way is, to my understanding, considered controversial.

409,"Rolling Circle Replication, a simpler way to duplicate DNA, and why I don't like the phrase ""Irreducible Complexity""",11,True,"[**for students of biology and philosophy**]

Earlier I posted on the complexity of Okazaki fragment processing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/68tj3y/evolution_or_lack_thereof_of_okazaki_fragment/

Albaniandad asked why there couldn't be another way of doing business without Okazaki fragments. Actually there is a simpler system of copying DNA known as Rolling Circle Replication.

The existence of a simpler DNA replication system illustrated by the following 1.5 minute video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmEj0ugnVWA


I've mentioned for the last year or two that I prefer not using the term ""Irreducible Complexity.""  In fact, to the extent we can not use our own specialized buzz words, I prefer that.  When Mike Behe first used the term, it sounded confusing, and it still does to me.  

Actually Mike in his book, Darwin's Black Box, used the phrase ""Rube Goldberg"" which I like better, and after his book came out 20 years ago, real scientists like Gerald Karp and Nobel Prize winner Aziz Sancar use the word ""Rube Goldberg"".  Even Larry Moran uses it.  They use it somewhat as a term of derision, but it is surprisingly accurate to convey the idea of systems endowed with more complexity than needed for survival.  In fact, it's the sort of complexity that made Darwin sick.

When Darwin saw the Peacock's tail, it made him sick.  Why?  The tail and the mating ritual that it was a part of was a survival liability, not a benefit to the species as a whole.  And proof of that is that Peacocks/Peafowls are now on endangered species lists.

Anyway, see this God-made Rube Goldberg machine:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6kGxvSX8Ahk/TaZnKOYSyaI/AAAAAAAAD8g/1F7AuZh7VLI/s1600/peacock_tail.jpg

When Darwin pondered the complex Rube Goldberg construction of the Peacock's tail, he said, ""it made him sick."" God's design made him sick because it was evidence against his idea that natural selection creates complexity.  The Peacock's tail was an example of complexity which natural selection should prevent rather than create!

Prior to Darwin, creationists viewed such contraptions like the Peacock's tail as something God made to make man wonder at his Creator.  The tail had an extravagance that made no sense if the creator's goal was only for the survival of the designed object, but the tail made sense if the creator wanted to impress man with his ingenuity.  

Do makers of man-made Rube Goldberg machines care about the needs and ""survival"" of Rube Goldberg machines?  In fact, it could be said a Rube Goldberg machine in the process of self destruction is sometimes what shows off the ingenuity of the designer.  It also emphasizes the need the Rube Goldberg machine has for it's designer.  

[As a philosophical side note, should God make man in a way that man has no need of God?  Many Darwinists complain about how man seems imperfectly made.  Man is so vulnerable and dies.  I've argued, the issue of design isn't about man's glory but God's glory.  If God made man so autonomous such that man thought he was God or felt he no longer had need of God, I don't think that would serve God's purposes.  We are made in way that shows we are designed, but also in a way that emphasizes we are not God and that we have need of God.]

Proof of simpler systems of DNA replication like Rolling Circle Replication are not evidence against design. In fact it highlights the amazing complexity of more complex DNA replication systems like those that need Okazaki fragment processing.

For what it's worth, both I and cellular biologist Jonathan McLatchie posted essays that unwittingly argued against the term ""Irreducible Complexity"".  They were good essay that defended Behe, but ironically in the process, after I wrote the essay's defending Behe, I decided the best way to defend Behe was to use the other phrase in his book:  ""Rube Goldberg"" rather than ""Irreducible Complexity"".  

Here was McLatchie's essay:
https://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/03/illustrating_ir/

which McLatchie said was inspired by my essay:

https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/mouse-trap-illustration-vs-3-glass-3-knife-illustration-irreducible-complexity-depth-of-integration/


In a video conference, I told Mike Behe how scientists like Nobel Laureat Sancar are now using the ""Rube Goldberg"" phrase and that even Gerald Karp's molecular biology book uses ""Rube Goldberg"" to describe biological processes!  Dr. Behe was delighted to hear of his influence on culture 20 years later through the phrase ""Rube Goldberg"" to describe biological systems.  He was smiling ear to ear.


Rolling Circle Replication is complex, but Okazaki fragment processing is even more complex and might be said to be Rube Goldberg complex by comparison.  Like the Peacock's tail, Okazaki fragment processing has a Rube Goldberg extravagance that is impressive beyond just enabling a creature to make more babies.

Darwinists tend to frame the debate in terms of the designed object and hence tend to be ""designeE""  (as in ""me me me"") centric.  Creationists however realize the issue isn't about survival or the designeE (as in ""me me me"") but rather the glory of the DesignER (as in ""God"").",1493820585,2,2017-05-03 10:09:45

Successful DNA replication is life critical.  If the DNA fails to replicate properly, the ""mother"" and ""daughter"" cells are toast.

Critical to this duplication process is the copying of the Okazaki fragments.  The video shows it very well.  Now, if the cell did not first have this capability to process Okazaki fragments, how did it evolve since the cell would be dead without it or some reasonable facsimile?  This is a chicken-and-egg paradox. 

You can easily see that a missing piece in the process would be lethal.  I don't like using the phrase ""Irreducibly Complex"", I prefer the phrase ""Interdependent Complexity"" as that is more descriptive. ",1493736164,45,2017-05-02 10:42:44

I will call their bluff, as I believe they are bluffing about wanting to debate.  What I believe they are saying is they want the r/creation forum destroyed through spamming and heckling much like how the so-called  SJW hecklers tried to shut down eminent professor Jordan Peterson when he visited McMaster University.

Of course if that happens he'll have to reveal his real identity.  I'm on the East coast in the mid-Atlantic region.  In lieu of that we can do something with video conferencing.

Barring that, we can debate online somewhere and he can stay anonymous. The terms are I say what I want, he says what he wants, and no mods or down voting like at reddit.  That way my comments can't be suppressed by being down voted to oblivion.

Trying to understand a couple of things.

1) Can natural selection be falsified?

2) What's the main reason that the neutral theory of evolution doesn't predict that species, in general, would look absolutely obscene, with massive amounts of useless junk hanging off of them? I get that NS is supposed to filter for fitness, but I don't see why that would lead to bodies that are practically perfect in functionality. I can only imagine that hulking monstrosities would be the norm. 

3) Imagining a stage of a simple organism which is undergoing mutation paints a picture in my mind of mutations that tend to help (a teeny amount of the time) or hinder (most of the time). Now, I understand that the leap most people are happy making is that an organism simply keeps accumulating mutations, until lucky RNG creates a functioning machine that helps the organism so much that it does far better than others. But.. that leap seems too hard. With all of the possibilities of mutations, it seems like far too much to ask that even a short sequence would ever be created towards a complex function.

DarwinZDF42 claims this is how homochirality arose:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/65pp3u/how_did_homochirality_emerge_like_this/

>One mechanism could have happened in space. Amino acids can form in space, and exposure to polarized light can lead to enantiomeric enrichment (EE), meaning that one variant is more common than the other. Here or two sources on this mechanism. 

He fails to mention all the frequent examples where polarized light fails to stop racemization of amino acids that are homochiral, like say the entire fossil record or every dead organism on the planet.  Is there enough polarized light on the planet to stop the onslaught of racemization and loss of homochirality?  Nope.  So why on Earth should we expect homochirality to naturally form on Earth when homochirality naturally goes away on Earth!

DarwinZDF42 and the researchers he sites rely on cherry picked data in non realistic environments.  Reminds me of a casino patron who lost half a million dollars after playing blackjack for several years because she focused only on her winnings rather than losses.  She relied on cherry picked data to delude herself that she could beat the casinos based on her cherry picked data (rather than acquiring the necessary card counting skills).  One has to look at realistic net trends, not isolated cherry picked data that is easily overturned by other data.

OOL researchers rely on cherry picked data of a few trivial successes in artificial lab conditions and fail to point out the overwhelming  contrary data in natural environmental conditions.  Over time it is a well known fact that amino acids, even if they started out homochiral, can't stay that way long, especially in the polymerized state.  How much more then will amino acids not be inclined to spontaneously become homochiral in real environments.  They only place where they become homomochiral ""spontaneously"" either in their imaginations of artificial non-natural experiments.



>But how do you get from a relatively small EE to homochilarity? Autocatalysis! That’s when each variant promotes formation of more like it, and suppress formation of the opposite enantiomer, as demonstrated here. 

>That mechanism can operate on earth or in space, but here’s another that’s earth-specific. Turns out physical disturbance can also lead to EE, which can then be followed by autocatalysis. 


Again, this is cherry picked data.  What about all the more natural scenarios where autocatalysis fails to happen.  Doubt me?  Consider the Humpty Dumpty argument used by Chemist James Tour which can also be applied to homochirality:

http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/putting-humpty-dumpty-back-together-again-why-is-this-a-bad-argument-for-design/

Take for example the racemic product of Urey-Miller.  Did it spontaneously become homochiral?  Nope, it stayed racemic.  Did Darwin ZDF42 point that out.  Nope.  Cherry picking again.

DarwinZDF42 fails to mention the autocatalysis experiments happen only in PURIFIED and specialized environments mostly one amino class of acid at a time, not when all 20 amino acids found in life are simultaneously in the mix.  He fails to mention the laboratory environments are not natural, but highly artificial.  How do we know that, because homochirality is naturally destroyed in real environments.  We call this racemization:

http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/tcaw/10/i02/html/02brignole.html

A professor of evolutionary biology who goes by the handle DarwinZDF42 said this of me when I implicitly suggested it takes a miracle or set of miracles to evolve a bacteria (a prokaryote) as the common ancestor something like a giraffe or tree (eukaryotes).

He said it's easy to evolve:

>**It really isn't that hard, unless you want to either lie or be ignorant.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/666psk/the_i_cant_respond_on_rcreation_so_ill_do_it_here/


I converted a pre-med biology student who was Christian Darwinist into a creationist after 1 hour conversation.  I didn't appeal to the Bible, but rather the miracles that are evident in God's creation.  

All I had to demonstrate was that universal common ancestry would require miracles to allow giraffes and trees to have a common bacterial ancestor.  If evolutionary theory needs miracles to make it work, I suggested one may as well become a creationist.

I simply asked the student what he learned in class and then argued from what he was taught.  I asked if he learned the important differences between prokaryotes (like bacteria) and eukaryotes (like humans).  He said yes.

I then posed the problems of evolving a prokaryote to a eukaryote to the student.


The problem is the origin of chromatin in Eukaryotes:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin

>Chromatin is a complex of macromolecules found in cells, consisting of DNA, protein, and RNA. The primary functions of chromatin are 1) to package DNA into a more compact, denser shape, 2) to reinforce the DNA macromolecule to allow mitosis, 3) to prevent DNA damage, and 4) to control gene expression and DNA replication. The primary protein components of chromatin are histones that compact the DNA. Chromatin is only found in eukaryotic cells (cells with defined nuclei). Prokaryotic cells have a different organization of their DNA (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called genophore and is localized within the nucleoid region).

>Chromatin's structure is currently poorly understood despite being subjected to intense investigation. Its structure depends on several factors. The overall structure depends on the stage of the cell cycle. During interphase, the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to RNA and DNA polymerases that transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the DNA. That DNA which codes genes that are actively transcribed (""turned on"") is more loosely packaged and associated with RNA polymerases (referred to as euchromatin) while that DNA which codes inactive genes (""turned off"") is more condensed and associated with structural proteins (heterochromatin).[1][2] Epigenetic chemical modification of the structural proteins in chromatin also alters the local chromatin structure, in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by methylation and acetylation. As the cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters mitosis or meiosis, the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes during anaphase. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by optical microscope.

>In general terms, there are three levels of chromatin organization:
DNA wraps around histone proteins forming nucleosomes; the ""beads on a string"" structure (euchromatin).
Multiple histones wrap into a 30 nm fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form (heterochromatin). (Definitively established to exist in vitro, the 30-nanometer fibre was not seen in recent X-ray studies of human mitotic chromosomes.[3])
Higher-level DNA packaging of the 30 nm fibre into the metaphase chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis).

Added to this I could have thrown in the problem of evolving spliceosomes and spliceosomal introns and Shine Dalgarno sequenes into Kozak consensus sequences, etc.  But regarding spliceosomes:

DarwinZDF42 obviously didn't like the fact I was converting biology students to the creationist view.  :-)


See how this professor of evolutionary biology tries to explain how such a system arose:

>Because bacteria evolved directly into humans. And we've never observed something like endosymbiosis happening. Except that we're doing just that right now with Paulinella chromatophora. 

  
>If you take the most eukaryote-like archaean, and the most archaea-like eukaryote, they're pretty darn similar morphologically and biochemically. It really isn't that hard, unless you want to either lie or be ignorant.

452,A remidner of the importance of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ,17,True,"Today is Good Friday and this is Easter weekend when Christians traditionally celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Despite differences of opinion on the age of the earth or specific aspects of evolution, we who call ourselves Christians, or Christ-followers, are united in our belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as historical events.

I hope it is not outside the bounds of this sub to post a reminder of this unity, and to encourage you that the historical evidence, while it cannot conclusively prove such an event, does support it as a reasonable possibility (and, in my opinion, as the most reasonable conclusion). In reading J. Warner Wallace's *Cold Case Christianity*, I recently came across the work of Israeli scholar Tal Ilan, summarized by Richard Bauckham in 2006, who found a statistical correlation between the most common Jewish names in the gospels and in non-Biblical sources of the same time period.

For example, Joseph and Simon were the two most common male names in both data sets (15.6% and 18.2%). The top 9 male names made up 41.5% and 40.3% of the datasets. The most common names were often given extra descriptors to help identify them (Simon Peter, Simon of Cyrene). While Matthew refers to Jesus simply as ""Jesus,"" given the context of his work, he quotes other people who called him ""Jesus of Nazareth"" or ""Jesus the Gallilean,"" which makes sense given that Jesus (Hebrew Joshua) was one of the most common names of the time. However, the most common Jewish names were different in other regions of the world, including Rome where many of the gospels are thought to have been written.

All this is better explained by the idea that the Gospels were written near the time of the events they describe by people who were eyewitnesses, than the idea that they were made up much later by people far away. (For more on these claims, see these reviews and references to Bauckham's book: [Patheos](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/inebriateme/2014/09/book-review-richard-bauckham-jesus-and-the-eyewitnesses/); [Christian Apologetics Alliance]

This is just one of many corroborative evidences that show why most scholars believe Jesus was a real person who was crucified, although there are disagreements about how to explain the claims and behaviours of his followers after that (presuppositions about the supernatural influence how reasonable you think these competing explanations are).

For those of us who are Christians, let us not become so consumed by competing claims and evidence about evolution and the age of the earth that we forget to study the competing claims and evidence regarding the most important historical event of our faith. For those of you who are not Christians, if you were convinced by a flashy Internet video that Jesus was just a copy-cat myth, but you never actually investigated those alleged correlations for yourself, or have no idea who Tacitus or Papias are, or why that matters, I encourage you to spend some time looking into these things for yourself.

Wallace's *Cold Case Christianity* is a very pro-Christian book that in my opinion makes a lot of good and up-to-date claims, but here is also a good fairly objective place to start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus",1492181509,3,2017-04-14 10:51:49
453,"Darwin used logical fallacies and rhetorical tricks to promote false narrative about evolution, not experimental and observational science",13,True,"A professor of evolutionary who goes by the handle DarwinZDF42 posted this at r/debateevolution:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/644r7o/a_little_probability_experiment_with_selection/


He suggests his intelligently designed choices illustrate what naturally happens in nature.  

He basically restates Charles Darwin's logical fallacies and rhetorical tricks  and represents them as scientific truth.

Darwin and DarwinZDF42 rely heavily on the logical fallacy of equivocation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation

>Equivocation (""to call by the same name"") is an informal logical fallacy. It is the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time). It generally occurs with polysemic words (words with multiple meanings).

for example:

>A feather is light.What is light cannot be dark.Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

Darwin equivocated the meaning of ""selection"".  Intelligent          selection often implies choice of something that is not the result of ordinary uncertainty maximizing processes like rolling dice.  

Darwin equivocates survival of the fittest complex traits in an existing population with EMREGENCE or creation of new complex traits.    Darwinian ""selection"" can't select for non-existent traits.  Yet, Darwin misrepresented the idea a new functional systems can be selected for when they don't even exist!

DarwinZDF42 selects for an improbable conceptual outcome in his mind that does not yet exist (like all dice in the ""1' configuration).  This is not what happens in nature.  Nature doesn't select for non-existent conceptual outcomes, only existent outcomes.  Nature does what is probable, not improbable.  Darwin misled the world to think nature does probably does improbable thinks.  The mainstream has swallowed Darwin's oxymoron's uncritically.

Evolutionary biologists also often fail to account for the empirically verified fact that natural selection actually helps destroy function.

Look what's happening in the present day.  Creatures like birds under intense selection because their habitat is being destroyed are going extinct.  We aren't evolving new kinds of complex birds are we by putting them under more duress in the struggle for survival!

The creatures that end up persisting on this planet under duress are simple, like bacteria and other microbes, not complex creatures like birds.

DarwinZDF42 represents his dice rolling illustration with what happens in nature.  The only place that this sort of thing happens is in imaginations of evolutionary biologists, not in ordinary natural contexts.  

Evolutionary biologists only pretend their theory doesn't require miracles and they represent macro evolution as happening under normal ordinary circumstances, when in fact it would require quite a large amount of statistical and mechanical miracles.  They claim macro evolution of humans and trees from a common ancestor would be an ordinary event because humans and trees have some of the same kinds of DNA.  But a human doesn't look anything like a tree to me, and when I ask evolutionary biologists to give a detailed explanation of why it's mechanically reasonable for a human and tree to have the same great great ....great grandma they never give convincing answers.  They usually don't realize their claims would require miracles to make universal common ancestry actually work.  If evolutionary biology needs miracles to support it, one may as well decide to be a creationist.",1492177403,19,2017-04-14 09:43:23

The movie  Case for Christ's debuts today.  Here is the trailer.  It is based on the real-life story of agnostic/atheist Lee Strobel's conversion to Christianity:

http://caseforchristmovie.pureflix.com/

As far as I can tell, Lee Strobel is an IDist and possibly an OEC...

For the record, I believe a Christian can believe in evolution, Old Earth, etc.  I myself used to be a Christian Darwinist before becoming a YEC.

Nevertheless, evidence in favor of human life being young is evidence in favor of the authenticity of the Gospel of Luke where the Genealogy of Christ is listed in Chapter 3.

There is the YEC (Young Earth Creation) and the YLC (Young Life Creation) models.  One who is a YEC is automatically an YLC, but not the other way around.  There are YLC/OECs for example.


I'm a YEC, but I argue the YLC model that postpones dealing with issues of the entire universe being young is a very defensible model.

Thus for scientific reasons alone, I think the Case for Christ is stronger than people give it credit for because the YLC model is scientifically defensible.

If the question of the age of the fossil record did not have theological implications, I don't think personally I'd invest so much into exploring the question any more than my interest in tracing the ancestry of the Kings of Persia.  But, imho, YLC sparks great interest in controversy because it is evidence for the Christian God.

471,"37-minute free cellular biology lecture by a creationist is better than a $280,000 degree in Gender Studies from Duke University",4,True,"Transgenderism and radical feminism argue against the long held and scientifically evident view that there are objective biological differences between males and females.   Transgenderists and feminists are now working to wreck some basic ideas in biology.  These ideas are actively promoted by professors in academia who teach in ""Gender Studies"" programs.

Some students at Duke University spend $280,000 to get a bachelor's degree in Gender Studies.   Here is a sample of the break down of science being promoted by Gender Studies academics:

https://shadowtolight.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/post-modernists-attack-biology/

> the fact that most females are women and most males are men needs to be explained.

>**female and male are not natural but social categories.**

https://shadowtolight.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/is-gender-studies-anti-science/

and

>biology is not a purely objective discipline that exists apart from cultural pressures; what we think of as “biology” is shaped by culture.

>Scientific knowledge is mutable, changing, and unstable. It is subject to social whims and corporate interests.

>**“Sex” isn’t made up of “biological facts,”** as Williamson believes, while gender is a social construct. Sex and gender are both socially influenced systems of categorization—the difference is that sex is allowed to posture as objective, biological, and pre-social. Sex is a reflection of our social commitment to a two-gender world.


Ironically it is the creationists who are defending biology from destruction by the transgenderists and feminists.  The existence of male and female is fundamental concept in the understanding of biology of many complex organisms like mammals.  Are evolutionary biologists standing up in the face of this assault on science?  Some are, but some aren't!  For example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/5zs6v1/evolutionist_jerry_coyne_takes_evolutionist_pz/


In contrast, the following is a free video I happened upon.  It was about cellular biology, but right there in the middle of the lecture was mention of the Creator!

What someone can learn in this 37- minute free video is more valuable than a $280,000 four-year degree from Duke University in Gender Studies.

The Gender Studies advocates say:
>A lecturer at the University of Toronto says the notion of “biological sex” — that humans are born either male or female — is a “very popular misconception.”

>Nick Matte, an historian who teaches a class on transgender studies as a part of the university’s Sexual Diversity Studies program, said the science has long been settled on the matter, reported Red Alert Politics.

>“Basically, it’s not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex,” Mr. Matte said last month on “The Agenda,” a Canadian talk show, adding that “for over 50 years scientists have shown that that’s not true.”



In contrast, Jesus says in Mark 10:  

>But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.'

472,Would anyone like to critique this post that I made on /r/DebateEvolution/? What errors do you feel I made?,9,True,"Here is the text of the original post.  You can go there if you would like to see the exchanges.

Arguments for common descent are strong when applied to creatures that interbreed with each other.  Two humans who share a broken gene are more likely to have that broken gene in common because they descended from a common human ancestor than because they developed the broken gene in themselves independently.  The arguments are not as strong when applied to creatures that do not interbreed.  Chimps and humans do not interbreed.  In order to claim that a broken gene common to chimps and humans is the result of common descent, one must first provide a probable explanation for how the ancestors of humans and chimps could have interbred in spite of the fact that they do not now interbreed.  Otherwise, one should look for other reasons to explain this shared broken gene than common descent.
  
In an earlier post, I proposed that such a gene might have broken independently among primates, but the general consensus on that thread was that, while this is possible and there are mechanisms to account for it, it is so improbable that I should not accept it as an explanation.

  
But what is the alternative?  To me, it certainly does not seem more probable that the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution has led to the increase of genetic information required to move from the first living cell to every modern form of life.  Any honest assessment of the variables involved in such a process must concede that they are unimaginable, if not incalculable.  To say that they dwarf those involved in the coincidental breaking of shared genes is a profound understatement.  As an example of just one tiny fiber in a thread of the massive tapestry of life, consider the probability of a land animal becoming a whale.  David Berlinski (Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University, a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics and molecular biology at Columbia University, author of works on systems analysis, differential topology, theoretical biology, analytic philosophy, and the philosophy of mathematics) puts this very starkly (beginning at around 11:00) in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ElA0--JNg) .   In [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c&index=4&list=PL3E4krOqKtJtPtPKjBlPi8cIfprDXijKO) , William Lane Craig cites physicists John Barrow and Frank Tippler’s actual estimate of the probability of the evolution of the human genome by the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution.  It is genuinely staggering.  And it only estimates the probability of human evolution.  What are the numbers incorporating every known life form? 
     
Why should we accept so improbable an explanation?  And if we do not have a probable explanation for common descent, why should we not look for other, less improbable, explanations for common features (i.e., common initial design, subsequent coincidental breaking of genes, etc.)?  Such explanations are not only less improbable by comparison but are in harmony with what we actually observe in things such as the inability of chimps and humans to interbreed.  Even Richard Dawkins, in [his debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwsuGiSzCkc&t=402s) with Rowan Williams (around 6:20), concedes that living creatures “look overwhelmingly as though they have been designed.”  Indeed, “appearance of design” is a frequent expression among evolutionists, which is essentially an acknowledgement that design should be the default position, to be abandoned only when a more probable explanation appears.

474,Geology of the Cumberland Plateau,6,True,"I've been hiking in the Cumberlands of Kentucky and Tennessee for well over 20 years now.  I've seen a lot of limestone and sandstone.  I've been in information technology my entire career so I'm naturally logically minded and inquisitive and what I see just makes no sense, if I try to interpret it within the scope of uniformitarianism.

Take for example Cumberland Falls in the Pottsville formation of the Cumberland Plateau.  The cliffs in this area consist of Pennsylvanian Sandstone which supposedly was laid down by 300 mya.  Cumberland Falls is approximately 45 miles away from the escarpment of this formation in Burnside, KY.  If we calculate the distance with the age of the bedrock... we learn that for the Falls to be in its present location, assuming uniformitarianism and the current assumptions that its been traveling .009 inches per year, for 300 million years.  This is also just lateral erosion.  This doesn't account for the fact that the falls is 400 feet below the top of the formation in elevation.

I have a very, very hard time believing this.  Number one we have 60 foot sandstone cliffs on my parents farm that are in the same formation and I've seen them separate and crash down in the valleys during freeze/thaw periods.  This occurred with standard freezing/thawing.  This didn't occur during a flood, earthquake, etc.  We know that in the early 1800s a cataclysmic earthquake occurred near New Madrid that had far reaching geologic circumstances.  Major floods can completely arrange the course of rivers.  I know this as a fact because I'm a canoer and the Rockcastle river, in the same area, has had major rapids washed out due to flooding.  Since it has been gauged Cumberland river has flown as slowly as 8 cfs to as high as 60,000 cfs.  When the river gets up to 60,000 cfs it can move house-sized boulders.

Uniformitarianism makes no sense whatsoever when you compare it to experience.  I want someone to give me a better explanation of the formations I see, how they erode, why they are falling apart and what events caused it.

Its a fascinating area... my favorite place on this Earth and I think our youth deserves a better story as to how it was formed.  I've been hearing the same tired (most likely false) story from every park ranger, nature center and museum since I was a child.  The numbers don't add up.

I then pointed out human genomes have on the order of 100 potentially function compromising mutations per generation per individual, way past Muller's limit, therefore many are concerned we could be going extinct.  That concern has been raised by distinguished geneticists like Michael Lynch at the NAS and Bryan Sykes at Oxford.  

My very long tedious essay was posted here:

He offers how why he thinks the problem Nobel prize winners like Muller's problem isn't a problem and tries to make the case my essay is misguided.  Here is a sample of what the moderator at r/debateevolution had to say to attempt to rebut my points:



>I got a dick and balls. It's mostly about those balls though: did you know the average ejaculation has between 200 and 500 million individual sperms? You know what's the most interesting thing about my sperms? They only have half my genome.

>Why does that matter? Well, I have two copies of every gene. If I pick up a bad one, hopefully the second is okay. But if my sperm gets a bad one, he's a dead sperm. He's not making it to the egg -- he's one of these badboys. Sperm isn't as complex as a person, so this genetic beta test isn't perfect -- but it's enough that most serious errors get caught long before there's an individual.

>....So, what does he close this shitty video with?


>[stcordova said]: Note the persistence of bad mutations despite any conceivable mechanism of selection. 

>[Dzugavili responded]: Yes. No conceivable mechanism. Conceivable. As in conception. Penis-in-vagina. Am I dumbing this down enough?


Ok, he's clearly angered by what I said, and I'll point out where some of his responses are scientifically flawed.  

First, Dzugavili makes the flawed assumption a genetic defect in the dad necessarily means the sperm will die!  Not so.  Sperm with defective genes can still pass on defective genes to the offspring as long as the genes in the sperm don't cause the sperm to die, that is a known fact.

Second, the woman generally uses only 1 ovum egg in the process, so that explanation does work for maternal inheritance, plus it suffers also from the flawed assumption that bad genes in the ovum egg necessarily mean the ovum egg would not be viable to make embryos.

Now, did the professor of evolutionary biology DarwinZDF42 point Dzugavili's mistake to Dzugavili?  Would he let something like that get a pass in his evolutionary biology classes?  I hope not!  If I said something like that, professor DarwinZDF42 would have pounced all over it, but instead he gave Dzugavili a passing grade in that discussion and said of me:

482,The Compounding Interest Paradox vs. the claim of fossil contamination by C14 and unracemized amino acids,11,True,"The presence of C14 and unracemized amino acids in supposedly old fossils is strong reason to doubt the fossil record is hundreds of millions of years old.  Darwinists insist the primary reason for the presence of C14 and unracemized amino acids is due to in situ contamination (contamination while buried).  Their claim would be credible if C14 and the homochiral amino acids didn't have half-lives!  Because the supposed contaminants have half-lives, the claim of contamination has many problems.  This essay attempts to give a more qualitative treatment than the more quantitative treatment I gave earlier:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/2q0rtd/c14_contamination_fix_has_its_own_problems/

From a non-theological standpoint, one can believe in an Old Universe, and Old Earth and a recent fossil record.   The age of the fossil record is a question of establishing the time of death, somewhat like a detective.  It is not a theological claim in a strict sense.

It is illogical to date a fossil by the age of the rocks that its buried in.  If someone buried a live dog today in 100 million year-old rock, does it make the poor dog a 100 million-year-old fossil?  No.  The time of death is better determined by looking at the fossil itself for clues to the time of death than the age of the rocks the fossil is buried in.  The presence of C14 and unracemized amino acids in the fossil rule out a fossil being hundreds of millions of years old.

Darwinists invoke contamination by C14 and unracemized amino acids, but that is falsified by the Compounding Interest Paradox.

To understand the Compounding Interest Paradox.  Suppose you gave yourself the task of keeping some water warm at by adding boiling water to it.  

Say you started off with a cup of warm water.  It cools to room temperature.  So you grab a cup of boiling water and mix it with the cool water to get it warm.    You have effectively raised the temperature of the mix by adding a boiling water ""contaminant"". But unfortunately, the ""contaminant"" has a half-life.  

In not too long you'll be stuck not with 1 cup of cool water, but 2 cups of cool water.  To elevate the temperature of the 2 cups of water, you grab 2 cups of boiling water and repeat the process.  But then mix of warm water becomes 4 cups of cool water because the heat from the boiling water doesn't stay there forever, it has a half-life.  

In not too long, restoring warmth to your sample of water by adding boiling water ""contaminant"" to it will entail needing to add an entire lake of boiling water!

The problem with claiming contaminants are added in situ is fraught with the same problem of adding outside c14-containing carbon and amino acid contaminants over millions of years to the original fossil with no credible means of removing it after the contaminant decays.

The Darwinists will respond by saying, ""That's true, but that's not a problem because the contamination was recent, it didn't happen continuously for millions of years.""  

To which I say, ""so the entire supposed 300,000,000-year-old Carboniferous era fossils (like coal) that has all these traces of C14 in them got contaminated GLOBALLY in the last 50,000 years for no good reason? Reductio ad absurbum!  And How about marble and diamonds that aren't exactly porous to absorb contaminants?!""  We find C14 traces in most coals we've tested around the globe when we were actually willing to date the coals.  

The problem became so severe that physicists who needed C14-free carbon for their sub-atomic particle experiments gave up believing the paleontologists who said 300,000,000 million year coal would be free of C14.  It wasn't.  If the Darwinists were right, physicists would be using that supposed 300,000,000 million year old coal.   Moral of the story, when the claim of the fossils being hundreds of millions of years old really counts for scientific applications like physics, it fails.  It's more of an dogma than settled experimental science.

483,Amino acid racemization dating primer,8,True,"[**advanced chemistry and biochemistry topic, not for the faint of heart**]



This is something of a data dump as I'm pressed for time.  

A little reading between the lines of the following hard-to-read papers indicates the fossils are arguably young.  The following papers are confusing and hard to read, and I'm working with chemists and biochemists to make something more readable.

Even though these are YEC papers, they totally miss the important point that the data suggests the fossils are young.  They were so eager to question the accuracy of radiometric methods and discredit amino-acid dating, they didn't realize they had a gift handed to them if they were just willing to adopt a different perspective!  

The gist of the problem.  Not only do radioactive materials have half-lives, so do certain chemicals.  Soft tissue fossils are a red flag to the claim the fossils are millions of years old, but ""soft tissue"" is a bit of a qualitative metric.  Amino acid racemization state is a more quantitative metric.  But even though amino acid racemization dating suffers from inaccuracies, one thing it should be accurate about is how old a fossil cannot be.  That is, suppose we take the most favorable conditions as an assumption to slowing the amino acid half-life down, should the fossils still look young?  No.  Ergo the fossil look young because they are young.

OK the technical details, but not for the faint of heart and not for those who can't read through confusing papers:

The ""easy"" to read discussion:
http://www.creation-science-prophecy.com/amino/


The hard to read and confusing discussion with good data points:
http://www.grisda.org/origins/12008.htm

>**The survival of amino acids in fossils from the Paleozoic era and the trend for the apparent racemization rate constant to decrease with conventional fossil age assignment raise a serious question concerning the accuracy with which radioisotope age data have been used to represent the real-time history of fossils.**


The paper uses the term ""rate constant"".  Where the term ""rate constant"" comes from is the solution to a differential equation that invokes a decaying exponential function that somewhat looks like:



L(t)  = e^ { [rate_constant x t] + some_other_constant }

which comes from the natural log solution to the differential equations that look something like

ln L(t)  =rate_constant x t + some_other_constant

where L is the amount of L-amino acids.  The ""rate constant"" is supposed to be a chemical half-life that after being adjusted for temperature and a stable chemical environment, should be constant.  There should be limits to the half-life changing.   So the ""rate constant"" reported in mainstream science isn't really constant!  Argh!

These papers show the computed half life changes too much if we assume the geologic column is dated millions of years old.   A 400 million year old fossil should be completely racemized and effectively none of the original amino acids should still be homochiral but completely racemized.

They can just make responses effectively invisible by downvoting them in obscure branches.  So they drown out the truth with noise.

Now, there is a way you can sort comments, the default is ""best"", but that is meaningless when they downvote robotically.  So that you can really see my responses select ""new"" and you'll get to see my latest responses, because when I'm out numbered 30 to 1, there is no point branching off into oblivion, I'll just respond to questions that I deem worthy by posting comments to my own OP.  

Please sort through comments this way, and take a look at:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61625n/darwinzdf42_cant_explain_evolution_of/

You might have a bit more access to the truth.  That way you can cut through a lot of the heckling.

If IDists and creationists want me to respond to specific questions in that thread, just state the question here at r/creation you want me to respond to.

So what will likely happen is you'll see one new comment from me, and then a swarm of junk, but then I'll post another comment.  Use your scroll bar to see my responses to the comments I deem helpful to respond to.  Now if you really want to read through some of the bad, nothing is stopping you.  Free speech, but also free listening!

How do I judge what comment by them is worthy of a response by me?  Well if it's something I've not already addressed for starters.  If it is relevant. If my response will highlight the false nature of my opponent's comments.

For example, some guy over there wanted to argue the probability of evolution is much higher because of unknown yet-to-be detected subatomic elementary particles for which we have no observations and which he just imagined out of the air.  Rather than deal with the actual statistics, he goes into fantasy land.  That is a comment worth highlighting because it shows the strength of my statistical arguments and shows the extreme avoidance strategies employed by evolutionists to deal with the substance of what I'm trying to say.

I want to serve the r/creation community by responding to questions you have here over there.  The reason for that is you can see for yourself if my answers can be actually refuted.  It should be reassuring to you that most of the time all these guys can do is misrepresent, insult, and literature bluff (cite circularly reasoned peer-reviewed published articles by peer-reviewers who are accepting circular reasoning as an argument).

I'm not debating these guys to persuade the Darwinists over yonder, I'm debating these guys to persuade and teach the creationists and IDists here.   

Since I'm doing this mostly for the creationists and IDists, I'll take action on requests by creationists and IDists.  Evolutionists can post there questions at r/debatevolution.

487,I am a flat farther and I have a few very sincere question for creationists.,7,True,"Let me start by stating that I am not a Christian or even religious and I have not yet looked into the Creation/Intelligent design theory. I guess as far as this subject goes, I am a fence sitter. I respect anybody who questions mainstream science. 

While the Bible is NOT the foundation of the Flat earth model, I find it very interesting that it very accurately describes the flat earth model.

- **The Bible describes the earth as being flat and stationary**

“He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.” - 1 Chronicles 16:30 

“Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ...” - Psalm 93:1

“He has fixed the earth firm, immovable ...” - Psalm 96:10

“Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken.” - Psalm 104:5


- **The Bible describes the sky as being a solid structure**

""Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?"" - Job 37:18

“...the heavens were thy handiwork.” - Psalm 102:25

""The sky was rolled up like a scroll"" - Revelation 6:14

“I, with my own hands, stretched out the heavens and caused all their host to shine...” - Isaiah 45:12

(In other words, when you look at the sky you are looking at a solid object, its not just a view into ""space"")


- **The Bible describes the sun and moon as being lights INSIDE the firmament**

""And God said, Let there be lights **in** the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. And let them be for lights **in** the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so."" - Genesis 1:15


- **The Bible describes that the sun and moon have their own orbits over earth**

""And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day."" - Joshua 10:13

“...the sun, who comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy, rejoicing like a strong man to run his race. His rising is at one end of the heavens, his circuit touches their farthest ends; and nothing is hidden from his heat - Psalm 19:4-6


- **The Bible describes the stars as being much smaller and being close enough to the earth to fall down to it**

""and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind"" - Revelation 6:13


Given all the above, it is quite bewildering to me how Creationists take the Bibles account of creation literally and, at the same time, dismiss the Bibles description of the flat and stationary earth, sun, moon and stars as being metaphorical or allegorical.

Don't you realize that the same people who mock Creationism are also pushing the heliocentric model in schools and universities? How can you trust these secular heliocentric scientists (who also accept Darwinism) over the words of your own Holy Bible?

Why do you think its impossible that God created a flat earth with the sun and moon moving over it?

If God created earth as a ball spinning around the sun, why didn't He say so in the Bible? Why does the Bible describe earth/sun/moon/sky in a way thats 100% compatible with the flat earth model? 

**As Creationists, why can't the flat earth model be incorporated into your belief system?** Remember, you don't have to accept the flat earth model simply because the Bible says so. In reality, the flat earth model is substantiated by evidence, logic and reason.

491,What are your stances on creationism?,9,True,"Introduction to myself for some context, maybe it'll be somehow important. 

I live in Europe, Germany to be exact, and we don't have that many creationists here. At least I, on my part, have never encountered a creationist, at least not a christian one. Though I did encounter Muslims which don't approve of evolution, and thus could be called creationists in a way, they are in a rather small number and most are rather older people, at least in my experience.

I have only a Gymnasium (which is in a way equivalent of US's high school) degree of bioogy, and thus also evolution. Though I did learn more privately, I wouldn't say there is much diference.

I'm not a creationist. Though I do believe in ID somewhat, at least according to the definition given in the sidebar link. The main problem I have with creationism is not the belief that evolution is wrong, but that a certain religion's creation myth is the new truth. There are thousands of creation myths. (I even read that the bible has two rather contradictionary creation myths). In addition, not about creationism per se, but I'm strongly against teaching it instead of evolution, as it's done in some places of the US. Even if evolution, I don't think it's right to teach then the creaion myth of religion you believe in.

As I already wrote in Germany creationism isn't really wide spread, and in addition to that there is usually no debate on whether evolution can be even wrong. There are some people, disproportionally Muslims in my experience, who have views that evolution is wrong, but that's a rather small minority. Thus it's really strange to me that in a highly developed country like the US there are so many fundamental believers. So I'd like to know what your stances on creationism are and also explain to me creationism a little better from your point of view.
_______

Do you think creationism should be taught in school? And how? Instead of evolution, together with evolution in biology class or together with evolution in different classes?

Do you think of creationism more of a belief or more of a scientific fact? If fact, what is the evidence that your religious belief is more valid than other religious believes? If belief, why do creationists advocate creationism over evolution?

I assume most creationists here are christians, but to keep things neutral imagine X being your religion. Why do you believe that X's creation myth is correct and creation myths of other religions like Christianity, Islam, Jewish (I assume though that the first two have almost identical creation myths, being Abrahamic religions), Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese Folk religion, Zoroastrianism or Shinto, or well attested extinct religions like Ancient Greek religion, A. Egyptian religion, A. Germanic (not that well attested though), Tengrism or A. Mesopotamian religion, or any other rather obscure religion extinct or not, like native religions of the Native Americans, the Aboriginals or Africans? If you view creationism as a scientific fact, then there should be a scientific way to determine the right religion's creation myth. However how would you do that? 

If it's only a belief I see no problems, but if you think creationism should be taught at school instead of evolution, then why do you justify picking X's creation myth over one mentioned above, because isn't it just imposing your own belief on other people (similar to how evolution is imposed on you)?

If evolution is wrong, why do you think so few biological scientists believe in creationism?

I hope it's not too many questions because the sidebar recommends to fit in it's better to ask only about single topics, but I think it's better than to ask all the question in different posts.

492,"Phylogenetic Obfuscation and other Logical Fallacies, Literature Bluffing, etc.",5,True,"Since I'm debating an evolutionary biologist at r/debateEvolution, I think it would be appropriate to describe the playbook that they debate from.  Most of evolutionary theory, starting with Darwin isn't built on science but logical fallacies.

Here is an excellent list of fallacies written by a brilliant atheist:
https://infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/logic.html

Ironically it describes so much of the arguments that evolutionary theory is built on.  The trick in debate is cutting through the fallacy and making a persuasive argument that a fallacy was actually put forward.

I use the phrase ""phylogenetic obfuscation"" sometimes.  From wiki here is obfuscation:
>Obfuscation is the willful obscuring of the intended meaning of communication, usually by making the message confusing, ambiguous, or difficult to understand. The obfuscation might be unintentional or intentional (although intent usually is connoted), and is accomplished with circumlocution (talking around the subject), the use of jargon (technical language of a profession), and the use of an argot (ingroup language) of little communicative value to outsiders.[1]

>Moreover, in expository writing, unintentional obfuscation usually is a writer's trait in draft documents, when just beginning the composition; such obfuscation can be illuminated with critical thinking and revision, either by the writer or by an editor. Etymologically, the word obfuscation derives from the Latin obfuscatio, from obfuscāre (to darken). Synonyms for the obscuring of meaning include: beclouding and abstrusity.


""Phylogenetic"" refers to the claim if two things are similar, they necessarily share a common ancestor, and that if they share a common ancestor, the evolution from a common ancestor isn't improbable and does not require miracles.

Humans share many genes with a banana.  Rabbits share many genes with a potato.  Does that mean it is highly probable a potato can evolve into a rabbit?  No, even an evolutionary biologist will say so.   So how is it then they will argue that potatoes and rabbits have the same grandma way way back?  ""because they share so many of the same genes"" the answer goes, but it has many of the same logical fallacies of evolving a rabbit from a potato, namely the stuff that isn't similar.  They forget to mention the problem of the genes they don't share, the so called ""orphans"" and ""taxonomically restricted genes"" plus other things called autapomorphies, etc.

It's cherry picked data.  Another logical fallacy.

Here is an example of phylogenetic obfuscation.  Most creatures share the same genetic codon table (aka the DNA code).  They use that to claim it's easy for creatures to evolve from a common ancestor and that life arose by itself without God's help.  In logical terms these are non-sequiturs.

A non-sequitur:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic)

>A non sequitur (Latin for ""it does not follow""), in formal logic, is an invalid argument.[1] In a non sequitur, the conclusion could be either true or false (because there is a disconnect between the premises and the conclusion), but the argument nonetheless asserts the conclusion to be true and is thus fallacious. While a logical argument is a non sequitur if, and only if, it is invalid (and so, technically, the terms 'invalid argument' and 'non sequitur' are equivalent), the word 'non sequitur' is typically used to refer to those types of invalid arguments which do not constitute logical fallacies covered by particular terms (e.g. affirming the consequent). In other words, in practice, 'non sequitur' is used to refer to an unnamed logical fallacy. Often, in fact, 'non sequitur' is used when an irrelevancy is showing up in the conclusion. The term has special applicability in law, having a formal legal definition.[further explanation needed]

When the non-sequitur is combined with other logical fallacies it can be a powerful (albeit deceitful) debate tool.

A good example is the Chewbacca Defense:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca_defense

>A Chewbacca defense is the name in the United States given to a legal strategy in which the aim of the argument seems to be to deliberately confuse the jury rather than to factually refute the case of the other side. This term was used in an episode of the animated series South Park, ""Chef Aid"", which premiered on October 7, 1998. This episode satirized attorney Johnnie Cochran's closing argument defending O. J. Simpson in his murder trial. The term has since been commonly used in describing legal cases, especially criminal ones. The concept of disguising a flaw in one's argument by presenting large amounts of irrelevant information has previously been described as the modern-day equivalent of a red herring or the fallacy ignoratio elenchi (irrelevant conclusion).[1]


Evolutionary theory is built mostly of logical fallacies.  I expect if DarwinZDF42 debates me he'll be quoting from evolutionary literature which has lots of these.   His associates are already doing some literature bluffing.

http://www.discovery.org/a/2228

>Literature bluffing is the indiscriminate citation of scientific papers and articles whose titles or abstracts may seem germane to the problem at hand, but which on careful reading prove not to settle the issue, or even not to have any relevance to it. Like a squid spewing out ink to confuse a pursuer, or a fighter jet dispensing chaff to deflect incoming missiles, a literature bluffer floods the discussion with citations to distract attention from the real issues.

>Bibliographic search engines such as PubMed make it easy for literature bluffers to compile long lists of citations. The literature bluffer, however, rarely explains the arguments or evidence contained in the publications on the list. That would defeat the bluffer's purpose, which is not really to address the merits of the case, but rather to overwhelm the reader with the apparent weight of scientific authority. The reader is then left with the work of actually studying the publications and assessing their relevance.

People pre-disposed to reject reasonable criticisms of evolutionary theory eat up literature bluffs like crazy.  They rarely stick around to actually see evolutionary arguments actually taken apart.

In the past, I've taught a 400-level on evolution and disease, and a 100-level on the same topic for non-life-science majors. (That one was probably the most fun, and I hope to be able to do it again in the near future.)

My degree is in genetics and microbiology, and my thesis was about viral evolution. I'm not presently conducting any research, which is fine by me, because there's nothing I like more than teaching and discussing biology, particularly evolutionary biology. 

 

So with that in mind, ask me anything. General, specific, I'm happy to talk about pretty much anything.

401,Evolutionist Jerry Coyne takes Evolutionist PZ Myers to the woodshed,5,True,"The following passage is informative on so many levels.  As a card carrying creationist, this was an example of an evolutionary biologist actually articulating some interesting facts.

https://shadowtolight.wordpress.com/2017/03/15/coyne-throttles-myers/



>But someone who should know better is the evolutionary biologist and blogger P. Z. Myers, who bought into Fine’s bogus argument and fallacious mathematics in a post called “Cordelia Fine is doing the math.” Myers accepts Fine’s contention that promiscuous males don’t really have more offspring than do choosy human females—females who are prevented from getting fertilized when they’re pregnant.  Her arguments are wrong—for one thing, she sets unrealistic error limits for promiscuous males to outdo monogamous ones—but Myers has always rejected biology that is ideologically unpalatable to him.

>In a rare occurrence at his site, the commenters, usually a choir of osculatory praise, gave him pushback. In fact one,  “Charly”, did the math correctly and showed that males in relationships with multiple females (bigamous or polygamous) have the potential to have more offspring than do monogamous males, supporting the ideas that **men are selected to compete for women. (Duh!)** Charly ended his calculations with this statement: “But maybe my reasoning and math is wrong, I am sure someone will point flaws out.”

>In the next comment, Myers admitted that Charly’s math was actually right—math that invalidates Fine’s argument—but then he said this:

>Your math is fine. It’s your humanity that is broken.

>And there we have it, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters: an admission that the biology is right, at least in theory, but the person who did the calculations is immoral. **What better example can we find of someone who opposes the truth because it’s ideologically repugnant?** Even Myers’s regular commenters couldn’t live with that pronouncement. …

403,"My college level ID course was tentatively approved at un-accredited Bible College, request for some IT help to help advertise it",6,True,"Christian colleges don't teach college courses on creation and ID since the topic offends so many in Christian academia.  Doubt me?  Look for yourself at course listings in a typical Christian colleges, even YEC-leaning ones!

Some students at Duke University pay $70,000 a year to take part in the ""Gender and Feminist Studies"" program that teaches unbelievably useless knowledge along with a lot of bad statistics and science.  For example, it is known that there are neurological differences in the brains of males and females.  Differences perhaps substantial enough to be medically significant.  But those truths won't be taught in such a program because it goes against their narrative.  But it's an ""accredited"" narrative, though false one.  
http://gendersexualityfeminist.duke.edu/

So, I've grown negative on the value of ""accreditation"" which  used to be a good thing, but now just a means of plundering students of money and teaching falsehoods in next to worthless if not harmful subjects.    But even for basic good subjects, charging $6,000 to teach algebra, when it could be done online for $100, and maybe even better.  This seems predatory imho.

Members of r/creation get more good stuff for free than they would in a $280,000 ""Gender and Feminist Studies"" program at Duke.

I have no problem with attending accredited universities.  I have 4 science degrees from accredited and respected institutions like George Mason and Johns Hopkins. Thankfully I got my degrees cheap and paid by employers. :-)

But since ""creation science"" will probably not be accredited any time soon even within Christian universities, I have no problem going the un-accredited route.   And outside the USA in 3rd world countries where prospective pastors just want to learn truth, and where a degree in Bible won't land them a secular job anyway, then accreditation doesn't matter.  What matters is what is taught and how well it can be learned.  I took piano lessons for years just because I wanted to learn, not because it was ""accredited"". 

I offered to teach ID through distance learning for free at Trinity College of the Bible.  And my offer got accepted.

For $35 one can audit the course and get the equivalent of 3 semester hours of learning if they are determined to learn the material. The money will go to Trinity College, which is fine with me since they will offer the course on a graded basis, and they need to cover the expenses for hiring graders and doing admin work.

It is tentatively scheduled for the Fall of 2017.  The course will be offered electronically to 140 different countries around the world.

That's said, I need some IT help with my own personal website to help advertise the course.  I need some basic help to just fight the Spam bots from the Ukraine spamming my wordpress blog.  Can someone help?

406,"An NCSE 1985 Classic: ""New Protein's Without God's Help""",5,True,"John Sanford recently asked me to investigate the claims of the evolution of nylon-eating bacteria.    

In 1975, researchers claimed a brand spanking new gene not found in any other bacteria suddenly evolved out of nowhere around 1940 and conferred the ability of bacteria to digest nylon.


So I found this 1985 article by the NCSE along the way that said this:


The NCSE even said in this article:


https://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help
>**New Protein's Without God's Help

>""We've been trying to explain all this to the protein ""experts"" at ICR for the last seven years. We have told them that new proteins could indeed form from the random ordering of amino acids. We have warned them that their calculations were based on faulty assumptions and soon someone would document the natural formation of a new protein from the random association of amino acids.

>Now it has happened! Not one, but two, new proteins have been discovered. In all probability **new proteins are forming by this process all the time, but this seems to be the first documentation of this phenomenon. The newly discovered proteins are enzymes that break down some of the byproducts produced during nylon manufacture. Since nylon first came into commercial production in 1940, we know that the new enzymes have formed since that time.**""

 
Well I snooped around, and with the power of Google and BLAST, I found out these proteins had probably been around and in other organisms!  They weren't new, but there was not anyway to know that in 1975 (42 years ago) because we simply hadn't sequenced enough genomes then.

What's really embarrassing is that one of the original researchers in Japan involved in the promotion of the ""newly evolved genes"" of 1975 was the very same guy in 2007 who found genes in other bacteria that did the job better and were laying around in a sewer.  So it is highly unlikely these were really new genes as claimed.   It was just sloppy reporting and a rush to judgement in the absence of evidence.  They were all soooo sure no other bacteria had the nylon eating gene, therefore it must have evolved in a flash since 1940.  A lot of ink was wasted at the National Academy of Sciences promoting how something could evolve soooo fast via gene duplication.  Oh well...

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172308700148

The author (Negoro) still claims the evolution of nylon bacteria since 1940 despite the fact he's the one that found evidence to the contrary!


NOTES:

How I figured this out.

With some snooping I figured out the necessary identification number (accession number) of one of the enzymes ""evolved from random amino acid that was never on the Earth until man created nylon.""  (NOT!)  

It turns out a few bacteria have protein almost identical to this enzyme, and many more with recognizable homologues to the necessary 6-aminohexanoate hydrolase enzyme.


I went to this website and 

https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi


and entered the accession number:

BAA01528.1



I got at least 4 good hits, indicating the protein probably pre-existed before it was supposedly evolved de-novo since 1940.  Like so many things, new scientific developments overturn the boasts of evolutionary biologists.  But this one lasted since 1975...around 42 years!

It led me to the paper cited above.  I'm waiting to find out if John Sanford wants me to do a write up of this.  If so, it may require a few co-authors with specialties in biochemistry and molecular genomics.

HT: Cornelius Hunter

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308131123.htm

>EPFL scientists have carried out a genomic and evolutionary study of a large and enigmatic family of human proteins, to demonstrate that it is responsible for harnessing the millions of transposable elements in the human genome. The work reveals the largely species-specific gene-regulatory networks that impact all of human biology, in both health and disease.
...

>The data from the study demonstrate that KZFP partner up with transposable elements to create what the authors call ""a largely species-restricted layer of epigenetic regulation."" Epigenetics refers to biological processes -- mostly biochemical modifications of the DNA and its associated proteins -- that condition the expression or repression of genes. As a field, epigenetics has come into prominence in recent years, revealing a previously unimagined complexity and elegance in genetics.

>""KZFPs contribute to make human biology unique,"" says Trono. ""Together with their genomic targets, they likely influence every single event in human physiology and pathology, and do so by being largely species-specific -- the general system exists in many vertebrates, but most of its components are different in each case."" The findings of this work will help scientists identify possible shortcomings of current animal models and construct a more accurate picture of how genes work in humans.

>""This paper lifts the lid off something that had been largely unsuspected: the tremendous species-specific dimension of human gene regulation,"" says Trono. ""It has profound implications for our understanding of human development and physiology, and gives us a remarkable wealth of resources to examine how disturbances of this system might result in diseases such as cancer.""

[I’ve made a suggestion a while ago]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/5p2wii/what_if_we_had_a_weekly_research_topic/) to start a ‘monthly research topic’ on this sub. A lot of people showed interest so here is the first post! 

 

**What is the ‘monthly research topic’?**

The ‘monthly research topic’ is a research/discussion post where we research a topic that we pick out each month to learn from each other and see what each other’s views are.
For those who don’t know anything about the current topic: don’t be afraid to ask. This post isn’t here so we could debate each other. 
For those who know a lot about the current topic: don’t go in debate modus. Give the reader an explanation about what it is/what you read. It would be wise to cite your sources.

 

**What do I post?**

Post a description about what you’ve learned or what the current topic is about. Post your own opinion on the subject and tell us if it supports the view of creation or evolution.  
If you want to make a comment about someone’s research, tell him what you’ve learned and post your own opinion on the subject. 

In other words: Don’t comment: “WOW U r SO Stuped and wrong!111 beCaUse this suPports Creatiun and Evolutien”. 

A reasonable comment would be: “Oh, you think this supports Evolution? Well, I’ve read on (source) that A, B and C. Don’t you think that if you read C it supports the view of the creationists?”

 

**This month’s topic**

The search topic for this month is: [Phylogenetic Incongruence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891620).

**Please notice:**

* This is not a /r/DebateAChristian, /r/DebateEvolution or /r/DebateCreation post. We are here to learn and thus I ask you to respect another’s views. 
* Don’t cite or post source articles as Creation.com, Wikipedia, or Science Daily. Do the research on the original articles/papers that are referenced in the article. 

 

*Both /u/eagles107 and /u/viridiel will make new posts with a new topic each month and give a summary on the end with a conclusion.* ",1488814529,8,2017-03-06 10:35:29
