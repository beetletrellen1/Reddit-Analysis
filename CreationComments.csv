1,"&gt; It is monstrously improbable according to realistic mathematical models and computer simulations

With infinite time infinite things will happen, we just had enough time.

&gt; Observation of evolution in unicellular eukaryotes like malaria,  indicates that natural selection acting on random mutations cannot produce complex functional systems.

Genetic entropy: Accumulating random mutations in the genome should eventually destroy a species.

Do you have proof for either of these because with enough mutations complex systems can form through little changes over time. As for the second point, random mutations that aren't advantageous for a species die off so only the successful ones are passed on.

I'm not sure what you mean by 80% of the genome is expressed but if you need my to clarify anything I'm in grad school studying microbiology so I can help you out.",1,1521935878,2018-03-24 19:57:58
2,"That's a bad analogy, though. It's more comparable to duplicating the instruction ""Add a teaspoon of sugar"" in a recipe. If that makes the resulting product better, I'd say that's an increase in information.

&gt;If a 1000 nucleotide transposon in an amoeba runs amuck and copies itself 3 million times over the course of 100 generations, should we expect any other organism to evolve 3 billion nucleotides of unique and specific information over 100 generations.

6,"My definition of functional information/nucleotides is the number of unique nucleotide sequences that contribute to function.  Thus a duplicated gene wouldn't meet that ""unique criteria.""  

This definition is what I think most people have in mind when they think of evolution creating information, when thinking about quantifying useful information in general, and it's the most difficult part genomes for evolution to account for.  Although I readily admit I'm not always as clear in communicating this as I am thinking about it in my head.

There may also be situations about measuring functional information I haven't accounted for, but I think my argument about observed rates of functional evolution still works even if the definition of functional information comes with a margin of error.

7,"Ok, the ENCODE project.

The irony is that major players on the evolution side and creation side have agreed if the NIH ENCODE project is correct, then evolution is false.

Evolutionary biologist Dan Graur said:  ""If ENCODE is right, evolution is wrong.""

This is based on mutational load theory.  Simply put, if a couple has 10 kids, and all 10 kids have some mild birth defect in their DNA (usually not immediately detectable since it is so slight), then even assuming natural selection, since all the kids are more sickly than their parents, evolution and natural selection can't lead to improvement.  Nobel Prize winner Hermann Muller who did research of mutations deduced if each person has on average 1 bad mutation per generation, the human race will be deteriorating.

This level of bad mutation will be the case if the DNA in humans is mostly functional. This is because most mutations are bad (say 90-99.999%), and with a mutation rate of about 100 DNA bases per person per generation, then this implies we are way past Muller's limit as we are having about 100 bad mutation per kid per generation.  There is good evidence, of this, btw....

Evolutionary biologists, faced with this problem have said the solution is to assume most of the human genome is junk, and therefore there aren't really that many bad mutations per kid.  And btw, genetic deterioration rather than improvement goes contrary to the notion that evolution improves things.  Genetic De-evolution suggests something other than evolution created human beings in a better state once upon a time before they started to deteriorate....er, like Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.


The ENCODE consortium is a consoritum that studies the DNA/chromatin complexes as part of understanding heritable diseases and cancer argues that the evolutionary biologists are wrong because the human genome is 80-100% functional.

The ENCODE consortium has over 200 researchers from the world's top academic institutions from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc, and it as well as sister projects have invested close to 1 billion dollars.

Evolutionary biologists like Dan Graur were livid calling the NIH-funded researchers: ""crooks"", ""ignoramuses"", ""the scientific equivalent of Saddam Hussein""  etc.

Ah yes, the old fights over money and prestige.  Graur is mad that medical researchers are getting a large cut of government grants and that he's being relegated to irrelevance.  He accuses the head of the NIH, Francis Collins, of being a creationist.

OK, for your edification.  

Regarding Graur and ENCODE specifically (with some philosophy and economics mixed in):

http://www.creationevolutionuniversity.org/public_blogs/skepticalzone/paper31.pdf

Here is a rehearsal presentation I gave to faculty and deans at the Christian Scholars Conference of  several Christian universities.  The actual talk was not exactly like the rehearsal, so I had revised my presentation a bit to clean up some rough spots, but it gives the essentials of my talk.

The video will teach a lot about ENCODE's work and about the Genetic Entropy thesis.  Even though ENCODE is not specifically mentioned in the video, chromatin is the focus of 1 billion dollar ENCODE and encode-related projects.  This video has a lot of theology in it, but I hope you can look past it and learn something about Chromatin and how the DNA/Chormatin complex functions.

8,"We don't know the extent that a species line can vary their phenotype even without mutation but just through natural recombination of traits.  For example we see variation in kids of the same parent.  Now, if hypothetically there were two of each kind, and there was a lot of alleles different between mom and dad, we really don't know how this might affect phenotypes.

I for one was astonished at the Panthera genus and the hybrids formed:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aEL7Y6k_s6o/TcoA2yiSEaI/AAAAAAAAAU4/VYiqHaMRgf8/s1600/tigon.jpg

Or how about the varieties of Brassica:
https://kottke.org/13/09/the-magical-brassica-oleracea-plant

Well, I really don't care much about this topic.  For me, I think, ""all right so and so has identified a kind, how boring.""

So lots of creatures could be of the same kind, but they don't look like they are.  Hybridization might be able to establish that they are.  The problem is discriminating and saying some creature are NOT the same kind when they look similar enough.  

A lot of developmental pathways are under epigenetic control so even clonal creatures (like plants) with identical DNA may develop very differently.  I see that in plants I've cloned.

Here for example are genetically cloned plants that had very different developmental pathways triggered.  I suppose one could have mistaken them as being different species!

9,"&gt;So the ""major problem"" here was not highlighted.

My fault, I should have said, ""mRNA translation"" is the major problem, all the numerous steps have to be in place. Thank you for your criticism as I'm trying to put together teaching materials and this is the sort of feed back that is helpful.

&gt;The part about the exact steps of how aaRS hooks up an amino acid to tRNA was interesting.

That involved an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Now an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is itself a protein.  This is the chicken and egg paradox I alluded to here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/85uzut/is_the_end_of_the_rna_world_hypothesis_near/

The Acceptor, Peptidyl, Exit components are part of the 30S unit which in prokaryotes are made of:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic_small_ribosomal_subunit

&gt; It is a complex of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 19 

19 proteins!  The chicken and egg paradox again.

and the 40S in eukaryotes:

&gt;The eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S) .... is structurally and functionally related to the 30S subunit of 70S prokaryotic ribosomes.[1][2][3][4][5] However, the 40S subunit is much larger than the prokaryotic 30S subunit and contains many additional protein segments, as well as rRNA expansion segments.

Scroll down the list to see the list of proteins....

The problem is that translating an RNA into a protein is not an easy task and requires specialized machinery.  I was trying to convey how difficult the origin of a cellular reproduction system is that entails translating RNA into a protein.  

Yes, hypothetically there could be simpler replicators involving other chemicals, but that's not the point.  Why should a complex replicator evolve by itself anymore than a complex Rube-Goldberg machine mt. Rushmore evolve by itself.

This was intended to be a lead in to the problem of evolution spliceosome.

IF true then we would predict that there will not be multitudes of religions with a creator god in them because our prediction was that this God is gathering people together who are seeking a creator.

38,"/u/johnberea explains the microbial evolution argument best, so I'll leave it to him. Instead, Ill start listing other arguments.

1.Orphan genes and [conflicting gene flow](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jan/21/charles-darwin-evolution-species-tree-life) Falsify evolutionary theory. Universal common ancestry predicts a near perfect nested heirarchy, with organisms being similar to others in a fully consistent gene flow pattern leading back to a universal common ancestor. Orphan or taxonomically restricted genes are genes without detectable comparisons in other organisms.We find atleast around [10-30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5116166/)([more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716618)[sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590893/))in eukaryotes This would be directly expected under design, you would find expect to find unique features in my LG that you wouldn't find in an IPhone. Same with inconsistent gene flow, I would use the same code found in my iphone in my car, but not my computer for example.

Evolutionists try to account for this by invoking HGT as the biggest source for orphans. The problem with this is that HGT isn't common in multicellular eukaryotes. The tardigrade genome, for example, was the genome reported to supposedly have the highest amount of horizontally acquired genes at roughly 17% of the gene set. This, however, was latter shown false as only [4-5%](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=27173901) of the gene set is actually from HGT. The truly highest horizontally acquired gene set was from the [bdelloid rotifers,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632278/) at 8-9% with the same sequence uncertainty as the tardigrades. The problem only gets worse when you take in this quote from the study I just linked above
&gt;Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic animals that contain a **higher proportion of horizontally transferred, non-metazoan genes** in their genomes than typical of animals. **It has been hypothesized that bdelloids incorporate foreign DNA when they repair their chromosomes following double-strand breaks caused by desiccation. HGT might thereby contribute to species divergence and adaptation, as in prokaryotes.**

This means that the average number must be far less than 9% in most multicellular eukaryotes, bringing it far out of range for 10-30%. Another popular way for evolutionist to account for orphs are de novo evolution from non coding regions creating de novo genes.The problem with this is, We've never observed de novo gene evolution of genes even in microbes that have been able to acheive a cumulative population of 10^20. I'm top of that, very few sequences will create a folding and functioning protein needed for de novo genes to form. Robert saur [calculated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2199970) that only 1 in 10^63 would be able to do so in 92 amino acids. So even if evolution could form new proteins, it couldn't do so at a rate needed to account for even a good fraction of those genes.

I'm actually quite familiar with Van Til (don't really understand Clark tbh). Christian history and theology is a big hobby of mine (I'm a weird atheist, I know.). I've hung out on a lot of debate forums, and the general consensus was that modern presuppositionalism was somewhat mythical. Would you say there are very many of you guys or is it quite a minority position?

And yeah, when you look back at older internet stuff, it often seems really unconvincing and unpolished compared to what we have now. But I remember how glad we were to have what we did for niche topics. It's awesome how many more choices we have now.

54,"Sure.  When I was a naturalist I was philosophically a skeptic.  There's a bit of a disconnect there because you can't actually function as a skeptic.  It was at this stage that I found appealing other material that reinforced my skepticism.

For example: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9_o7NGTkJc

or

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JEFy-ZtEzg

I actually didn't have that resource when I was doing this.  What I did have was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_OlX7M5MLA

That guy is pretty much bonkers.  70% of what he said was just too wacky, or confusing, or foreign.  But then there is still some stuff in the cracks that I found intriguing because it reinforced my skepticism.  But that was an earlier time.  It's really all we had.  This [creationism] field of study has kind of exploded with the advent of the internet and we have better resources now, like the first guy I mentioned.

At this point I was basically like ""Everybody is just guessing.  Nobody has anything figured out.""

Then I became a Christian through non-naturalistic means.

Then I discovered stuff like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEOY4LNRMd8

https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Apologetics-Cornelius-Van-Til/dp/0875525113

So I didn't mean to confuse the issue of evolution and abiogenesis; I was just under the impression that this sub had a lot of doubts about evolution overall. I should have worded more carefully, sorry 'bout that. :)

If you'll allow me a moment, I'd like to explain why I think that New Atheism offers one of the best means of control — With the proliferation of the internet, it is easier than ever to find arguments against a literalist interpretation of religion, which makes it much harder to use religion to control the population as governments have for so long. I'm not saying this makes a religion untrue or trying to disrespect anyone's beliefs — however pretty much any government will use the dominant religion to its benefit.

New Atheism comes with its own set of beliefs — first and foremost a love of Science™ but without all the hard work. Instead, you get dogma fed to you from Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, etc. I'm sure you've seen r/atheists making petitions to raise taxes for NASA - I can't think of anything I'd like more if the taxes went to me. /u/stcordova has an excellent quote in the top post from scientists' on issues with the actual science, but most are not exposed to that.

Best of all, this system is self-sustaining since New Atheism frequently reinforces how intelligent and skeptical you are — you're infinitely smarter than anyone religious. The religious are frequently dehumanized and often considered delusional or mentally ill. You wouldn't want to be like one of those delusional people with an imaginary friend, would you? 

This also gives plenty of cause for war since you're saving those poor people from the evils of Islam.

I don't think that about religious people anymore, and as I got older I found the rhetoric against religious people so off-putting that it snapped me out of my blind belief and desire to be in the atheist echo chamber. That was a few years ago, but I still want to make sure all of my beliefs get a thorough re-examination. :)",1,1521858552,2018-03-23 22:29:12

&gt;

Thanks for finding these.This is the sort of thing that first made me question evolution, and I look forward to reading these more thoroughly.

&gt;
&gt;Without God, one would then look for evidence of what I LOOSELY term a black swan event, that is an event this not typical or ordinary, but rather extra ordinary.  The idea comes from finance and economic theory, and I borrowing it for the issues in biology:
&gt;
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory

I had actually never heard of that, but yes, I suppose that's what the few non-religious non-evolutionists are thinking of, although most of us don't seem to have much hope in finding it — not helped by the fact that no one is looking for it. Personally, I'm also open to a creation event from a deistic god or some other First Cause, or really wherever the evidence leads.

&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately the best evidence against evolution is not for laymen, but for someone with at least a year of biology and biochemistry under their belt. The evidence I have in mind is a molecular machine known as the Spliceosome:
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spliceosome

You're right that most of that went right over my head, but I will definitely share it with some of my more scientifically minded friends who are invested in sharing this sort of information with the public.
&gt;
&gt;Even die-hard evolutionists reluctantly admit, emergence of such a machine is a black swan event.  One evolutionist, Change Laura Tan, an Ivy League PhD, became a creationist after studying such systems.  She is now facing expulsion from her university after coming out.   Her essay is brutally hard to read and written for a PhD audience, but anyway here goes:
&gt;https://answersingenesis.org/biology/microbiology/information-processing-differences-between-bacteria-and-eukarya/

That one I actually understand a bit better lol, so there may be hope there. Although, there's no such thing as too much info — now that I know where to look, it's a lot easier to find someone to explain to me. 

&gt;
&gt;I fear she is at risk of going the way of my friend Caroline Crocker, PhD, former professor of biology who got expelled from 2 universities after she came to her senses about the lack of evidence for evolution. 
&gt;
&gt;I know first hand about academic persecution as it's a matter of public record of people trying to contact my professors at Johns Hopkins around 2008/2009 to get me expelled from grad school. Also a lab I was offered a position at was shut down by the admins until Ken Starr (famous prosecutor in the Clinton impeachment) intervened and re-opened the Lab (Robert Marks Evolution Informatics Lab).

It's a shame that holding a different view is something one can get fired for; I've seen the same thing happen to  academics whose field isn't even relevant to their view. It seems most common in academia where imo diverse views should be most welcome. Sure, everyone won't end up being right, but witch hunts aren't exactly great for new discoveries either. 

Odd for Ken Start to show up there, although I suppose I don't know anything about him except the Clinton trial. Best of luck to you and anyone brave enough to challenge the majority view. :)
&gt;
&gt;So I suggest modifying your question to ask, is the Origin of Life an ordinary event?  That's easier.  You won't have to learn as much biology.  If the origin of life is a black swan event then you can consider other questions such as Universal Common Ancestry from the first life.

Cheers, that would be much better than my current scattershot approach.
&gt;
&gt;Ok, for government manipulation, lets start with NASA.   A professor at my undergrad alma mater, George Mason signed this statement along with lots of others.  It discusses some money issues, but it has relevance to the origins of the universe which relates to the age of the Earth and fossil record:
&gt;http://homepages.xnet.co.nz/~hardy/cosmologystatement.html

That letter is really interesting and highlights a lot of problems in the scientific community that have only grown since it was written.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies. Funding comes from only a few sources, and all the peer-review committees that control them are dominated by supporters of the big bang. As a result, the dominance of the big bang within the field has become self-sustaining, irrespective of the scientific validity of the theory.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Giving support only to projects within the big bang framework undermines a fundamental element of the scientific method -- the constant testing of theory against observation. Such a restriction makes unbiased discussion and research impossible. To redress this, we urge those agencies that fund work in cosmology to set aside a significant fraction of their funding for investigations into alternative theories and observational contradictions of the big bang. To avoid bias, the peer review committee that allocates such funds could be composed of astronomers and physicists from outside the field of cosmology.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Allocating funding to investigations into the big bang's validity, and its alternatives, would allow the scientific process to determine our most accurate model of the history of the universe.

I couldn't agree more with your above paragraphs. I wish I could come up with something half so eloquent when people start their 'science is amazing and self-correcting' speech that is so common on reddit.
&gt;
&gt;Now as far as the science goes, unfortunately, you might have to roll up your sleeves and spend a lot of time learning lots of boring facts if you are THAT interested in examining the question.

I'm just dipping my toes in right now, but you never know! Thanks for giving me such a great start!
&gt;
&gt;Btw, I actually like atheists who are free thinkers.  I don't get along well with authoritarian types, even in my church.

Thank you, I far prefer actual free-thinking religious people than dogmatic atheists. Tbh I've actually gotten a bit more agnostic since making this alt — too much exposure to my own kind, I think. :P

My old professor's paper shows that for viruses, 7 mutations at different points of the genome occurred in the span of a few viral replication cycles, and this was repeatable. This is likely because the sleenium deficiency created preferred niches which the virus always mutated to take advantage of, and it then outcompeted the ancestral viruses. This is punctuated equilibrium: something happened, and 7 things changed in rapid succession due to the same stimulus.

In macroevolution, over the course of 200 Million Years, you would have this happen with variable frequency. For example, the Carboniferous period lasted 150 million years whereas the Permian only lasted ~50 million years.

Such a restriction makes unbiased discussion and research impossible. To redress this, we urge those agencies that fund work in cosmology to set aside a significant fraction of their funding for investigations into alternative theories and observational contradictions of the big bang. To avoid bias, the peer review committee that allocates such funds could be composed of astronomers and physicists from outside the field of cosmology.

&gt;Allocating funding to investigations into the big bang's validity, and its alternatives, would allow the scientific process to determine our most accurate model of the history of the universe.

Now as far as the science goes, unfortunately, you might have to roll up your sleves and spend a lot of time learning lots of boring facts if you are THAT interested in examining the question.

Btw, I actually like atheists who are free thinkers.  I don't get along well with authoritarian types, even in my church.

105,"I'm an evolutionist (my PhD project was focused on Immunology), so my view is likely skewed and might be better informed by having a creationist revise some of these points: but these are my impressions.

Generally, anti-evolution arguments don't offer evidence for creationism, but rather arguments *against Evolution.* This is mostly because what makes a concept a Theory is the inability to invalidate the concept through experimentation. Evolutionary Theory has not been invalidated despite experimentation, whereas Creationist Theory has not been invalidated because it is unfalsifiable: It refers to a specific, past, non-repeatable and fundamentally untestable concept.

That being said, arguments against evolution often focus on these concepts:

1. Evolutionary Theory doesn't offer an explanation for the first common ancestor's origin. Creationism does.
2. Evolutionary Theory's timeline is based on an inconsistent patchwork of dating techniques.
3. Macro evolution cannot be observed. 
4. New Genetic Information cannot be generated randomly.
5. The mathematics of genetic evolution don't check out.


My arguments against each of these points are as follows:

1. Evolutionary Theory doesn't need to explain the first ancestor's origin, that is a separate theory.
2. Yes, geological timelines are often wrong, but radiometric techniques are reliable.
3. Macro evolution cannot be observed *in our lifetimes*, but microevolution can be.
4. This claim is entirely false: Gene duplication, viral insertion, CRISPR, somatic hypermutation, and VDJ recombination are each examples of new genetic information being generated in a demonstrable mechanism. Several of these mechanisms can also effect the germ line.
5. I always struggle with this argument and don't have a solid enough grasp of the mathematics here to really argue on this point. If you're looking to have evidence against evolution, this is your best bet: But keep in mind, it's not easy to understand these arguments, and there's much math involved.",1,1521817058,2018-03-23 10:57:38

It is monstrously improbable according to realistic mathematical models and computer simulations.

Most (80% ?) of the genome has function, which would not be the case with an unguided process).

Observation of evolution in unicellular eukaryotes like malaria,  indicates that natural selection acting on random mutations cannot produce complex function systems.

Genetic entropy: Accumulating random mutations in the genome should eventually destroy a species. 

As for **common descent** itself (by whatever mechanism) my scientific reason for not believing it is the fact that biologists are unable to construct a coherent family tree linking all life to a common ancestor.

This article of his sparked a lot of controversy, people like Eugenie Scott and Richard Dawkins responded to it, but they've missed the point entirely (pay attention to the Head Monkey analogy), as you can see from his responses (I could not find them online, but they're there in the book ""The deniable Darwin and other essays"")",1,1521814330,2018-03-23 10:12:10
110,"Evolution is a mechanism not in conflict with creation. What we don't know is exactly how life started. The bible offers an explanation but honestly there is no physical evidence to support divine interference. Or the physical evidence does just that but creation is disguised as natural occurrence reflected in what we can measure and test.

You don't have to be a christian to believe we were created and I don't know if there's enough evidence to support any government conspiracy. If the government were some malevolent force they would want us to not question the world around us and more likely use faith as a control mechanism. So it doesn't make sense that would encourage us to deny faith or dogma and question everything and test everything with natural sciences.

The reason media and culture expresses certainty in the origins of life being shear happenstance is that it offers them a feeling of intellectual superiority over the opposition. Perhaps it's also frees them from responsibility of their sins, however they manifest. Perhaps it's nihilism.

Concerning fossil record, I think the evidence is right there if you want to look into it. There are flora and fauna completely alien to present day life and science has proposed they are ancient and contradict biblical timelines, which is gathered by recording the ""begats"".

The problem with creationists disregarding things like carbon dating, geological sedimentation and fossils is they don't seem to understand how many years and how many times these things were repeatedly tested before they became accepted forms of studying the natural world. Even something like glacier core samples throws off the biblical timeline completely and that isn't a very complex method of analysis. They literally just count the rings.

114,"&gt;I really don't understand why any of this matters

If the Christian God is real it changes the way people should live their lives.  Since people are not usually 100% sure He is real or not real, then I think that still has bearing on how people would live their lives.  Lots of decision about how we live are made with not 100% validation of what is real or true.

Big decisions are sometimes made on very low probability events, like say the probability of getting in a fatal car accident when the roads are slick.  Suppose someone concludes he has a 1% chance of dying if he went out and drove somewhere for some non-urgent matter.   I know I was faced with comparable decisions on whether to take a joy ride in an airplane given the weather or other flying considerations.  

After an acquaintance in my flight school was killed, it changed the way I did business with low probability events.  Here is the sad account of my acquaintance.  The last time I spoke to him was on the radio.   We were flying around the airport together one night.  He overheard me announcing my position as I approach for a night landing.  We chatted for less than 30 seconds on the airport frequency at Shenandoah airport, and somehow it slipped out of my mouth that had to lady passengers whom I was taking sight seeing.  After we figured out where each of us were around the airfield at night he said, ""I have a visual.""  I laughed.

This was the sad news a few months later:
http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/85096.html

There were Epistemic issues involved in John Zachary and Michael Lease's death, namely the uncertainties about aircraft performance given the hot weather conditions.  Word got to me that my fellow flying student Andrew R. came along for the ride with , but decided to step out of the plane after it landed, because he felt it could not safely take off again.   Andrew R. survived.  He weighed the epistemic values and potential rewards and payoffs.  He erred on the side of caution.  I'm told he had to suffer the sad sight of seeing his two friends burn to death.

That influenced how I view the epistemic certainties in the Creation and Evolution controversy, it's not just about the odds of being right or wrong, but what will happen to someone's soul if there is a Christian God -- as in heaven or hell.

117,"&gt; Given this, why should it bother creationists that we see semi-nested hierarchies of living things, along with significant discordances?

It bothered me.  Actually Michael Denton was an Old Earth Creationist and then became an atheist when he went to medical school and was in the dissection room observing the organs and limbs of humans and apes.  Eventually Denton became and agnostic and wrote an ID friendly book when he concluded Evolution was a theory in crisis.  So he sort of went not quite full circle in his views.

I see lot of the discordances, but they aren't always blatant.  There are former creationists who are became ID proponents, like Mike Gene (his pen name), who felt if God wanted to make creation blatantly obvious, he wouldn't have made something like a chimp.

Now, in the man-made world of designs, there are hierarchical designs all over the place, but they don't replicate. Further, phylogenetic relationship in species lines do create nested hierarchies -- like the genealogy of Abraham.  There are nested hierarchies that begin with his two sons, Ishmael and Issaac, and this is strongly supported by genetic evidence, aka the Abraham Modal Haplotype:

http://abraham-modal-haplotype.wikia.com/wiki/Abraham_modal_haplotype

But, when one really scrutinizes the data, one sees that hierarchies defined by orphan genes and TRG's aren't generated through a process of replication since TRGs have no traceable ancestor, and neither do they make any mechanistic sense in terms of common descent.  The classic example are the TRGs in the eukaryotic spliceosome.  I shared this info with a Christian Darwinist pre-med biology sophomore, and he became a creationist in one hour!

But, given that it's in my nature to be skeptical and curious and ask ""why"", I kept asking.  Well, when I started doing my investigative reporting work at the NIH, and I saw all the cruel things we do to lab creatures (like changing their genomes and deliberately giving them birth defects), I began to appreciate and be grateful God made creatures similar to us.  I was wondering why I had to go through bomb and firearms security screening each time I went to the NIH.  The rumor is animal rights activists have been terrorizing researchers and have killed and injured several researchers around the world.

God ordained that human life cannot be sustained without the death, the spilling of blood, of innocent creatures.  Biology seems a picture of Christian doctrine of the Lamb of God.   It extends not just to food, but to scientific understanding of our biology.  We could not understand ourselves without the sacrifice of innocent animals.  

Also, the patterns of difference and similarity are HIGHLY optimized to help us elucidate protein structure and function.  I definitely saw that by studying protein sequence alignments and identifying key functional motifs.  Darwinists will say that this is ""conserved"" due to selection, but that won't work if the fossil record and life are young. The patterns of similarity and difference are VERY deliberate, imho, optimized for scientific discovery, just like our Privileged Planet.

It looks to me, genetically anyway that were are closer to the coelacanth fish than a coelacanth fish is to other fish like the stickleback.  I found this also true with mRNA data, etc.

Yet taxonomically the coelacanth skeleton looks a lot closer to a stickleback.  See for yourself:

So how would you classify these creatures.  Would you put coelacanth fish and humans in the same group or would you put coelacanth fish and stickleback fish in the same group.  In terms of skeletal structure, I'd put the fish together.  However, evolutionary biologists and their phylogenetic methods would say we should group the coelacanth and human together.

Compare the skeletons of a tuna, a coelacanth and pigeon.  Which look more similar?  However, compare the genomes, and it's not quite so clear. Compare individual genes and they conflict.  Compare orphans and it's totally confused.

1.  ""An alternative solution is to suggest that each selective death kills many mutant genes, so that one needs fewer selective deaths to balance the number of mutations. This implies that selection occurs in such a way that there is an interaction between mutants. If an individual only dies if it has ten or more mutants, then we cannot simply predict the fitness of a ten-fold heterozygote from the fitness of single heterozygotes. Models of selection of this sort were introduced by Sved, Reed, and Bodmer (1967), King (1967), and Milkman (1967) to deal with segregational load problems, and these papers may be consulted for more details.""

138,"See u/SadNot's explanation on synergistic epistasis.  [This paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12195/full) goes into more detail on how soft selection is proposed as a solution to the mutation load problem, and is much easier to read than Kondrashov's:

1.  ""a possible resolution that avoids discarding purifying selection in favor of an alternative such as stabilizing selection is provided by the possibility that much selection is competitive in nature, that is, there is “soft selection.” ... Soft selection implies that the absolute mean fitness of a population is dependent solely on the availability of the resources for which individuals compete.""

The author notes that in humans there won't be much variation in deleterious load from one person to the next. With a population size of 20k and 16.7% of the genome subject to purifying selection:

1.  ""Using values of π = 0.001 and N = 20,000, and a very generous estimate of 5 × 10\^8 sites under selection, we obtain σ_ln(w)pur of 0.0088, which is again very small, although potentially observable.""

But I can't make sense of why the author sees reduced variation in fitness as a good thing.  This just means that instead of some going downhill much faster than others, everyone is going downhill at about the same rate.  Yes, everyone isn't drastically more or less fit than their neighbors.  But everyone is still worse off than their parents.  This process can't continue indefinitely.",1,1521668280,2018-03-21 17:38:00

Your scientism?  Nothing as far as I know.  at least I have not heard anybody justify it to me yet.

Science is good and useful and scientists can contribute to society.  Scientism is unjustifiable, and harmful to society.

If I had to wager a guess, I would say it is defended with emotion.  I say that because of the emotionally charged language.  (""Keenly"" ""pesky"" ""/s"")  But there's nothing behind that language that would actually justify scientism.

As far as I'm concerned, it's just another justification of an earlier postulate.  Romans 2:1 is a postulate we have had for a while.  it is testable.

Multiverse is speculative and pretty much untestable and goes against a lot of science based on expected statistical behavior (vs. unexpected behavior expected to practically never happen).  Given all those negatives, I was pointing out it doesn't help solve life's problems.  So, it's essentially a worthless theory that appears to be promoted not for it actual science but avoidance of the possibility of intelligent design.

As I pointed out, straightforward interpretations of Quantum Mechanics lead to the hypothesis of God.  One does not have to be religious to accept this possibility.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/82osbh/laws_of_physics_especially_qm_suggests_the/

From a practical standpoint, the God Hypothesis at least offers some individuals a possibility of hope.  Multiverse, in addition to being possibly wrong, untestable, offers no hope.

158,"&gt;some systems necessitate an extremely rare set of conditions in nature

Some systems as a matter of principle will necessitate SOME extremely rare conditions but not ALL.   Example, it's extremely rare to roll 7 in a dice(craps) game 6 times in a row.  It will happen on average about every 15,625 such attempts.

But there are limits to the number of attempts a universe can generate.   If one has too few attempts it won't happen in a universe.  

One then must resort, like Koonin, to Unseen, Infinite, essentially all powerful set of multiverses.  It is, in effect a Deity, except this Deity isn't a conscious intelligence.

Without us being Omniscient, we can't resolve the question formally one way or another.

The other issue, is that if one will invoke multiverses, then even if a miracle happened by God's power, one could always hold out hope it was the result of the multiverse.  So, even if a miracle happened, multiverse provides a way for people to remain unconvinced.  That of course is their choice, and I respect that.  But it's not for me.  At some point multiverse simply won't help me deal with life's problems, starting with the problem of finding meaning and purpose.

I gave up watching after he talked about angular momentum.  It wasn't worth my time at that point.  There is an angular momentum problem in the solar system, but he framed it so poorly it was unworkable.

How do we know when we have a good argument? We debate evolutionists in venues where each side can debate for days, weeks, etc.

Some of the better examples, unfortunately are technically difficult, they aren't trivial.  Evolutionists prefer to argue over similarity of skeletons, they usually don't like going into the biochemical realm.  

What would be a good system that can be talked about and make a joke about in 1 or 2 minutes like Hovind?  I don't know any.  I converted a pre-med Christian Darwinist into a Christian Creationist in one hour.  I used the spliceosome as evidence.   How many people will have the patience to study the spliceosome!!!

I suspect people flock to Hovind because they want simplistic answers.

Contrast Hovind to the far more scholarly ID videos, Unlocking the Mystery of Life or Programming of Life.  Those videos won't get ANY laughs, but they are technically far more accurate.

If I could get creationists to just take time to seriously study this 4-minute video, then would be on more solid ground.  They could ask evolutionists to give detailed reasons why such a system should evolve:

My main criteria so far has been belief in a knowable, non-contingent being who existed before the universe, and who causes the universe to exist as an act of His will.  This being also justifies all beliefs.  All religions who claim God is unknowable, or who claim that any being that it is right to call ""god"" is the sum total of all matter and energy and knowledge *within* the universe... I stick in the naturalism box.  That is, everything that is knowable is knowable through observing nature.  For me, naturalism is any belief that relies exclusively on observing nature to get to ""T""ruth.  If it claims to find God in nature then it is trying to get to ""T""ruth through observing nature.

What's left, I stick in the Creator-God box.  As far as I have found, there are only the three Abrahamic religions in that box.  From there you can do your due diligence on each one.  Islam does not have a redeemer to ""clothe"" you after you realize you are naked so it does not have a solution for my ""naked"" problem.  Judaism works into the history of Christianity, obviously.  Jesus tells the parable of the wedding guests who show up to the wedding without the proper attire, so they are a consistent feature of my ""naked"" problem.  Although Judaism is not the answer to it.  You get lingo in the bible like ""put on Christ"" or ""clothed in righteousness"".  So Jesus is the answer to the ""naked"" problem.",1,1521421660,2018-03-18 21:07:40

235,"I had to work with a guy who annoyed me.  He would not shut up about Jesus and he would not shut up about how crazy he was about his wife.  I had grown up in the subculture, so I knew how to talk the lingo.  But I didn't really want anybody to know about that.  I was in a bit of a pickle.  Becuase when it was just he and I, then I was comfortable to talk the lingo and generally do the Christian subculture thing around him.  That was safe enough because there was nobody around to judge me.

The problem was, he didn't care who knew.  He would talk to anybody.  He would also drag me into his conversations with other people.  If a person would try to escape the situation (because that didn't want to talk about it) then I would try to escape as well because I didn't wan them to think I was weird.  He was also a ""man's man"".  That was kind of weird to me too.  I thought of church as a place for women and for weak men.  He didn't really fit the ""Christian"" mold as far as I knew.

[bit of backstory here]
Within the past 4 months of meeting that guy, I had become a philosophical skeptic.  Although I consciously decided to behave as though skepticism were not true because I still wanted to believe that math worked and the laws of physics would continue to operate in the future as they have operated in the past.  I also wanted to pretend I had a rational justification for morality because that seemed societally expedient.  So, philosophically skeptic, but not behaviorally.

It was also about this time that I encountered the infamous and much-hated Kent Hovind.  His seminars did not persuade me that he was right.  But I was persuaded that his beliefs were as intellectually satisfying as any other beliefs.  (That is to say, I thought everybody held their epistemology together with bailing wire and duct tape.  I know I did.  What he believed was not *more* dubious.  It was just *equally* dubious.)

I had also been going to church at this time.  This was not out of the ordinary for me.  I had always gone to church off and on.  We were going through the sermon on the mount.  I don't know how much you know about Christianity, but at the beginning of Genesis, Adam and Eve are caught naked and afraid.  God makes animal skins to cover them.  This theme of being naked and afraid runs throughout the entire bible.  The overarching principle is that when you admit that you are naked, that's when God will step in and ""cover"" you.

This theme was coming out in the sermon on the mount study.  In that sermon, Jesus lists quite a large number of things that prove we are naked.  For example he raises the definition of lust so high that everybody is guilty.  He raises the definition of murder so high that everybody is guilty. etc... 

Couple this with the thing I had already said (where I knew I was philosophically/epistemologically naked, plus the observation that this nutjob Hovind was neither more, nor less ""naked"" than I was and pretty much all the groundwork is laid.

Anyway, back to the story.  One night I could not sleep.  The verse ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anybody hears my voice and opens the door, I will come and dine with him, and he with Me.""

I go over to this co-worker's place and wake him up about midnight.  I was going to try to have a rational, intellectual conversation with him.  I didn't even get both feet inside the door and I started crying.  I was in no condition to have any kind of conversation.  Between breaths I managed to get out ""I don't know what it is, but what you've got, I want!""

He prayed for me

I felt at peace and comforted in a way that I had not felt before.  As it were, no longer ""naked"".  The next morning, when I woke up it felt like I was ""home"".  I also had a very strong belief that the bible is authoritative and accurately preserved.  That was most peculiar.  I had never thought that before.

Different people may have a different experience.  But for me, I did not get there through rationalism or empiricism or anything.  I used rationalism and empiricism to prove that I was ""naked"" --as it were.  Then that's when God ""clothed"" me.  If you try to get there by pedaling the bike yourself, you just never get there.",1,1521416653,2018-03-18 19:44:13

For example, he asks what came first, bacteria or termites? He says termites can't digest wood without the bacteria.  Well for that matter a lot of animals can't live to well without a micro-biome of bacteria.  But evolutionists have said bacteria arrived on the planet first, so the problem of termite digestion doesn't falsify evolution.

One might get a good laugh, or find the fact interesting, but let creationist try to make that argument to anyone with some biological knowledge and he'll be shot down.  

Next he ridiculed the Big Bang.  The Big Bang has a LOT of problems, but one difference between physicists and evolutionary biologists is that physicists have ushered in the technological age with their understanding of nature.

257,"&gt;Special revelation could not be trusted to provide an accurate history of the world.

The issue for many is that ""how do we know it was special revelation?""  If it doesn't square with the facts, or if we're not the one to witness the miracles with our own eyes, it's simply hard to believe it is true.

For myself, when I thought perhaps that I had seen miracles of answered prayer in Jesus name, I thought it risky to be an atheist in case there indeed the Christian God was real. I then considered the possibility that life could arise by itself beginning with Pasteur's experiments.  Since then, it only became more convincing that it was most un-natural for random soups of molecules to evolve to the first cell, and then a cell to evolve to fish, and then a fish to evolve to a bird.  

I think, on many levels the issue of the youth of the Earth and Universe are not as easy to argue as the design of life.    There is a simple reason for this.  The universe looks grand and powerful.  It's hard to believe something so grand hasn't been around for ever.  In fact up until the discovery of the so-called background microwave radiation, most thought the universe was eternal!

I actually don't believe the facts are evident.  Most of the necessary facts are hidden, and it's only by God's grace eyes are opened to the truth.   I sometimes think for example,  ""what if Astronaut Charles Duke didn't come into my life and tell me of the miracles he'd seen worked in the name of Jesus, like a blind girl healed at a prayer service?""  It was just enough to get me through the dark nights in my life, and then I realized a few miracles happened in our family, but I was too overwhelmed by other things to notice.  What if I didn't have scientific training to at least be able to understand basic books on origin of life.  What if we didn't have data on geology and astronomy?  So many things just seemed to be available.  It wasn't easy to find the facts, but they were there as if God left them for us in 21st century.

So I think, people will accept the Bible because God has done something in their lives that gives them faith.   It has less to do with what the prevailing theories of the age of the Earth are. 

Regarding the rejection of Bible as historical fact, it has way more to do than the age of the Earth.  Consider passages in Ezra and Daniel regarding the Kings of Persia.  To this day, I find those passages highly problematic from an evidential standpoint.  One might believe them because one believes Jesus rose from the dead and Jesus was the fulfillment of the scriptures that include Daniel and Ezra.  But then why should someone believe Jesus rose from the dead?

Well, it became more believable to me that the Bible was inspired as I found more evidence of Noah's flood and the youth of the fossil record.  Though we haven't resolved the problem of distant starlight, there are enough anomalies in astronomy that demand reconsideration of basic physical theories.",1,1521360153,2018-03-18 04:02:33

Quote from the essay intro:

""In all religious philosophies, God is the original person, Who creates all else. If we were to count things, then God would represent 1. In Vedic philosophy, additionally, all that is created is also a part of God, Who is then described as the complete truth. In effect, since God is the complete truth, everything that follows is a partial truth. Similarly, since God is the original truth, everything that follows is a relative truth compared to the original truth. The partial truth represents a fraction of God, and the relative truth represents an order or succession among the fractions, which can be counted as 1, 2, 3, etc. Two ideas—(1) that God is the origin, and (2) God is the whole truth—can thus be used to construct a theory of natural numbers and fractions, which this post discusses. Once this foundation is established, then we also talk about other types such as complex and irrational numbers.

I suppose there are two burdens to shift.

1) Demonstrating that the bones are young

2) Demonstrating that the samples were contaminated

1)  The burden lies on young earth proponents here, obviously.  And I accept that the C14 tests dating these 14 separate dinos to a young age (even coupled with separate studies about tissue decay which argue for a young age) do not overturn the data of other radiometric dating methods and shift the burden to those who believe in an old earth.  But they do constitute a very good argument against it, an argument which gains strength with every subsequent test.  What if hundreds of dinos with soft tissue yield dates of 22,000-39,000 years? 

2) Here the burden is with those who claim there was contamination, surely.  I don't think the burden has been shifted here, even in this one case (mosasaur), let alone the other 13 cases.  They are simply *assuming* contamination, not demonstrating it.

Yes, you were right. I checked the comment thread and I remember now, the point I was trying to make is that it seemed to me your mathematical extrapolation was faulty if gain of function mutations could be observed at all in mammals. Whether such mutations are common is less immediately relevant, I think.

It was the no evidence bit that bothered me :)

&gt;Domestication thus generally comes at a cost, as deleterious mutations can accumulate in the genome. This had already been shown for rice and dogs. Horses now provide another example of this phenomenon.

I don't get why this is a ""similar comment"" in any way. We were talking about loss vs gain of information, not mutational load...?

&gt;My issue with evolution is that it's incredibly slow at creating sequences of nucleotides (either through modification or de novo) that have a new biochemical function. A gene duplication is just copying an existing sequence. If that duplicated gene subsequently mutated to have a new function then I would count that as a gain in information.

If I have a sequence ABC which digests starch quite well and that becomes a sequence ABCABC which digests starch better, in what way is that not a ""sequence of nucleotides with a new biochemical function""?

[This paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000310) lists several places where variants lead to different traits in dogs.  Some are mutations that caused loss of function while others are of unknown origin:

1.  ""A 167-bp deletion at the 3' end of the R-spondin-2 (RSPO2) gene is strongly
associated with wire hair and ""furnishings"", the latter being the moustache and eyebrows
characteristically seen, for instance, in the schnauzer (Figure 4)... Coats expressing only pheomelanin develop when Mc1r is nonfunctional
and therefore unable to produce eumelanin. Coats expressing only eumelanin occur via two mechanisms: recessive black coats are
observed when the agouti protein is nonfunctional. Dominant black coats occur when a derived ß-defensin protein competitively inhibits the
agouti protein. Several dog breeds exhibit complete or partial absence of pigmentation. For instance, Karlsson et al. mapped a locus for
white-spotting to a 102-kb haplotype on CFA 20 in a region that spans a single gene; microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF),
which is crucial for melanocyte migration. Two potential mutations were identified, one of which is a SINE insertion that may disrupt
transcription.""

Each gene that humans might have homology with a typical bacterium likely has Post Translantional Modifications (glycolisation, phosphorylation, etc.) that turbocharge eukaryotic function and makes them difference fairly significant with added function, making the individual amino acid residues important.  Plus in eukaryotes, the DNA is used in a 3D regulatory function, celled the 4D nucleome.  Oh, that's the other thing, prokaryotes don't deal with nucleome.

Take for example Topoisomerase in prokaryotes, vs.  humans.  Human topoisomerases have a lot of phosphorylation modifications that are made real time.  Same for all of their proteins.   Eukaryotic proteins are like miniature RAM modules.  Read (binding proteins), write (kinases), erase (phosphatase) mechanisms have to be in place to make use of the RAM on the topoisomerase (and all other proteins with phosphorylations).  Lenski's examples is pathetic.  

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/367/1602/2540.full.pdf

For example, they had two groups of mice. One group was forced to study how to solve a maze, then the other did nothting.  They then killed the mice 6 hours later and examined their brains.  The brains of the mice that studied had twice as much phosphorylation on their proteins!  Ergo, the RAM on these proteins is significant.  Nothing like this happens in the prokaryotic world since prokaryotes don't implement nervous systems.  So even aside from Orphan genes, even just tallying the differences in homologous genes between humans and bacteria, there is a lot of functional difference.  So, going from a brainless creature (like prokaryotic bacteria, or eukaryotic yeast) to a thinking one (like a mouse or human) one has to reformat a large fraction of homologous genes.  And we're not even talking glycolisation (which is another layer of RAM on 50% of the proteins in humans).

307,"&gt;Because I'm in a bit of a rush today, I'm just going to repost another comment I made on this topic, that is quite relevant:

&gt;I'm always highly skeptical of any attempt to disprove, or for that matter prove, evolution through mathematical arguments alone.

&gt;The fact is evolution is a hugely complicated process, involving countless genomes, populations, and organisms, all coming together to form the patterns that we simplify into mutation + selection = the life we see today. It's something that simply can't be distilled into a simple mathematical formula.

&gt;Now if you just wanted to know the basics of X mutations in Y time = Z divergence, then that's pretty simple. But the problem is there are a lot of other factors that need to be considered. And in reality, most of those factors are not understood to the point where we can punch them into some all inclusive formula.

&gt;For example, these points are all quite contentious, subjective, unknown, and/or imprecise:

&gt;How long it takes for a mutation to become fixed. This would differ based on population sizes, breeding rates, and selective pressure. Not to mention there isn't a clear divide between ""fixed"" and ""not fixed"".

&gt;How many mutations can be fixed at a time. In a population a number of mutations would be occurring. In sexually reproducing organisms a number of them would be spreading throughout the population at once.

&gt;The precise number of positive, neutral, and negative mutations that occur in organisms. A lot of the creationist arguments make the assumption that very few positive mutations occur. Some even go as far as to say that every non-positive mutation must be negative. This is usually based on the small number of mutations that have obvious effects, like being able to digest nylon, rather than an honest consideration of mutations having minor, much less obvious positive effects.

&gt;The precise number of positive, neutral, and negative mutations that need to occur in organisms. For example, we know that humans and chimps differ by about 35 million base pairs. But we can't say which of these were positive, negative, or neutral. Furthermore, it's highly subjective exactly how many of the changes between us could be considered positive, negative, or neutral.

&gt;The rates of evolutionary change between larger, slower breeding organisms. Applying the rates of HIV evolution to mammals is obviously wrong to begin with.

&gt;**Creationist nonsense, where they talk about genetic information, function, specified complexity ect. as some kind of measurable trait in the genome, when they have no way of measuring it. If you can't specifically measure these things, you can't use them in a calculation.**

(bold) How can they get away with this? Even Richard Dawkins admits it: 

""Everything about biology has become almost a branch of information technology because DNA is so exactly like a computer language. That was implicit in Watson and Crick in 1953, but somehow it’s become increasingly obvious.""
source: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/11/richard-dawkins-interview-twitter-controversy-genetics-god

This kind of objection is fueled either by ignorance or by bias - when ID proponents talk about information in the DNA, they're not using some fuzzy language to describe chemical reactions, they're actually talking about digital code; one that is orchestrated through organic compounds (instead of inorganic ones, as it happnes in Hard Drives). This is not hard to understand, nor is this knowledge only in ID books, it is all over the place, from science magazines, to scientific articles, etc.:

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/dna-could-store-all-worlds-data-one-room

324,"&gt;At the heart of any system you'll encounter a tautology or something akin to a self-referential or circular premise. At least if we're adhering to standard logic. This may be what you mean when you write 'insular'. However, the same could be said about standard logic. Men smarter than us have been chewing on this for millenia, and one of the more recent forerunners was only able to assert 'I think, therefore I am'. Prior to that, Socrates, among others, could similarly only be certain that they knew nothing. At some point, you do have to make a leap of faith, or formally commit to adopt and adhere to a system. While this may seem like a big jump, it's difficult for us to define and exchange information without it.

I am pretty sure that your use of tautology does not actually make sense in this case.  Tautologies only are viable in situations where they are necessarily true, in that they cannot be false.  This requires outside argumentation much of the time.  Thus, the bible verse referenced does not stand on its own.  

Further, the referenced verse doesn't actually seem to be talking about how someone would need proof of God, rather it's talking about how the Old Testament God's or Jesus's actions appear foolish to an outsider.  

&gt;If you're interested, you can read more about this problem here and here among other places. I also found this article from ICR. In that last link, I took particluar interest to their brief explanation, as well as Dr. Jason Lisle's example:

But Dr. Jason clearly seems to rely on other arguments, like the moral argument, or the claim that nothing abstract can be objective.  The issue I have here is that this is blatantly an assumption.  It would seem to me that logic is derived from the physical world.  Further, there is no reason the physical world's constants would change randomly, that's just a claim that has no support behind it.  The moral argument makes a similar error on its own, since you'd need additional argumentation to argue reality is not compatible with objective morals, but otherwise I don't subscribe to moral realism being an emotivist.

If we set aside for the sake of argument the aforementioned distinction between a tautology, defined as 'a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form' and your stated point that the logic I've used is 'circular' (which I don't dispute as a way to describe a tautology), if the conclusion isn't arbitrary, there's nothing wrong. 

To speak plainly, it seems like you're making a claim that we can't accept an argument that a claim is true if the reasoning used to argue the claim is shown to be circular. This is Hume's problem of induction. Instead of saying 'nuh uh,' I'm pointing out that if that's your acceptance criteria, we can't know if anything is true, let alone agree on what true means, or derive meaning from anything else. A practical example is our exchange. It's in English. We've implicitly agreed to use a common language or system to exchange information within. While we haven't defined all of our terms yet, if we're going to assert anything beyond what Socrates ventured to, it's going to require an initial faith and belief in or agreement to operate within some sort of framework, system or construct.

352,"Your right with c14, however the original preflood ratio would've been around 1/128T so that amounts to about 7 half lives which means that we wouldn't expect dates lower than 40,110 in flood or pre flood rock (if we were calibrating with present day atmospheric values). As for postflood rock, [this](http://www.grisda.org/origins/21066.htm) paper estimates that c14 would've reached 95% equilibrium after about 1125 years, i would think a lot of regional variations in c14 could greatly effect calibrated ages so I would think we could expect higher ages from c14.

But as for soft tissue, I might've misunderstood you, were you simply talking about proteins and cells like hemoglobin and DNA? In that case, I would think the immediate thermal heat from the rapid fossilization would've accelerated soft tissue but I'm not sure by how much.

* Masses of c12 is removed from the biosphere by the flood. Production rates of c14 remain constant, meaning that pre-flood samples will have a much higher c12:c14 ratio than post-flood samples.

Would that be a fair summary?

But if the flood is a catastrophic ""cut-off"" point in c12 levels, wouldn't you expect the ""spread"" of c14-dated samples to run from 40k to 39k for antedeluvian samples, then a huge gap, and then 5k to 0 for postdeluvian samples?

&gt;but it did both of these, so I don't see the argument here

You seem to be assuming a kind of conveniently subtle erosion which degrades the molecules a little but leaves otherwise remarkably well preserved proteins. I find that odd.

Surely, if proteins are found inside of bones which were themselves not significantly eroded, we shouldn't expect the rate at which proteins degrade to be affected?",1,1520935075,2018-03-13 05:57:55
355,"Sorry for not getting to this earlier, I've been a bit occupied the past couple of days.
&gt;Don't you mean c12? Wouldn't an increase in atmospheric c14 have made stuff look younger? (and how does c13 feature in this?)

Sorry and I was errored in my explanation. The way carbon dating works is by comparing the ratio of atmospheric c14/c12 (1c14 atom to 1 trillion c12) to the ratio found in your organism, so c13 doesn't factor anywhere here because its irrelevant. but also, I meant that there would've been a decrease in preflood c12 due to the flood. We find 6820 metric tons of carbon buried in the form of fossil fuels and fossils which is about 175 time the amount of organic matter we have living today, combine this with about 20 trillion metric tons of sedimentary carbonate within the geological record and we see evidence for much higher levels of c12  in the past in the atmosphere that would've greatly increased the apparent age of fossils. calculating for this, the current ratio of c14/c12 in the atmosphere is 1 in 1 trillion, but add the amount of extra c12 and the atmospheric ratio goes up to about 1 in 128T or about [7 half](http://www.creation-science-prophecy.com/C14c.htm) lives. 

So to use an example, carbon dating is only accurate to about 50k (if we're calibrating using current atmospheric ratios) years or a c14/c12 ratio of about 1/743. However, if we calibrate this to the preflood ratio of only 1/128T, then 50k shrinks to approximately 14k years.
&gt;Which is easy to check stratigraphically, btw (Correct me if I'm misrepresenting the YEC position here).

Attempt to eliminate contamination before testing.  As I understand it, this is standard procedure before each test.  Of course, mistakes happen, but as the number of tests giving ranges below 50,000 years increases, the likelihood that contamination is the reason grows less and less.

Not at all. At the heart of any system you'll encounter a tautology or something akin to a self-referential or circular premise. At least if we're adhering to standard logic. This may be what you mean when you write 'insular'. However, the same could be said about standard logic.

&gt;By what measure do you measure a teaching of Christianity to be morally wrong? By what measure are you basing it?

I am not personally, but a moral realist using intuitive argumentation can fairly easily reach a conclusion that X in Christianity feels wrong, which means that either A) there is an underlying reason that it is wrong that is not immediately evident or B) it's not wrong, Christianity is wrong.

* On science? ""It is wrong because science says so.""

And they eject that 1 person very quickly.

Go into a casino. Play a few hands, not counting cards. Then double down on a 18. Hell, double down on anything higher than a 13, they'll probably nail you.

You will be ejected immediately. They know what this strategy looks like. They know how to shut it down before you can make real profit from it -- because that's their money.

In order to clean up counting cards, you need to shift your bet and the pattern will be based on deck burn. They normally prevent this by not dealing through the whole deck.

As for why I have my doubts: $30,000 profit on a $10 table would require thousands of won games -- that would be a marathon session, at 1 to 3 hands per minute, suggesting 5 hours of play assuming you win every hand, I suspect 10 - 20 times that based on the slim advantage offered, then probably doubled again in the time it takes to cook the deck. So, you would have to be playing on a heavier table.

The numbers don't add up. Either they knew you were counting and let you, which is *not* the normal Vegas experience, or the entire thing was a setup.

Frankly, I'm still betting on the latter. But hey, I don't mind if a bunch of Christians lose their shirts in Vegas -- not my problem.",1,1520888392,2018-03-12 16:59:52

Yes, I don't think I've ever heard such an argument from anyone other than a creationist.  I'm not sure how you would realistically justify a moral system from evolution either.  

Your claim is also fairly vague.  If the moral teachings of Christianity are wrong, you should discard them anyway.  This sounds more like you're claiming that if Christianity is false there is no morality, which makes two pretty general errors:  It's an argument from the convenience of having claims of what is morally correct rather than what is actually true, and it assumes that creationism is the only viable form of Christianity (which is clearly false).  

Ethical arguments don't rely on evolution, they rely primarily on logic.  

&gt;Are you willing to say that no one considers evolution as a moral guide?

I'm sure someone does, but it's such a minor demographic of evolutionists that I don't think it warrants anything near what you're making it out to be.  It's not a necessary position for agreeing that the theory of evolution is correct, nor is it a common one.  ",1,1520886693,2018-03-12 16:31:33

414,"Probably freshman college level philosophy.

first I came to the conclusion that global skepticism is the only epistemology that doesn't dismantle itself.

Then I learned about other stuff that dismantles itself like naturalistic cosmogonies.  So biological evolution is somewhere in that bag, but it's not really a prominent part for me at this stage.

The important thing for me at this point was the way that skepticism was bearing up under scrutiny.

once I got to that point, the rest was really a non-issue.  Philosophically, I already believed that all epistemologies have to take a mulligan on the diallelus.  I already believed that the scientific method can not be foundational because the scientific method can not be used to validate the scientific method.  (because that's circular)  So what's if founded on?  faith? an affinity to it?  Pragmatism?  People who use it understand this.  It's common knowledge that ""science"" can not get you to truth.  It only hopefully gets you closer to truth.  But taking that position is also a truth claim.  What's *that* truth claim founded on?

When I realized that everybodys naturalistic truth-claims are a snow-job, held together with bailing wire and duct tape (not just those of biologists), that's when it was first possible to look critically.

If you are trying to get to the truth (of anything) using sheer brainpower and naturalistic observation then you probably won't get there.  This includes using your brainpower to compare/contrast the evo/ID debate.

419,"Greetings brother Arzick.   I have many acquaintances from St. Mark's Coptic church near Washington DC....

I used to be an evolutionist.  What was the most significant thing that changed my mind?  Life does not arise by itself from dead chemicals, therefore it took a miracle to make the first life.  If a miracle made the first life, then it became believable that a miracle could make all life fully formed without evolution at all.

&gt;So I just want to get an idea of what it took for some of you--who used to not be creationist--to go against the mainstream and proclaim creationism as true. Was there one particular thing that made you consciously switch sides?

I nearly left the Christian faith 17 years ago, but then began using my science background in engineering and physics to study the issue.  Over the course of 17 years and debating evolutionists I became more convinced of the case for creation.

Unfortunately, I saw a professor of biology at my university dismissed after she came to her senses and realized evolutionist have told her falsehoods all her life.  Since she was teaching evolution as a professor of biology, she had to learn evolutionary theory, and it didn't make sense.  She began to have doubts and eventually accepted Intelligent Design.  Her name was Caroline Crocker.

Miraculously several creationists got the PhD's in biology from the same school before Caroline Crocker was dismissed.

Gordon Wilson, PhD Biology
Timothy Standish, PhD biology
Timothy Brophy, PhD biology
Charles Jackson, PhD education, undergrad biology
and of course

So then we have 5 people associated with that school (George Mason) that have PhD's and 4 of them in Biology.  They all reject the mainstream.

I myself am a research assistant to a famous geneticist who used to be an evolutionist and an atheist, but now is a creationist, John Sanford, a retired research professor from Cornell University.

&gt;So I just want to get an idea of what it took for some of you--who used to not be creationist--to go against the mainstream and proclaim creationism as true. Was there one particular thing that made you consciously switch sides?

The matter takes a LOT of study to get an idea of which side has better arguments.   Let me suggest to you a 3-minute video that describes the process of DNA replication.  So many of the parts of the system have to be in place for it to work.   I've asked for years how this could evolve by itself naturally.  The more I've studied the system, the more ridiculous it seems it would emerge by itself without an Intelligent Designer making it possible.  


This 3-minute video is worth months of studying biology.  I've had the privilege of studying evolutionary theory from top evolutionary biologists.  The experience of this study only made me believe in creation more.


I recommend studying this 3-minute video over and over again.   You can spend as much time as you want studying it.  It's worth days of arguing with evolutionists if you can understand and describe the process depicted in this 3-minute video.  Even though the video is only 3-minutes, you can spend a lifetime trying to understand all the details, and the more that I studied it, the less I could believe it just evolved by itself, but rather it became easy to believe a miracle was the best explanation.

438,"Six Causes - The Vedic Theory of Creation by Ashish Dalela. I had previously read Vedic scriptures, but this book takes the subject and presents it in a Western-friendly, philosophic and scientific language. The last two chapters, about the nature of God's power and free will I found to be absolutely mind-bending.

From the book description:

*""In Vedic philosophy, creation is modeled as the creative activity of consciousness. Just as an artist creates a painting by first thinking about it and then embedding his ideas into matter, so the creator of the universe creates the world of objects by expressing meanings in His consciousness into undifferentiated matter.

Creation Has Six Causes

Creation in the Vedic view proceeds from the unconscious, to conscious experience, to material objects. Each of these three features has a subjective and objective aspect, thereby creating the six causes for which the author dedicates a chapter, as follows:

The Personal Cause of Creation explores the properties of consciousness, its quest for meaning and self-knowledge and how that quest forms the basis for the creation of the universe.

The Efficient Cause of Creation describes the mechanism by which the quest for meaning gradually becomes thoughts, desires, judgments, plans and actions, thereby creating various experiences.

The Instrumental Cause of Creation discusses the Vedic view on the senses, mind, intelligence and ego as the instruments that experience meanings, and embed meanings into matter.

The Formal Cause of Creation describes the nature of meanings and how these meanings are created as subtle information and then embedded into space-time to create differentiated objects.

The Systemic Cause of Creation explains how information in the mind is transformed into energy which is then represented into matter as sound vibrations denoting meanings.

The Material Cause of Creation describes how information is encoded as vibrations in space-time, and how modifications of these vibrations create other observable physical properties.

The six causes are prefaced by a chapter discussing basic difficulties in knowing the past, the problem of meaning, how this changes our outlook about space and time, and how the solution requires consciousness to create the fundamental distinctions in terms of which everything is known. In the process, the book touches upon issues of intelligent design, creationism, the creation vs evolution debate and the unique Vedic view on it. The last two chapters treat the nature of God and His power, the nature of free will and how it interacts with matter, which creates karma and leads to repeated births and deaths (also known as reincarnation).""*

Define information.  

&gt;we can't prove that the kind of information existing in living cells can be randomly generated.

Define random, because no process is truly random in the natural world.  The most random thing you may get is mutation, but even this is guided thanks to natural selection.  

&gt;Creationism seems to me like a default position

Agnosticism, or ""I don't know,"" on any issue is always the default position.  Creationism need to have evidence behind it for it to be concluded, which is why creationist models should include a phylogeny from every starting point to the current species of today, as well as evidence for any associated events if possible.  

&gt;According to my perception organised information (more advanced than any computer) already exists in living organisms. We only know of one thing that can do that type of organisation: minds.

This inference is not supported, because it has a fatal flaw in where the inference is made.  It assumes that, since information can only arise from minds, DNA must have arisen from a mind.  However, this ignores the fact that, of all the information systems we know of, DNA is the only one that is actually chemical, which means that it can arise naturally and correspond to proteins, functions, and of course, it can be ""read"" by other chemicals.  This means that mindless things can interact with other mindless things in fairly profound ways.  

&gt;Retrodictions like the theory of evolution, which is not a scientific theory but a historical science type of deal, is, in my opinion absolutely pathetic in solving this issue.

Justify that ""historical science"" should somehow be different than everything else in science.  Fossils, DNA, and research that examines populations is all observational.

&gt;One of them makes alpha amylase, an enzyme that breaks starch into the sugar maltose and shorter carbohydrate strands. Dogs carry many more copies of this gene than wolves, the scientists found — and the alpha amylase activity in their tissues is five times greater.

The further literature I've read (there are several articles on the subject, I haven't been exhaustive but still) states that every new copy leads to an increase of 5.4% in alpha amylase activity.

[This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5061917/) rules out 1 &amp; 2, I think:

&gt;Diploid copy numbers of two (2nAMY2B=2) in five golden jackals and a single coyote argue for an ancestral canid copy number of two. The initial duplication therefore likely represents a derived state in the lineage leading to dogs rather than being introgressed from any of these species. In contrast to a previous real-time quantitative PCR-based study that noted AMY2B duplications in 16 out of 40 wolves (Freedman et al., 2014), our observation of two AMY2B copies in 49 out of 51 wolves argues that the duplication was rare in wolves.

&gt;...

&gt;Similarly, whereas we observe clearly expanded AMY2B arrays in 44 out of 46 breeds, we find few copies in Greenland dog and Siberian husky. This pattern is compatible with several possible scenarios for how the diet change may have been associated with the domestication process. It fits a scenario whereby dogs were first domesticated and spread across the globe followed by a subsequent diet change and copy number expansion throughout most of the dog population.

I didn't mean to change the subject.  Haldane's calculations are about the time needed for beneficial mutations to arise and fix across an entire population.  This assumes that beneficial mutations are rare and occur only once in a population.  The YEC diversification model breaks both of those assumptions because:

1.  Beneficial but function degrading mutations are common, since there are many ways to break a gene.
1.  Most genetic variants were originally created within animal genomes and didn't have to arise by mutations.
2.  Because of #2, these variants already exist at high frequencies within populations, as opposed to reaching high frequency through a process of selection.  And thus they can become fixed much more easily, especially with bottleneck + founder effects.

3.  Dogs had mutations that broke the switches that shut off genes involved in carb metabolism, allowing for more of their gene products to be produced.

Good assumptions are those that help us solve a problem—i.e. find an answer that addresses the question. Bad assumptions are those that limit us in finding the answer to a problem.

Now our quest for truth is limited by our desires. If you choose a goal, you will naturally make assumptions that are fit for fulfilling that goal, and all claims will be certified either true or false relative to those assumptions.

Same here, but because I thought it was awful.  A little background on me.  Even though I argue a lot about biology, my training is in computer engineering and physics.  My graduate advisor, Bryan Jacobs was an expert in Quantum Computing.  I studied Quantum Mechanics specifically because of its relation to ID.

Tipler had a more succinct way of stating the issue:

&gt;As a physicist, I am aware that quantum mechanics, the central theory of modern physics, is even more deterministic that was the classical mechanics of which Darwin was aware. More than this, quantum mechanics is actually teleological, though physicists don’t use this loaded word (we call it “unitarity” instead of “teleology”). That is, quantum mechanics says that it is completely correct to say that the universe’s evolution is determined not by how it started in the Big Bang, but by the final state of the universe. Every stage of universal history, including every stage of biological and human history, is determined by the ultimate goal of the universe. And if I am correct that the universal final state is indeed God, then every stage of universal history, in particular every mutation that has ever occurred, or ever will occur in any living being, is determined by the action of God. 

Tipler is a respected physicst and student of John Wheeler who had at least one, maybe a few, Nobel Prize winning students or protege's under him.  Barrow is also respected and so is Richard Conn Henry.

3,"Okay, here we go. I'm just going to handle the AMS at the moment, because you seem to think this machine is more precise than it really is. I'm going to show why the limit is around 100K years, and why samples older than that -- and samples that are completely depleted -- will still show very, very small amounts of C-14 in the readouts.

&gt;You haven't proven they are lies. You want to make some credible claims, you'll have to explain in detail why an Acceletor Mass Spectrometry meter can't detect C-14 levels consistent with 100,000 year ages.

AMS is superior to traditional beta decay C-14 testing for two reasons:

1. It counts the number of atoms sorted by weight, so you can get the other carbon ratios as well.

2. It requires a substantially smaller sample, as you no longer need to deal with the statistical noise in beta decay.

However, that doesn't make AMS foolproof. [This is a very good entry level presentation on AMS dating](https://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys10262/art-chap3-5.pdf), I'll refer to it substantially as we go along -- I recommend looking it over.

Since AMS is far more precise, it's also very sensitive to contamination. The remains of a few bacteria would inevitably include modern C-14 and that would show up on your test. We work around that by increasing the sample size and using good technique.

However, AMS sorts by molecular weight and ionization, and uses ionization to sputter the sample. This produces ions that appear as C-14 [page 5]:

&gt; However, the molecular ions 12CH2- and 13CH- are produced, and are accelerated with the 14 C-. 

The amounts aren't too high, there are components to the machine designed to remove as many as possible, and you can work around it by taking a substantial sample size -- but a depleted sample is still going to produce these ions and if there's not enough true C14 in the sample, those few that get through matter. This is the biggest source of noise in the experiment -- we could purify C-12 and still the AMS would report some tiny measure of C-14.

So, why would these tiny amounts matter?

The halflife of C-14 is 5,730 years. At the 100,000 year mark, there is 131,000x less C-14 than there was to begin with. The natural rate of C-14 is approximately 1 in a trillion atoms, already pretty damn low, suggesting there would be 1 C-14 remaining for every 131 quadrillion carbon atoms. I did some back of the envelop math [carbon atoms / avogadro's = mols of Carbon containing 1 C-1; divide by 12 to get expected C14 per gram], I might have butchered the figures, but I'm getting a number close to 500 C-14 in a 20mg sample, which is fairly standard for AMS -- this would take approximately 3h for the machine to process.

Anyway, let's take a look at 

Page 3 suggests the count rate for AMS on a sample with 6*10^5 C-14 in it is 500 per minute. Our sample is significantly lower than that, such that we might expect to get 5 per minute.

Page 10 includes a chart of outputs from tests on 20,000 year old wood, showing (13CH)- and (12CH2)- in numbers already magnitudes more frequent than 14C. I believe these values need to be separated out experimentally -- how many ions your machine normally generates with a calibration sample -- but are still subject to a good bit of noise. So, when you're trying to find the 500 14C left, it's hard when you're getting a few hundred thousand of the ions.

On page 22 they go into the sample size requirements for statistical confidence for what I believe would be a ~50,000 year old object and it requires a sample size of 0.2mg -- we require approximately 256x this much to get an accurate read for 100K, which puts out side the standard sample range.

And page 11 goes over the background sources that need to be accounted for.

I mean, honestly, did you not expect a machine to suffer from noise?",1,1516750574,2018-01-23 18:36:14

26,"I figured since there's a little bit of confusion (not everybody magically knows about the Sahelantropus ""controversy""), here's some context:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus

&gt;Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have walked on two legs. However, because no postcranial remains (i.e., bones below the skull) have been discovered, it is not known definitively whether Sahelanthropus was indeed bipedal, although claims for an anteriorly placed foramen magnum suggests that this may have been the case. Upon examination of the foramen magnum in the primary study, the lead author speculated that a bipedal gait ""would not be unreasonable"" based on basicranial morphology similar to more recent hominins. Some palaeontologists have disputed this interpretation, stating that the basicranium, as well as dentition and facial features, do not represent adaptations unique to the hominin clade, nor indicative of bipedalism; and stating that canine wear is similar to other Miocene apes. **Further, according to recent information, what might be a femur of a hominid was also discovered near the cranium—but which has not been published nor accounted for.**

The highlighted part is what the author of OP's link is talking about.",1,1516727583,2018-01-23 12:13:03
27,"&gt; If these fossils are to be accepted, then this specimen cannot be a hominen fossil and thus, not a transitional specimen.

...not at all. If the femur is accepted as being part of Sahelantropus, Sahelantropus will go from possibly bipedal to not bipedal. That's literally it. Nothing else to it, the only controversial thing about Sahelantropus is its supposed bipedality. Nobody is saying anything about its classification of being a hominid fossil or about it being transitional.

Check the Wikipedia page right now, which is already up to date with the current controversy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus

&gt; **Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have walked on two legs.** However, because no postcranial remains (i.e., bones below the skull) have been discovered, **it is not known definitively whether Sahelanthropus was indeed bipedal**, although claims for an anteriorly placed foramen magnum suggests that this may have been the case. [...] **Further, according to recent information, what might be a femur of a hominid was also discovered near the cranium—but which has not been published nor accounted for.**

Now it looks like the femur could indeed point to Sahelantropus not being bipedal. So what? Who besides you is claiming this is going to make Sahelantropus not a honinin or transitional? The author in OP's article sure isn't.

&gt;haldanes dilemma 

Haldane's Dilemma is that you don't inherit one gene, you inherit half the genes. If you want a gene to spread, it takes a long time to spread naturally. But that doesn't mean it has to be perfectly natural.

Haldane's Dilemma is resolved through lots of death. A whole ton of death.

Near extinction events, permanent migrations and speciation events resolve Haldane's Dilemma, because Haldane's Dilemma is not a paradox. It's the kind of nightmare you have to worry about if you needed to repopulate the Earth and ensure we had a particular resistance gene in the genetic pool.

90,"&gt; I wanted a source about your claim about changing fitness landscapes.

That's the claim of some evolutionists in DebateEvolution, not me.  I think most beneficial mutations are always beneficial and that most deleterious mutations are always deleterious.  Counter-examples like sickle cell anemia are rare, and they act by breaking hemoglobin to the point that p. falciparum (parasite that causes malaria) doesn't even want it.  In an environment with malaria, this will be a beneficial mutation because you'll have more surviving offspring.  But it's still a net loss of function.  If we're trying to account for evolution creating the amount of function we see in human genomes, this is a worst case scenario.  Not only is the mutation destroying information, but selection makes it more likely to spread.

&gt; most deleterious mutations are not selected out due to their average low effect on fitness, right? 

Right.  See Sanford's simulations with Mendell, such as [here](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0010) he uses real world estimates of selection coefficients.

Biochemically, most deleterious mutations act by making protein folds and binding sites weaker, or disabling them entirely.  We can create an environment where that protein is not needed, or it's hazardous to even have that protein.  E.g. melanin in Nordic climates, since melanin decreases vitamin D production from sunlight.  Then all the deleterious mutations in that protein are now beneficial!  But ultimately we're losing information.  If the environment changes back to the original, it's much harder for evolution to undo those damaging mutations than it was to create them in the first place.  Since any random mutations will degrade a protein, but you need very specific mutations to undo that damage.

I learn mostly by reading journal articles directly.  I began not knowing much, but I would stop and look up terms I didn't understand as I read.  I would find interesting journal articles by seeing what was cited on the ID and evo blogs.  I also took a few biology classes on Coursera and read a few of the books from the discovery institute authors.

97,"&gt;And, as one of the articles I linked above points out, water contains information in the exact same way. 

Dude, the articles do not say that. Nothing even close to that. Both the Huff Post and Smilodon's Retreat articles are to persuade against oversimplifying genetic information. Basically, there are a lot more interactions going on so an analogy to digital information breaks down because it's too simple. 

You can use lots of information to represent water, sure, but water does not contain information that represents something else. Genetic information, encoded in DNA, contains representations of structures outside of the DNA itself. 

A simple example - a protein's make-up is stored in DNA. Nothing  about that information is ""just like water.""

Your Huff Post article refers to genetic information 5 times and they didn't go into some ""special"" definition. From there:

""DNA contains basic **information** that, when combined with the appropriate organic structures (in the egg) and context (the mother’s uterus), will facilitate the growth of a single cell (the combined sperm and egg) into a multibillion-cell person.""

---
I'm happy to walk away but I followed this ""all the way down"", so to speak, because I hear people denying that genomes are information fairly regularly. I still hold that there is ample evidence that genomes contain literal information, as instructions and many other things, and no ""special"" definition of information is needed to understand that this is information. 

And no, water does not contain information in the exact same water. ",1,1516622016,2018-01-22 06:53:36

99,"&gt;A source for the claim that those with beneficial mutations will have more surviving offspring? And that those with deleterious mutations will have fewer surviving offspring? That's the actual definitions of beneficial and deleterious. It's like asking for a source that a biped has two legs. If something has two legs then it's a biped.

No, I wanted a source about your claim about changing fitness landscapes. That selection would select out deleterious mutations that would've been beneficial and that it would promote beneficial mutations   that would later be harmful. I would just like an experiment confirming this.
&gt;On the second part, what do you want sourced? I assumed this was common sense

It may if you're debating someone who isn't too familiar with population genetics and who may not know this and wouldn't know that the average deleterious mutation is more impactful than the average beneficial one.

Also, I have come up with a critiscism of this.
&gt;However, if a beneficial mutation is sometimes deleterious and a deleterious mutation is sometimes beneficial, then selection is less efficient. Selection will remove deleterious mutations that will later turn out to be beneficial, and it will promote beneficial mutations that will later be deleterious.

If I remember right, most deleterious mutations are not selected out due to their average low effect on fitness, right?  Some DM's will be selected out for sure, but most will stay in the organism. So under a fluctuating fitness landscape, an organism has a ton of potential beneficial mutations that could increase it's fitness. So while selection would be promoting beneficial mutations that would later be DM's, most of the DM's being produced would not be selected out and serve as ammunition for later changes in fitness landscape that would render them beneficial. How would this be accounted for?

Calling DNA and genomes ""blueprints"" or comparing it to a computer isn't completely accurate in a lot of cases. However, even calling a genome a ""blueprint"" is not nearly as wrong as stating that genetic information is analogous to rocks rolling down hills.

If an organism has 10 harmful mutations with selection coefficients of -0.01, and one beneficial mutation with a coefficient of 0.001, then the deleterious mutations have a much larger effect than the beneficial mutation.  Selection will favor whichever organism has the least deleterious mutations and in most cases having such a beneficial mutation will be unlikely to affect the outcome of selection.

113,"One of my problems with the NT is this tendency to take things in snippets. Lots of snippets. Had a friend, her aunt used to print off Bible verses and stick them up all around her house with tape. Lots of memorizing little verses to remember when things get tough, when your faith gets tested.

Memetic priming is unusual. You can perform unusual changes to a person's psychology if you can prime them correctly -- bluntly the result is confusion, but by knowing the precise nature and timing of that confusion, you can inject your own 'facts' to solve the mystery you created. Giving you phrases or actions to perform in response to psychological pressures -- that's a very strong method of imprinting, but it's pretty obvious and requires willing participation.

The E-meter is an interesting tool: it's one piece of a standard lie detector, a skin galvanometer. It was originally designed for psychotherapy: the meters and gauges were designed so a trained psychologist could check for subconscious response. 

The Scientologists took it to a scientific level: they hook you the E-meter, and make you recite a list of words. Some are emotionally charged, some are not. They try to flatten you out. Who knows what else they inserted into their programming -- I got a hold of their documents and most is focused on wearing you out mentally with repetitive conjugation. Their method is aggressive, but they do have the tech to run it.

Often I wonder if religions got to this first. Mantras, chanting, memorization, singing, they are all a method of synchronizing and priming thought and behaviour -- the eastern philosophies are particularly upfront about this, their mantras are intended to get you into a headspace ready for the experiences they offer. The new world religions took a shortcut through mind-altering drugs, though there are allusions to those in the Bible.

133,"&gt;That's assuming the flood waters weren't flowing so fast they simply pulverized every rock standing in their way.

I was just going off of what you said, and anyways water wouldnt pulzerive every rock on the planet to sand or smaller, it is a greater assumption to assume this. The water would break off chunks of rock ranging from boulders to gravels (this is what we see in nature), but once the chunks are broken off they wouldnt be pulverized too much further. Also if the flood were to pulzerive all the rocks on the planet then there is a 0% chance noahs ark survives the flood.

&gt;We've witnessed smaller flood events produce similar results on a smaller scale. It really is the best explanation for the evidence.

Which flood would you like to discuss? I assume the Missoula glacial floods?

&gt;The biggest problem I have with the sediment layers being laid down over eons theory is that they're so darn uniform. How does one layer form so perfectly over another, not changing gradually, but within the breadth of a hair?

Soils are good at sorting themselves especially with intermitten rain fall. Have you ever dug soil profiles? If you have youll know what im talking about,  when i say soils are good at sorting themselves out via texture, and chemical composition to a degree. This is why when you dig a metre deep hole in a field you'll see 3-4 distinct layers (generally depending on the climate). Now this also applies to rock formations especially once a sediment has become lithified.

So just name one.  Would a miracle (like a God of the Gaps demonstration) do it for you?  

&gt;Christianity is absurd if viewed from the outside

So if the Christian God gave you that miracle that you say would persuade you He is real, would you then serve him or would you prefer to go to hell.  You just said Christianity is absurd.  Would you prefer to go to hell and hang out with people who share your views or would you serve the Christian God whom you say is absurd. Now, I'm not trying to be harsh, but several evolutionists have said explicitly they would rather go to hell than serve the Christian God even if they were provided the evidence.

136,"&gt; Why? What's your motivation for wanting to serve someone like that?

When I was able to accept by faith that we were as the Christian God said, children of darkness without Jesus, then I saw things differently.   A cockroach thinks it probably deserves life, but relative to the purposes of a human, say a human wife and mother wanting a good environment for her human kids, then the cockroach is an offense to her.  It would be easy for the cockroach to think the humans were immoral for putting their needs and wants first.  I could accept that relative to the ultimate good in the universe we are far more offensive to God than cockroaches are to us, just by nature.

If then I had found mercy in God's eyes and have been spared from eternal punishment, then in gratitude I could love him.

It's not uncommon to hear those who reject the Christian faith to say they are more righteous and moral than God because they would not, for example, allow childhood cancer to happen if they had the power to prevent it.

&gt;What's your motivation for wanting to serve someone like that?

At some level, why I love God, or for that matter why I love one thing over another, transcends explanation.  But it partly became possible when I decided we weren't as deserving of good anymore than a cockroach is in the scheme of things.  

From a cockroach's perspective, I suppose he feels a moral God would make all reality the focus of the cockroach's needs and wants.   Humans deciding that God isn't moral based on the fact that humans aren't the full focus of reality, is about as sensible as cockroaches deciding God isn't moral because they are killed by the millions by pesticides.  In the scheme of things, we are nothing before and infinite creator. But if God has mercy on us, then I could love him.

I use to be a believer, and the absolute silence on the other end of that prayer hotline was one of the biggest reasons I started doubting his existence in the first place. The doubt got me interested in studying the Bible more closely. What I discovered (combined with the continued silence) drove me to abandon my belief in a benevolent Christian god, and it progressed into me losing my belief in the existence of any type of god as I learned more.

The only reason I hesitate is because I currently don't think he's quite as benevolent as most Christians claim.

If he turns out he's exactly the character that I imagined him to be while reading the Bible, I wouldn't want to serve someone like that. If that newly opened line of communication was able to convince me of his benevolence, I would have no problem serving someone like that.

Selection will remove deleterious mutations that will later turn out to be beneficial, and it will promote beneficial mutations that will later be deleterious.

&gt;In respect to my argument with the microbe vs mammal evolution: The average deleterious mutation has a larger negative effect than the average beneficial mutation has a positive effect.

However, they get that number by assuming the evolutionary timeline of humans and also that synonymous mutations are neutral, so it's probably not very accurate.

Second, proteins are made of amino acids, and only 2-3% of the human genome codes for proteins.  So they are saying that within 2-3% of that part of the genome, 80% of mutations are deleterious.  The 97-98% of DNA that is not protein coding works in very different ways, so this 80% can't be extrapolated across the rest of the genome.

173,"1.  Suppose beneficial mutations are always beneficial, and  deleterious mutations are always deleterious, regardless of the environment.  This is a best case scenario for evolution, because then selection can act consistently upon these mutations to either spread or remove them.

2.  However, if a beneficial mutation is sometimes deleterious and a deleterious mutation is sometimes beneficial, then selection is less efficient.  Selection will remove deleterious mutations that will later turn out to be beneficial, and it will promote beneficial mutations that will later be deleterious.

I suspect most mutations fall in category #1 and not category #2.  How many disease causing mutations in humans can you think of that are beneficial in the right environment?  Not very many.  But if an evolutionist wants to argue that most mutations are category #2, that only makes their case more difficult.

eight people survived? *eight?* how would you have enough people to build the pyramids a couple of hundred years after the worldwide human population was reduced to eight? (or, from the biblical view, we can add the tower of babel even sooner afterwards.)

Furthermore, if this was all based on one historical event, we would expect to see roots in many of these myths that are fundamentally similar. A lot of Near Eastern, Malaysian, and Polynesian flood myths are their creation myth! That's a pretty far departure from the biblical flood to just be a morphed version...

Not that any of that really gets it for me, though. The main reasons I can't accept the biblical flood are:

1.) If you have a genetic population of less than a dozen people, that gene pool is absolutely doomed. That's pretty basic biology. Forget all of the other ""kinds"" (whatever that is) that would be reduced to populations of 2 or 7. No more animal life on earth after that man. Game over.

Genes, encoded in DNA, are literally instructions. It's a textbook definition, not an analogy.

&gt; it just happens naturally based on the laws that govern chemistry interacts. 

No, that's not how it works. Embryos and the cells of most mammals need chromosomes, containing genomic instructions to develop. Sections of the genome contain specific instructions on how to develop the organism. It's not just chemical reactions ""doing their thing"" - specific proteins, enzymes, and a thousand other things are produced with in cells where and when they are needed based on genomic instructions. 

This isn't controversial, no obfuscation, that's really how genes work. 'Instructions' is the term I see used most commonly and some biologists will object to calling those instructions information. If anything is obfuscating, in my opinion, it's biologists teaching that genomic instructions shouldn't be considered information.

Also, a claim is not ""are there scientific answers to the following questions?"" Its ""carbon falsified old earth"" ""evolution is impossible because encode"""" Abiogenesis is improbable""""evolution uses circular reasoning"" followed by a list of arguments supporting it. At no point should a claim be in the form of a question at all.

&gt;The main way was through climate elevation. Ecosystems at lower altitudes would be buried lower, but one with higher altitudes would be buried higher.



Yes, but rock strata exists in a range of elevations.



&gt;It explains why we see simple marine life located near the bottom of the ocean build up to more complex land life at higher altitudes. 



But there is complex deep sea marine life. Also what do you mean by ""primitive""?

But as for your other question, there's significant debate over were the flood post flood boundary. The k/t boundary makes sense due to the fossil difference which makes uniformitarian paleontologist think that there was a mass extinction event at around that time period. However, another boundary is at the late cenozoic right at the quarternary boundary. This makes the most sense as this is were the ice age happened, which would've been immediately post flood.

**Since a remote time, people had abandoned it, without order expressing their words.** Since that time the earthquake and the thunder had dispersed the sun-dried clay.

I think the creationist stereotype plays a major role in convincing ordinary people. On the one hand we have the 'scientists' and those who support them, who are unbiased and base their beliefs on evidence. On the other hand we have religious believers who are trapped in their thinking due to fear of death. So that if you are in one of these groups, depending on what you believe, your self image will be affected. Rational thinker trumps religious ignorance. The benefits of the stereotype are all in favour of being a naturalist, you can instantly gain credibility by believing in evolution, and you can instantly become ignorant and religiously motivated if you don't. Image is on the line, and pressure to conform. Interestingly, Cults often use these kind of stereotypes to discredit ex members and to reinforce current members that they are correct. If everybody believed evolution, If there was no creationism or Christianity or Islam or anything of the sort, evo would be much more criticised, because there would be no enemy to protect it against. If Somebody then brought up an apparently unevolvable system, chances are they would say ""Yeah, how did that evolve?"" Instead of answering in the negative like is currently done, ""Personal incredulity"" ""ignorance doesn't prove it's false"" and answers such as those designed to shut down discussion, enforce the stereotype and dismiss the challenge.

[Here's the full text of ""Pushing Back Amber Production"".](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26864018_Pushing_Back_Amber_Production)

I'm going to pull a few lines about the science in here:

&gt;Resins are so diverse that 
those from each plant species have a distinc-
tive Py-GC-MS ﬁ ngerprint that can be used 
to identify the plants that produced various 
ambers around the world. 

Plant resins are chemically distinctive, enough that resin and amber can be sourced to the types of plants that made them.

&gt;This ﬁ ngerprint analysis allows the sam-
ples of Bray and Anderson, which were 
found in Illinois, to be distinguished from 
other plant-derived resins from the same 
period and to narrow down their plant ori-
gins. 

This analysis allows the resin in this amber to be characterized, then compared to other plant resins that would have been around in this period. Because contrary to the OP, flowering plants aren't required -- I guess Wikipedia isn't perfect.

&gt;because the 
few analyses of resin rodlets reveal that they 
are a distinctive blend of phenols and naph-
thalenes unlike any other resin, whether fos-
sil or gathered from extant plants 

So, this amber is very distinctive -- it isn't from a flowering plant at all, and Wikipedia actually does need an update to that uncited line.

&gt;Other 
Carboniferous candidates for the Illinois 
amber are lycopsid tree ferns (whose remains 
make up much of Carboniferous coals) and 
the extinct progymnosperms 

So, there's actually no problem here. There are a few species expected to be around that would have this chemical signature.

&gt;In any case, this 
320-million-year-old amber is certainly not 
from angiosperms, which arose almost 200 
million years later. Thus, this amber casts per-
plexing new insight into the molecular char-
acterization of amber. 

Now be careful parsing this sentence, it's a tricky one: in any case, this amber is not from an angiosperm -- that is known from the chemical analysis. However, this amber is also very interesting because it is and isn't like most amber, so maybe we should be looking for this more often and look for what plants were producing this unusual resin.",1,1516408220,2018-01-19 19:30:20

&gt; It was a mammal that would only go near the water to grab fish. Paleontologists know this because its ears were only adapted for the land and not for the water. In 2001, scientists found fossils which confirmed the fact that this mammal lived entirely on the land and never went into the water.

&gt;The Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana has yielded many T. rex specimens, including well-documented dinosaur soft-tissue fossils. Surprisingly, in two volumes of papers published specifically on the Hell Creek discoveries, little is mentioned of the five species of shark and 14 species of fish fossils that are indicative of marine influence.1,2 Secular scientists either ignore these findings or dismiss them as all freshwater sharks and freshwater fish, in spite of the more likely conclusion that they represent marine organisms.

&gt;Other authors have studied the fauna of the Hell Creek Formation since the 1950s and found ample evidence of a mixture of marine and non-marine fossils.3,4 As Joseph Hartman and James Kirkland stated, “Although previously reported, knowledge of the continuation of marine conditions above the Fox Hills Formation [in the Hell Creek Formation] is not well or widely known.”1

&gt;It is now becoming obvious that the mixing of terrestrial and marine environments is not a rare occurrence in the rock record. Recent discoveries in Morocco and Europe have shown that most dinosaurs are found with marine fossils or buried in marine sediments.

not really, selection and variation post flood would've produced highly different animals  then the ones we would've saw post flood. Your right that there would be some similarity, which there is, to modern animals but the post flood ancestors to all tetrapods would've diversified to the point that we wouldn't expect them to look to much like the tetrapods we see today.

323,"&gt;Well, if we used C14 or racemization dating, we would get young dates. So well, that's disregarded. 

Yes, because neither is suitable for long term dating. C14 is completely depleted by 100,000 years, and depleted relative to the signal-noise ratio for standard testing procedure by 50,000 years.

Racemization is sensitive to local conditions in a way that nuclear isotopes aren't, which is why it has never been the preferred method of dating.

Let's not pretend they are 'disregarded' for issuing 'young' dates: they are disregarded because *by pure mathematics* they won't produce useful values beyond these intended windows; a 200,000 year old sample shows up as 50,000 years old during C14 testing because the C14 in the sample is depleted, but the small amounts in our atmosphere are not. You'll get the same results for a 100,000 year old sample or a 500,000 year old sample, which is why numbers around 40,000 - 50,000 years are treated with a great deal of skepticism.

343,"&gt; “we want to explain our Moon and earth as the outcome of a common and reasonable process”

That quote is taken a bit out of context. [Here is the source.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2026)


&gt; The giant impact hypothesis is compelling because it can explain the angular momentum constraints of the Earth–Moon system, and also because we know that terrestrial planets each experienced several (or even many) giant impacts as they grew. Competing hypotheses, such as fission of the Moon from a de-spinning Earth or capture of an unrelated Moon into orbit around Earth, do not fit as many of the required constraints, and require special pleading on several fronts.

&gt; And that is the heart of the issues discussed at the Royal Society meeting: **we want to explain our Moon and Earth as the outcome of a common and reasonable process.** The Earth and Moon should not be the special exception or a statistical improbability. Impacts are common and, in fact, required for accretion of all Solar System bodies. Occam's Razor — if one accepts that the simplest, most parsimonious explanation might also be the most common process — favours the hypothesis that giant impacts can often produce moons, and that those moons are often isotopically identical to their planets.

The highlighted quote (spoken by Elkins-Tanton) means that she thinks that hypothesis such as *""fission of the Moon from a de-spinning Earth or capture of an unrelated Moon into orbit around Earth""* require too much special pleading compared to a *""giant impact hypothesis""*. She therefore favors explanations that are more common, just like Occam's Razor states. Which is also the title of that article. A quite reasonable article at that.",1,1516385315,2018-01-19 13:08:35

&gt;The two scientists who found the lion’s share of walking whale fossils essentially created the best fossil proof of evolution using plaster models and drawings and supplied these to museums and science magazines. **In each case, they started with incomplete fossils of a land mammal. Whenever a fossil part was missing, they substituted a whale body part (blowholes, fins and flukes) on the skeletal model or skull that they distributed to museums. **When these same scientists later found fossils negating their original interpretations, they did not recall the plaster models or drawings. Now museums are full of skulls and skeletons of ‘walking whales’ that are simply false.” Dr. Werner went on to say, “I suspect some curators are not aware of the significance of these substitutions nor are they aware of the updated fossils. Museums should now remove all of the altered skeletons, skulls and drawings since the most important parts of these ‘walking whales’ are admittedly made up. Museums will also have to delete these images from their websites as they are misleading the public.”

&gt;&gt; The uniformitarianism that geologists embrace because it's required by evolution,

&gt; How so? As I recall, geologists use radiometric dating to date the age of the planet and solar system.

Well, they certainly can't date any solar system bodies besides the earth and moon with radiometric dating since we don't have rocks from them and we samples of the sun cannot be dated radiometrically. So you mean the earth and the couple of rocks that we have from the moon. 



""In early nineteenth-century Britain, catastrophism was adapted with the aim of reconciling geological science with religious traditions of the biblical Great Flood. In the early 1820s English geologists including William Buckland and Adam Sedgwick interpreted ""diluvial"" deposits as the outcome of Noah's flood, but by the end of the decade they revised their opinions in favour of local inundations.[25] **Charles Lyell challenged catastrophism""**  - from wikipedia

""Lyell, following deistic traditions, favoured an indefinitely long age for the earth, despite geological evidence suggesting an old but finite age.[2] **He was a close friend of Charles Darwin, and contributed significantly to Darwin's thinking on the processes involved in evolution.""** -- from wikipedia

So the original motivation for finding a long age for the earth (by Lyell) was connected to Darwin and evolution.

AIG points out that in many areas, long ages are NOT required: https://answersingenesis.org/geology/arent-millions-of-years-required-for-geological-processes/

As you point out, even the crystalline structures of rocks can be very 'complex'.

Humans are literally constructed of self-replicating nano machines that multiply, from one embryo to trillions of cells, based on the contents of our 23 pairs of chromosomes. With all of our medicine and study of our own bodies we are still learning how it all works through reverse engineering.

I actually think there's a sort of cognitive dissonance that smothers how incredible it all is. I think because life has effectively always been there these facts are normalized so it doesn't seem incredible. Nanotubes are the wave of the future but the nano machines we're made of are no big deal.

You can't use science to confirm or the deny the existence of the supernatural, because science is limited to studying natural phenomenon. ""Non-overlapping magisteria"" is the buzz word I see thrown around a lot in religious circles to explain this.

You can use scientific study to *infer* the existence of the supernatural, but you can't directly study the supernatural with science.

&gt; Fine, that's your definition for science.

So ... is there a problem with it? Do you have a better one?

&gt; Now prove no one was doing that ever before Christianity arose, and show how Christianity is explicitly required to do so.

_Weird._ What happened, a long time ago, was that one day I wondered why did science only arise in Western Europe and at that particular time so I decided to investigate it. I found a lot of contributing reasons, the Renaissance, a number of other things. But one of the things that I found was that Christianity was a key ingredient. Now, I didn't actually go looking for the origins of science with this in mind, but that's what I found. There is corroboration too. You can just as easily do the research as I did. Go talk to some history professors at your local university.

&gt; The Greeks had a system of four elements, which they used as a model for their material science. It was wrong, but they tried.
The alchemists had figured out a handful of elements and how they operated, long before your examples were around.

_I detect some undercurrents of belligerence._ Yes they had models, so did the idea of the four fluids in the body that determine personality. These models are basically based on magic, superstition. Just because someone can predict eclipses, doesn't mean that they understand why they happen. The ancient priestly caste would figure this out and then keep the times a secret so that they could appear powerful and command respect. That's still not science.  They are not doing experiments to confirm or disprove their models. The Greeks had lots of awesome ideas, but they didn't experiment. _Are you up in arms because you think I'm denigrating other cultures?_ The alchemists did invaluable work experimenting and documenting things and yes, they did indeed lay the groundwork for chemistry. 

_I don't really have anything else to say._",1,1511147655,2017-11-19 22:14:15
44,"Choice quotes from the article:

""Key naturalist doctrines such as the multiverse cannot be established on the basis of evidence. As we have seen, however, naturalists (nature is all there is) are gradually becoming comfortable with setting aside the decision-making tools of science, such as testability, falsifiability, and Occam’s razor, in favor of acceptance of consensus. And they are happy to dismiss reason.""
...
""We commonly hear, for example, that 'science is self-correcting!' A  more honest appraisal shows that there is no 'uniform self-correcting mechanism.'"" This quote stands out to me because modern science only allows naturalistic explanations. If the truth, however, lies at least partly in non-naturalistic explanations, then modern science will not ""self-correct"" unless there is some relaxing of the rule that only naturalistic explanations can be entertained.
...
""Meanwhile, alongside growing intolerance of findings not approved by the state cult, there is limitless tolerance for bizarre ideas that do fit.""

46,"You're right. I need to start by distinguishing between science, engineering and technology. If one can't distinguish between these things, then their definitions are so broad as to be useless and there is indeed no way to know anything about the origin of science, engineering, or technology, because they have always been with us.

Science is special and is a completely new way of looking at nature and allows us to make progress in ways that engineering and technology don't. Engineering is more how to do something. How to make good concrete. How to build roads that last for 1000 years. How to make flat screen TVs. Technology is the type of tools that we use: the wheel is technology, the forge, the printing press, the ballpoint pen, glassblowing. How are these different from science? Science requires an understanding of the principles behind technology and engineering. With concrete, we don't have an abstract equation derived from first principles. What we do is trial and error, sometimes with intuition and insight, and then we get better concrete. This is then codified in engineering handbooks: to make concrete bridges strong enough for a truck, this is what you have to do. Even though there is chemistry and physics involved, and we can calculate the forces, and know something about the chemical reactions in concrete, when it comes down to it, making concrete is an empirical endeavor, not a scientific one based on fundamental principles and equations. Technology is often discovered by accident or ingenuity. We don't have to understand the colloidal properties of ink and how light is absorbed by the double bonds in order to make ink and put it into a pen.

So what exactly is science? Science is looking at the world, at nature, and trying to understand the principles behind it. We come up with a theory and then test it. (Engineering can also come up with theories and test them: e.g. [adding some tiny plastic particles can strengthen concrete](http://news.mit.edu/2017/fortify-concrete-adding-recycled-plastic-1025) ). Science then looks at the results and modified the original theory and then looks for other predictions that can confirm or contradict the theory. This is a completely and radically new way of thinking that had its rudimentary beginnings with Sir Francis Bacon, and was then developed by a whole succession of natural philosophers and scientists in western Europe. [Yes, just because something happened in Europe doesn't make it a Eurocentric embarrassment. Maybe we should pretend that the printing press was invented in Irian Jaya so as not to be ""eurocentric""!] Science is not looking for practical applications, and it does not normally look at solving a practical problem. When it is concerned with the latter, it is looking at first principles, at having a deep and fundamental understanding of what the cause of something is.  For example: what makes copper the colour it is? The answer to that is science. It is impossible to answer it correctly without science, without the model of electrons and atoms. It also has no practical purpose - it does not affect how we use copper. However, as you are well aware (and sorry if I'm being condescending, but you're saying that you don't know the difference between science and engineering), science has many many applications that come out of it that we can't always predict. Knowing why copper and gold are coloured could logically let us make other coloured metals. Knowing why uranium ore fogs up photographic paper does not logically lead to nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs. Bequerel and Curie investigated this nonetheless, simply because of the passionate desire to understand how things work and why.

This incessant seeking for WHY things happen, for models that explain everything, is why the ancient civilizations cannot be said to have science even though they might have had fantastic engineering and technology.",1,1511140380,2017-11-19 20:13:00

52,"&gt;Or is it one of those things we just can't get a solid answer to?

Definitely this, but we can always speculate. I am favorable to the opinion that the ""light"" of Day 1 was essentially the Big Bang event, or something like it. Unfortunately I know very little about Big Bang cosmology, so there are probably a zillion reasons why the Big Bang theory is incompatible with young earth creationism. It would sure help to explain how well the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation matches up with the Big Bang-based model that predicted it so perfectly.

But supposing that Day 1 is the Big Bang event, it would definitely include the creation of light. In fact, with light being the (for lack of a better word) ""purest"" form of energy, I can see a lot of room to believe that God created all of the energy in the universe on Day 1, then condensed/compressed that energy into solid objects in the remaining days (especially days 2, 3, and 4).

Regarding the terms ""day"" and ""night,"" (or the repeated use of pre-sun ""morning"" and ""evening,"" for that matter), I've always just assumed that those terms were used to describe general light/dark conditions or 24-hour time frames in the absence of the sun.",1,1511070480,2017-11-19 00:48:00

The authors of this paper expand on what that means:

103,"Creationists have claimed from the beginning that created plant and animal ""kinds"" were created to be pretty static and unchanging, but with variability built-in to allow them to adapt to various environments. Thus, all the different types of humans have ""evolved"" from an ancestral human, but this ""evolution"" stops at the outer edges of ""human-ness"", and can not cross over from or to something non-human.

The fossil record supports this view - lots of variation on a theme, but a pretty static theme over all. Sharks show up in the record fully-formed, and then remain sharks until the present day. Dinosaurs show up in the record fully-formed, and then remain dinosaurs until they disappear from the record. Trilobites show up in the record fully-formed, and then remain trilobites until they disappear from the record. Beetles show up in the fossilized amber fully-formed, and then remain beetles until the present day.

Everyday life supports this view.

Thousands of years of animal husbandry supports this view.

Decades of intense research/experiments in the lab supports this view. You can breed a fruit-fly with four wings instead of two, or two heads, or twelve legs. But you get too far from the norm, and the reproduction process stops, along with any further evolution. The fruit-flies remain fruit-flies, no matter how hard the researchers try to push them beyond the outer limits of fruti-fly-ness.

In the 1940s, biologist Robert Godschmidt tried to explain this stasis in the rock record and in life and in experiments by presenting the ""Hopeful Monster Theory"", which in essence says that species remain static for long periods of time, then over a relatively short period, they evolve in a rapid burst to form a new species, which evolution is ""too fast"" to get captured by the fossil record. (Convenient.)

His theory never really caught on, because the biology just doesn't support it. Nevertheless, it was resurrected in the 1990s by Stephen J. Gould and Niles Eldridge as the Punctuated Equilibrium (""punk eek"") model. Although they well-demonstrated the weakness of the traditional Darwinian slow-change theory, their idea never really took either, because, again, the biology just doesn't support it.

Now, in 2017, the idea rears its head again. It has a new name - Punctuated Anagenesis - but it's the same old theory:

&gt; We propose a set of models, called Lévy processes, to attempt to reconcile apid evolution between species with the relatively stable distributions of phenotypes seen within species.

Wouldn't it be more scientific to just admit that the actual evidence is stasis of species, as predicted by creationists, not evolution from one species to some other, as shown in artists' renderings?",2,1510860639,2017-11-16 14:30:39

Not really it is a complex science.

More like what it needs to survive and thrive in the enviroment is stable. Living fossils are also quite rare.



&gt;Something is difficult to evolve but is found in completely separate branches of the evolutionary tree? That's just parallel or convergent evolution.


Convergent evolution is when 2 or more species evolve common traits that were not found in the last common ancestor, generally occuring as a result of similar enviroments and enviromental niches. Drastic examples while numerous are not the norm.



&gt;Genetic material that doesn't improve fitness but hangs around waiting conveniently until it's needed? Neutral evolution.


I would think this is the least controversial. An organism has a trait thats not good or bad in any significant way, but it does have positive traits that makes it a good mate. The neutral traits get passed on, along for the ride.

He was wrong about blended inheritance, but he was not terrible sure about it in the first place. He was right about common descent and didn't know about abiogenesis and so didn't say much about it.

188,"&gt;You can't both think that the mutation rates that determine an age for eve are valid but the very same approach to dating humans and our relatives is invalid.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding you.  By relatives, do you mean chimps?  If so, I don't see the contradiction.  I can accept the possibility that mutation rates might demonstrate the age of Mitochondrial Eve without accepting the completely independent idea that we are related to chimps.

&gt;One common misconception surrounding mitochondrial Eve is that since all women alive today descended in a direct unbroken female line from her, she must have been the only woman alive at the time.

You have misunderstood me, but it is my fault.  There are two things to distinguish.  

1) Is Mitochondrial Eve one woman?  The answer is yes, ""the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.""


2) Was she the first (or only) woman, or was she one in a population of thousands?  The concept of Mitochondrial Eve, in itself, does not favor one or the other possibility and remains intact in either scenario.  [Here is a good explanation of the point using the analogy of inherited surnames.](https://creation.com/a-shrinking-date-for-eve)  However, if we can explain the observed genetic diversity of living humans by positing that she was the first or only woman, then Ockham's razor should lead us to accept that explanation over the far less parsimonious extravagance of thinking that she was one of thousands.  Since there *are* justifiable reasons for believing that the observed genetic diversity of living humans can be explained by a single initial pair of humans, we should think of her as the first or only woman.  And this conclusion stands on its own, quite independent of the Genesis account.  [Here is one defense of the idea that the observed genetic diversity of living humans can be explained by a single initial pair of humans.](http://www.richardbuggs.com/email-to-dennis-venema-adam-eve-genomics.html)  And [here is another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEV5LB0ww3s&amp;t=1520s) (start around 20:00).    

&gt;All phylogenetic studies require common descent, you can't just pick and choose when you want to apply evolutionary principles.

You have misunderstood me again, but I'm not sure it is my fault this time.  You should have understood that when I said, ""inferences assuming common descent"" in reference to the study, I meant descent from an ancestor common to chimps and humans.  It should be self-evident that all creationists believe in common descent with reference to Adam and Eve.

&gt;It's purely your interpretation and projection that derives something sinister from this. 

I have not accused them of anything overtly dishonest or sinister.  I only said I was disturbed by their a priori rejection of the possibility that their own work could reflect an accurate age for Mitochondrial Eve.

&gt; When do mutations stop?

When do they stop? That's a great question. At what point, if ever, do species cease to evolve, and would a single species not evolving overturn Darwin's theory of evolution, or would it just be cited as more proof? (Do we need to rename it ""Darwin's theory of evolution and non-evolution"" to be more complete?) This is important because it gets to whether the theory is even falsifiable.

Regarding ""characteristics"", it is not enough to say that children will have the same color of hair as their parents. That won't necessarily lead to speciation. Thus, you need some broader definition of characteristics, something that *doesn't* come from their parents at all, IE, lungs instead of gills, vertebrae where none existed before, that sort of thing. Thus, I see a need to distinguish between characteristics that have already existed and new characteristics. Surely you see the entire theory of evolution rests on this!

&gt; You seem to want theory laden definitions without grasping why that is a bad idea.

I'm genuinely confused. We want to discuss Darwin's theories, so we need definitions before we can talk about his theories. Of course these definitions themselves are going to lend to one theory being right or wrong. That's why we have to be precise --- so we can see what is right and what is wrong using logic alone.

By insisting on definitions, you feel weak, and that is right, because evolutionists have always hidden behind weak terms, imprecise terms, words that can mean nothing and everything at the same time. This is the very heart of the beast, and I am striking at it.

&gt; You refuse to understand and then think the problem is other people.

Have you heard of Socrates?

&gt; I don't recommend biology for you, you will be too blind to understand.

""Blindness"" you say. Objective I say. I refuse to see subjective ""facts"", I refuse to argue with imprecise logic. I know, terrible, right?

&gt; Now does physics deal with proof? Give me some examples of proof in science.

HAHAHAHAHA! You have awoken a beast. Let me begin.

Oh gosh, where to begin...

Let's prove QM, shall we? Have you heard of the ""photoelectric effect""? It's what makes solar panels possible. Why is it that a weak light can excite an electrical potential? The light doesn't have to be bright. It turns out, it is the frequency of the light that is important, as experiment has shown. If the frequency is too low, no potential is created, but if the frequency is high enough, the potential is created, and it is proportional to the intensity of light. Physicists puzzled over this, because according to basic thermodynamics energy is conserved. The piece of metal should be heated by the incident light, and those particles that are traveling fast enough would be ejected, thus creating the potential, probably because the electrically negative particles are much less massive than the positive ones. (Remind me to lecture on Rutherford and why he should be considered the greatest physicist ever.)

The key here is that thermodynamics made a prediction of how the electric potential should be generated by the incident light, and it wasn't only wrong, it was completely wrong. So Einstein proposed packets of energy called ""photons"" and now we know that while light behaves like a wave, it *also* behaves like a particle.

The great thing about this experiment is you can do it yourself. You can work out the math for thermodynamics, see how the electric potential should be generated according to temperature, and you can shine different frequencies of light with different intensities and see for yourself how the potential behaves. You can prove for yourself that the thermodynamic explanation of the photoelectric effect is wrong, and how we needed a new theory to explain why it did what it did.

I won't write the entire first section of modern quantum physics textbooks for you, but this should give you a taste of how we prove things in physics. We have our math, we try it out in nature, and we defer to what nature said, even if it means our math is all wrong.

The same goes for electrodynamics. Start with amber and glass rods, move into currents and then magnetism. Discover the force due to currents interacting with magnetic fields, work out Maxwell's equations for yourself (and see how tempting Ether Theory is), then apply them to numerous situations, discover that momentum and energy can be contained by the fields themselves, making them as physical, if not more so, than charged particles, and finally see how relativity perfectly lines up with all of the theories, unifying magnetism and electricity into a single force. Of course, physics students spend an entire year studying this vigorously, so don't beat yourself up if you take a lot longer to understand all of it.

Do I need to go on?

&gt; You have posted pages of denial

&gt; First, how was Darwin wrong

&gt; Second, why does it matter if his work has been expanded upon or replaced by better science?

See, in another post you say you want to argue in good faith. Here you show you have absolutely no interest in good faith discussion. If you don't understand those terms then you need far more help in getting started here than I am willing to offer. 

&gt;Change: Except when things DON'T change because they have somehow hit a peak or something. (So evolution is the theory that things change until they don't anymore.)

When do mutations stop?

&gt;Inherited: Unless you're bacteria which cross-populates genetic code. Or there are viruses that do the same.

Which still is a change in what is inherited by the next generation. There is not the slightest good faith in your work.

&gt;There's two sorts of characteristics I'd be interested in, ones that don't lead to speciation (whatever that is) and ones that do. 

Now that is a perfect example of your intellectual dishonesty. You wanted to get some atomic level *definition* of terms. Then you suddenly jump to an entirely different discussion. You seem to want theory laden definitions without grasping why that is a bad idea.

202,"Define ""Exist"". Because there are some whackadoodle theories out there that says gravity *doesn't exist* and it's all due to random motion and entropy.

And GR says that gravity isn't a force, it's a distortion of spacetime itself.

If we were to shove gravitons into QFT, it would make it no longer a force but a field, just like all the other fields that used to be forces.

But when we put those two together, we get wildly different results. Don't imagine that the best minds in physics haven't tried everything.

Your primitive understanding of gravity is not at all correct, and to compare evolution to it shows your lack of understanding for either or both.

If you jump off a cliff, will you fall? Depends on where you are, which orientation the cliff has, how big everything is, and how high you jump.

Is that the theory of evolution -- only applicable to a tiny set of circumstances that are meaningless in the cosmic and microscopic scale?",1,1510244274,2017-11-09 11:17:54
203,"&gt; I'd prefer you argue in good faith

It is not a standard meet though. 

&gt;Except for where it was wrong, am I right?

Apparently you don't know what it means for a theory to be either successful or productive.

&gt;Which was pretty much in every prediction he made. 

Physics said the Earth was about 100M years old, Darwin said it was billions of years old. Darwin was right, physicists wrong.

&gt;Because Darwin was wrong. And we need to be honest with ourselves about what he got right and what he got wrong.

Honest? I'm waiting.

",1,1510244088,2017-11-09 11:14:48
204,"&gt; So do we reject physics because Newton was wrong?

Yes.

And then we invent new physics.

&gt; Do we reject evolution because (in some way you refuse to discuss) Darwin was wrong?

No, you (and evolutionists in general) do not. They hang on to Darwin even though they know he was wrong.

(We have discussed how Darwin was wrong in a separate thread. You already admitted he was wrong, so I hope that matter is settled now.)

&gt; You keep attacking Darwin and I keep saying lets discuss the modern synthesis. 

I was under the notion that this entire thread was devoted to whether Darwin was right or wrong.

Would you like to engage in a separate debate? That's usually the sign that you lost the debate and conceded the point.",1,1510244017,2017-11-09 11:13:37

206,"&gt; So to be clear is the orbit a fact or a theory?

It was a theory, an extraordinarily accurate theory, but it was wrong. The orbits are not perfect ellipses.

&gt; You brought up ellipses and announced I was wrong about something I never said.

You alluded to earlier theories about stellar motion, calling them ""orbits"". So I assumed you were referring to them. Again, the onus is on you to use precise language.

Something else: You never stated which frame of reference you were observing the moon orbit the earth. Because in one non-inertial frame of reference, it is the earth that orbits the moon.

The Catholic Church said the sun goes around the earth. Galileo said the earth goes around the sun. Einstein said they were both right.

&gt; word cloud

I try to be parsimonious with my language. I also try to use the correct terms for things. You calling that a ""word cloud"" really says something about the level of pedanticism and rigor you are willing to engage in.

I am inviting you to engage me in logical debate, to join me with precise language. You seem to be refusing the offer.",1,1510243902,2017-11-09 11:11:42
207,"&gt; Are you confused by the term? Is it new to you?

Yes.

&gt; Did Jesus tell you Darwin was wrong? Did he show you?

I know that God created the heavens and the earth, and I know that we were placed here for a purpose. I know that the universe couldn't exist without his divine power. I've known for a long time that the laws we have discovered through science have shown the universe to be an impossibility, if it wasn't for some supernatural power that can keep it running.

&gt; Please quote me saying that [science and religion are the same thing].

You said, ""I believe in evolution.""

Done.

&gt; Now are you ever going to explain how Darwin was wrong or why it matters?

You already admitted to it, in a different thread.",1,1510243613,2017-11-09 11:06:53
208,"&gt; You should put that on your business cards. 

We use resumes to tell people are experience. And while I don't say ""I am an expert in science"", I do say, ""My training in physics helps me solve problems faster using scientific principles."" Well, not in those words. Science, the art of it, not the modern-day false science of memorizing a bunch of facts handed down from on high, is something I drive my team to embrace. When we see a bug, I say, ""Ok, let's document. What do you think went wrong? How can we test it?"" I have a rule that no one can change code, especially in the bits that we don't understand well, until they have performed experiments with it and shown that they have an understanding of the problem.

&gt; Is any of the steps to recognize your limitations and recognize that you don't have expertise outside your field of study?

That would be ""Step one: question everything you were told, no matter the source.""

If I want to approach an area scientifically, I have to ""forget"" what I know. For instance, if you ""know"" that the computer is plugged in, you have to forget that, and ask, ""Did I plug in the computer?"" Even though 99% of the time you did, that 1% of the time will get you every time.

So to claim expertise in a particular subject is to admit to my ignorance of it.

I know far less about physics that you probably think you know (given the fact you aren't a BS.) If I had gone on to earn my MS or PhD, I would know even less about it. Have you ever talked with a professor of physics who says, ""How do we *know* the speed of light is constant everywhere? Why must it be so?"" That's the sort of ignorance you need to be a good scientist.",1,1510243444,2017-11-09 11:04:04
209,"&gt; You really don't seem to understand how this works.

I'd prefer you argue in good faith and pretend I can actually understand whatever you write. I won't suppose to know the extent of your understanding or competence. I'll assume you're just as good as the next man at logic and reason, and we'll keep ourselves out of this argument.

&gt; Newton got F=MA right

Newton did NOT get F=ma right. Have you heard of Quantum Physics, or of electrodynamics, or relativity? The ""F"" ""m"" and ""a"" in that equation all mean things different than what Newton meant.

&gt; (for sufficiently low speeds and masses)

Ah yes, it was Newton who said, ""My theory only applies as an approximation that is valid at speeds much smaller than the speed of light, and regions much larger than the Planck length, even though those two numbers have yet to be discovered.""

You're saying ""Newton was right, except for the parts he was wrong about!""

You can say that about anyone and anything.

So physicists just say, ""Newton was wrong.""

&gt; You confuse ""got wrong"" with ""didn't know"". 

Those are the same things. Well, not quite, since if you don't know and guess right, you're not wrong. (Newton did surmise that light was made of particles!) But aside from that, if you don't know, you're most likely to be wrong.

Science is the realm where it's not enough to know, or to be right, but you have to be able to show that you're right, or rather, show that other ideas are wrong and the prevailing idea does the best job. Because, surprise surprise, there's a lot of data coming in from our various experiments in physics that contradict prevailing theory, and we're looking for answers but nobody has any yet.

&gt; We have learned enormous amounts about biology and biological history of the last 150 years.

Yes, but is it *science* or are we just documenting what we see?

&gt; Darwin's work has been one of the most successful productive theories in science.

Except for where it was wrong, *am I right?* Which was pretty much in every *prediction* he made. And his theory, or at least the original version of it, which had to be ""updated"" to fit our modern observations.

If you're going to claim that Darwin was just as right as Newton, then you're saying he was wrong.

&gt; Again, why would that matter? Darwin could be as wrong as Ptolemy, wrong as Galileo, wrong as Newton, it would not matter. What matters is the modern current best science.

Because Darwin was wrong. And we need to be honest with ourselves about what he got right and what he got wrong.

There are two sorts of religions in the world. On the one hand, you have those who persist in their beliefs even though they have been shown to contradict nature. This leads to all sorts of problems, not the least of which is cognitive dissonance, but it can lead to violence and worse.

Then there are the religions that say, ""Throw away the beliefs that are wrong, and embrace those that are right! Be ready to change your worldview as you learn more about the world!""

You seem to be stuck in the former religion. Having shown you, and you having admitted, that Darwin was wrong, you are clutching to your holy symbols and texts even tighter, trying to muddle out in your brain how someone can be wrong but still right at the same time.

Just let it go. Embrace reality. I promise you, it's ok to say that Darwin was wrong. Heck, you can even still be a God-denying materialist and say that Darwin was wrong! (Although, at some point, I'll have to show you how God definitely does exist, and the supernatural is absolutely a part of our universe. But that's for another time!)",1,1510243110,2017-11-09 10:58:30
210,"&gt; Books

I can't help you if you aren't willing to read books and analyze them. If you actually believed Darwin was so smart, you'd have spent your first moments reading his book. I mean, I think God is the smartest being ever, so I raise my kids reading his Book and analyzing it, and I have all but memorized key passages of it as well as the overall theme and contents of the various parts of the Book. I would've thought you would apply the same logic to your life.

As for me, I've already read Darwin, and I found him to be a product of his time, which was lazy science, speculation, and philosophizing. It reads nothing like Newton and even less like the top scientists of his day. The only reason I can see why he is so popular is because of the nascent atheist movement at the time, and their tremendous hurdle trying to disprove God since Nature herself bears such a wonderful witness to his existence and his character. But he certainly wasn't brilliant. It seems you agree with me given your lack of enthusiasm to read his works.

&gt; Evolution is the change in inherited characteristics in a population of living organism over generations. What part of that definition confuses you?

The following words confuse me, because they are not well-defined and objective:

1. change
2. inherited
3. characteristics
4. population
5. living
6. organism
7. generation

I can go further into how each of these words are ill-defined and how evolutionists have found that they don't quite apply to what you are talking about.

Let me give you an example:

1. Change: Except when things DON'T change because they have somehow hit a peak or something. (So evolution is the theory that things change until they don't anymore.)

2. Inherited: Unless you're bacteria which cross-populates genetic code. Or there are viruses that do the same.

3. Characteristics. There's two sorts of characteristics I'd be interested in, ones that don't lead to speciation (whatever that is) and ones that do. Evolutionists want you to believe that any change in characteristics is a step towards speciation. As if giving birth to a child with slightly different hair color means we're going to mutate into something else entirely, when it is just a natural variation of the species.

4. population, which includes all the creatures you want to include, and none of the ones you don't. This word is so abused that it literally means whatever you want it to mean at the time.

5. living: Does evolution apply to viruses? Are they alive? What is the definition of alive? I mean, we all ""know it when we see it"", but what objective test or measure can I apply to determine if something is alive or not?

6. organism: Why doesn't evolution apply to rocks and primordial soup? Or does it? Abiogenesis and all that. Does organism include ecosystems and such, or does it only apply to individuals? In some living things, it's almost impossible to tell when one organism begins and another ends. Again, we need an objective measure.

7. generation: Kind of ties into the whole cross-contamination of genetic code, but since we're talking about populations, how do you quantify the generation? Which generation am I a part of in *homo sapiens*, and when does the next generation begin? Do I remain a member of my generation for all time, or do I count for all generations that are alive at the time?


You've only *just begun* to define evolution.

Don't despair! In all of my many years playing with evolution, I have never seen anyone successfully define evolution with any sort of objective standard that would lend itself to be testable, let alone falsifiable. I bring up Darwin because unlike modern evolutionists, who see evolution in everything that contradicts their predictions, he actually made solid predictions, which mostly turned out to be wrong. (And BTW, you are citing *theories*, not predictions, but we can play with that later.)

&gt; Wow, you have a bachelors in physics and you think science deals in proof?

I don't recommend physics for you. You would not have a good time trying to learn it.

&gt; Congrats for knocking down another strawman.

211,"The conversation, for posterity's sake.

&gt; There's also the fact that Origin of Species came out long before a lot of the evidence that evolutionists now depend on.

213,"You've completely avoided the most important criticism: You can't both think that the mutation rates that determine an age for eve are valid but the very same approach to dating humans and our relatives is invalid. 

&gt;The consensus view is, in fact, that she was one single individual

That's simply untrue, can you reference studies that show that 1 women existed 6000 yrs ago? It's unfortunate that the mitochondrial ancestors are referred to as eve (both because of the religious connotations and that it implies one individual), perhaps that's the confusion you have over the terminology.

If you read further on the wiki page: ""One common misconception surrounding mitochondrial Eve is that since all women alive today descended in a direct unbroken female line from her, she must have been the only woman alive at the time. However, nuclear DNA studies indicate that the size of the ancient human population never dropped below tens of thousands. Other women living during Eve's time may have descendants alive today but not in a direct female line.""

&gt;Do you really think there is a substantive difference between the direct quote: ""rates inferred from evolutionary studies"" and my paraphrase: ""inferences assuming common descent""?

Here is a definition of common descent: ""Common descent describes how, in evolutionary biology, a group of organisms share a most recent common ancestor.""

Eve is the most recent matrilineal mitochondrial common ancestor. This study assumes common descent too, else how do we all share the same mitochondria? All phylogenetic studies require common descent, you can't just pick and choose when you want to apply evolutionary principles. Again, the very same techniques and analyses utilized by this paper are used to show humans are ancient and related to primates. So you can't both accept the common ancestor of mitochondria is 6000 years old and reject data that shows humans predate this time.

Evolution is the change in inherited characteristics in a population of living organism over generations. What part of that definition confuses you? 

I've defined evolution. The fact of evolution is the observed result of the category I defined. The fact of evolution includes speciation and common descent.

The theory of evolution includes three major causal factors: imperfect replication, differential reproductive success based on those imperfections, and drift.

[Yes, I have heard](http://www.icr.org/article/5657/) .  Dr. Purdom also refers to newer work by Nathaniel Jeanson (2015) which confirms the findings of Paron's team.  Do you know how the studies you have in mind answer the Parson's team's findings? 

&gt;Eve was never one person

Then what do you mean when you say, ""Before mitochondrial eve, and in contradiction with Genesis, humans existed""?  The consensus view is, in fact, that she was *one single individual,* [""the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)  You should distinguish this claim from the claim that she was one in a population of thousands because they are not synonymous.

&gt;That doesn't come from the paper, so clearly they are the words of a ""biblical creationists with a motive to favor the younger date over the older ones"".

Do you really think there is a substantive difference between the direct quote: ""rates inferred from evolutionary studies"" and my paraphrase: ""inferences assuming common descent""?  Rates inferred from evolutionary studies assume common descent.

&gt;What about the phraseology implies that they or any other biologists believe in absolute standards

As I pointed out in the OP, it is the phrase, ""the **known** age of humans.""

235,"The work is not unimportant or wrong. Any discovery that furthers human knowledge is good. What's laughable is that this claim is nothing close to a ""missing link"" in abiogenesis research because there is nothing even remotely resembling a ""chain"" present in that field. This is made obvious by the actual text of the article, which contains all of the necessary qualifiers that I originally criticized.

This science might make me feel uncomfortable if it was even *close* to explaining how life came about from non-life, but it isn't, so it doesn't. Even if it could some day be proven that life could arise from non-life (and I have little doubt that there is some way that it could), it wouldn't make me uncomfortable because all we really would have done is reverse-engineer what has already been intelligently designed.",1,1510176187,2017-11-08 16:23:07
236,haha. touche'.  very good point. ,1,1510175561,2017-11-08 16:12:41
237,What is missing here is some information about the study that Purdom and others use to support their contention that mtDNA point to a recent Eve.  That study was published in 1997 and the data collected with not direct DNA sequencing but rather RFLP analysis of the mtDNA control region.  Since 1997 we have sequence 10s of thousands of mtDNA whole genomes and can measure the mtDNA mutation rate far more accurately. That more recent work does not confirm this 1997 study but rather supports a much slower rate of mtDNA changes.  There seems to be only one reason that Purdom and others at AiG don't include the many analyses that have been done over the past 17 years and that is that it does't fit their expectations.  ,1,1510174213,2017-11-08 15:50:13
238,"&gt;when the reality is so far off that mark it's laughable

Besides for reiterating criticisms of inconsequentiality you haven't shown that this work is either unimportant or wrong. 

Sensationalistic journalism is almost never the work of a scientist. Pop-science writers and scientists are on opposite ends of the publishing spectrum (in style, content and purpose). Those that feel justified in dismissing uncomfortable science because a journalist wrote a bad article, doesn't actually mean the primary research is bad. Those that take science seriously read primary research. They don't depend on pop science and journalism.",1,1510173507,2017-11-08 15:38:27

240,"Before mitochondrial eve, and in contradiction with Genesis, humans existed. You can't both think that the mutation rates that determine an age for eve are valid but the very same approach to dating humans and our relatives is invalid. That's the most damning problem with this ""creationist proof"". Also, newer studies push the date back to ~100 000 yrs. 

&gt;So, have we all, ultimately, come from the womb of one woman? The consensus view of science is that we have.

Eve was never one person, no population model shows human numbers dropped below thousands. That's the consensus view.


&gt;*The older dates are based on inferences assuming common descent*
&gt;These are their own words, not those of biblical creationists with a motive to favor the younger date over the older ones

That doesn't come from the paper, so clearly they are the words of a ""biblical creationists with a motive to favor the younger date over the older ones"".

&gt; So why put it this way?

What about the phraseology implies that they or any other biologists believe in absolute standards? Absolute standards are reserved for maths and theists. Any biologist is willing to accept what ever theories are best evidenced. So far evolution is best evidenced...

It's really hardly even worth discussing on a forum like this one.

I'm now studying graduate level biology at an unaccredited but highly prestigious school that meets at the National Institutes of Health.

YES!  Be careful.  It happened to my personal friends.  Dr. Caroline Crocker professor of biology at George Mason (GMU) and Northern Virginia Community College NVCC was a Christian Darwinist, then upon examining the evidence, changed her mind.  She made the mistake of giving half-an hour to tell her students the truth in two universities where she taught GMU and NVCC.  She was effectively fired, but the official documents just said her contract expired and that she was an exceptional teacher and she was only let go for budgetary reasons, blah blah blah

Same happened to David Coppedge, and ENGINEER at a government aerospace outfit.  He's a personal friend.


Doc Gator was a PhD biology professor too.  The Darwinists axed his career too, and he became a truck driver.

This is a result of a Type II error: creationists think evolution is a religion, and try to use the same arguments against it. They fail, because they don't understand what they argue against.

Much like one can attack the bases of religion and disprove everything arising from it, they believe the same pattern that works against them will work against their enemies.

However, despite all claims, evolution isn't a religion: there is no divine truth, if we discover something isn't what we thought it was, we adapt. This adaptation flows back and forth, until we find what resembles reality.

Modern science isn't disconnected from the past, the phrase ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" is apt. Science changes, that's the point. So far, what we learn in every biological discipline fits into the broad framework set out in the 19th century. The overwhelming majority of scientists and academics will agree: evolution underlies biology. Now is it your position that almost all scientists and academics are ignorant or liars?

The scientific literature has extensive and comprehensive definitions, analysis and debate over these terms.

But regarding the falsification of evolution and ID, I want to point out that while a particular hypothesis (as in your bipedalism example) is difficult to falsify, it doesn't mean it can't be falsified. The technology to test a hypothesis might not yet exist, or it does, but barriers exist preventing its application. So this is in contrast to a designer explanation, because that cannot be tested (unless I'm mistaken?). 

If junk DNA made up a large percentage of our genomes, a creationist explanation would be much the same as it is for the MYH16 frame shift - our DNA was intact before the fall, and decayed thereafter...

355,"&gt; Originally the mutation was justified as the consequence of ‘the fall’, you’ve mentioned decay.

I don't see how you draw a distinction between ""the fall"" and ""decay""?  Without active maintenance, almost anything that's designed will have things go wrong with it.  Thus our load of harmful mutations.  

Is there something special about this particular mutation?  Are you saying that one single mutation gave us a gracile jaw structure, decreased jaw muscles, and a larger brain?  Would this mutation be shared by neanderthals or homo erectus?  Maybe if you could explain in more detail then I could better follow what you're saying?

Both creation and evolution have particular aspects of the theory that are non-falsifiable.  For example the evolutionary supposition that humans evolved to walk upright as a means of seeing predators further away in the grasslands.  How would you test that?

387,"&gt; An observation about what may be a population **problem** regarding a young Earth.

I wanted to revisit this because you list it as a problem. The only problem you're going to have is; you have to kill a bunch of people.

However, it is a big problem for those who support evolution.

[best documented population doubling timeline: 37 years (between 1950 and 1987)](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/)

According to one reference, you have 4,359 years since the flood.

That gives you over 117 doubling events.

That would give you a world population of 1.661535e+35. So, you have to get rid of a bunch of people.

It's speculated that [it took nearly **seven centuries** for the population to double from 0.25 billion (in the early 9th century) to 0.5 billion in the middle of the 16th century.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/)

That only gives you 6 doubling events.

2^6 = 64

If we start with 2, then the world population would be 64 people.

[Substantial differences are evident here: adding the U.S. to the graph reveals that, while the population in France roughly doubled in the period 1800-2000, in this same period the population in the U.S. increased almost 50-fold.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/)

So, you can't come up with a hard number, **but in the best documented scenario, you would need many worlds to hold that number of people.**

&gt;!

**However, this causes a ridiculous problem for evolution.**

[The **2.8 million-year-old** specimen is 400,000 years older than researchers thought that our kind first emerged.](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31718336)

If we go with the worst case scenario of 700 years per doubling event, that gives us 4000 doubling events.

2^4000 = Error

**My calculator can't calculate that number, for the worst case scenario.**

**This is quite funny.** The guy does not sound like he knows evolution. **""an error in the code""** -- that's a value judgement! There are no errors. Mutations are only bad if they harm or kill the organism. There's no other way to judge this, otherwise you would have to have an external standard of what is good and bad, what is ideal and poorly designed, and that's an anathema to blind evolution. Mutations are kept if they don't harm things. The fittest and luckiest survive, so maybe this mutation in the jaw muscle led to organisms surviving better. In fact, it must have, otherwise it wouldn't be there still. So ... self-contradition!

**muscle deficiency** haha! So there is some objective standard as to what that muscle should look like or act like? Where does this standard come from in an evolutionary world? Who's to say that it's deficient?

In fact, why are people upset when their babies are born with ""defects"" like harelips, clubfeet, birthmarks, etc. They are not defects. There is no standard - except for survival of the fittest. Maybe these are new evolutionary features and should be embraced! We have to see if these people survive better than the rest.

423,"My speculation is that the patterns of similarity are God's gift to us to help us understand ourselves.  God gave us creatures which we can dissect and experiment on so that we can understand how we function.  

When I saw all the cruel things that researchers did to mice, rats, dogs... I was for the first time grateful God made us so similar to animals that we can use animals to study how our biology works.   It would be horrific cruelty to humans if we did experiments on humans that we did on animals so that we could understand ourselves.

Sometimes it is frustrating to argue against common descent because God made us so similar to Chimps.  But then I realized he made us different enough, like Orphan Genes and Features, if one is willing to see the truth, one will see we did not descend from a common ancestor with Chimps. On the other hand we are similar enough that we can understand ourselves by studying the animals.

On a very very advanced level, I see the patterns of diversity and similarity highly important to giving road signs to important molecules of interest.   The patterns of diversity and similarity are intelligently designed to optimize scientific discovery.  For example, I was able to identify critical catalytic molecules in diverse proteins because of this pattern.

Have you looked for newer data?

[Demographic Histories of ERV-K in Humans, Chimpanzees and Rhesus Monkeys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2001186/)

[And here's an answer from a researcher](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-ERVs-do-humans-share-with-chimps):

&gt;There are are around 30 partial or full length human specific ERVs, and somewhere between 100–200 human specific solo LTRs (ERVs where the flanking LTRs have recombined, excising the coding sequence in between). Almost all of these are in the HERV-K (HML-2) clade, so they are very similar in size and sequence; a solo LTR is about 1 kilobase long, and a full length HML-2 provirus is about 10 kb. 30x10kb+200kb=500 kb, so there’s a max of about 500,000 base pairs of human specific ERV sequence; the vast, vast majority of the rest is also found in chimps.

There are confounding factors:

* ERVs move: there are questions about how they all evolved, and it's suspected a number were transposing code that became pathogenic. This can make them difficult to identify.

* ERVs degrade: there are more broken ERVs than functional ones in the genome, and once they break enough, they become difficult to differentiate from junk coding.

* ERVs fracture: sometimes, they come apart and become two ERVs. Is that one ERV or two?

https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2uky07/math_and_creationism_6000_years_120_generations_7/

""The number that counts is not how long people live but how long they take to reproduce. so 20 or 25 probably a more sensible number to plug into that equation. giving you 240 - 300 generations. to get from 2 to 7 billion in 240 generations you need a population growth of between 9.9% in every generation. In an ideal world where every child lived long enough to reproduce this would require every woman to have 2.2 children. If only 50% of children lived long enough to reproduce then you'd need 4.4 children per family, which is not at all unreasonable.""

**""Ignoring generations, just on compound interest alone you only need an annual population growth of 0.37% sustained for 6000 years to get to 7 billion people.""**

""Or you could look up the actual formulas that statisticians use to model human population growth. But really just because the numbers can be made to work does not mean the idea is at all sensible.""

466,"Are you equating celebrating a lifestyle with tolerating it? There's a huge difference. I am not asking you to celebrate the Christian lifestyle; I don't need your acceptance. I simply ask you to tolerate me.

The gay agenda, when you dig deep into it and apply simple logic, is anti-gay, one of the worst things you can do to both straight and gay people. Of course they oppose the gay agenda, because the gay agenda is opposing humanity and common decency. The gay agenda tells men and women that because of some sexual tendencies they are different than the rest of humanity, that they are broken or marred in some way that makes them corrupt and never can they ever be like ""normal"" human beings again. The gay agenda divides the human race into ""gay"" and ""straight"" and says that unless the ""straight"" humans behave a certain way, then they must hate the ""gay"" humans, thus turning both ""straight"" and ""gay"" into some kind of slave to the other.

The Christian message is all are alike before God; we all sin, we are all fallen, but we can all be redeemed by Christ Jesus. ""Gay"" or ""straight"" we are brothers and sisters in Christ, who is one with God.

&gt; repenting amounts to asking them to stop being gay.

You need to go back and read about what that word ""repent"" means. It is much more than just ""stop doing bad things"". It is turning your entire life over to God, to do the things God wants instead. Homosexuals are not special; *all* mankind has a great need to repent. Everyone must repent before they can embrace the gospel.

Christ rejects all who do not repent, regardless of their sins, no matter how minor or major.

&gt;It is *not* common knowledge.

Are you serious? I know that the news makes homosexual intolerance in Christianity seem more widespread than it is but there's more than a grain of truth to it. You'd practically have to live on another planet to think otherwise. 

Every freaking election the Democratic strategists stir up and fracture the Republican party on abortion and gay marriage. There is a huge percentage of Christian Americans that will not vote for a candidate that isn't against gay marriage. That is common knowledge.

Not to mention I have immediate family attending various Baptist/Free Methodist/Protestant Churches (they've bounced around) and they can't stop talking about ""fighting the gay agenda."" I grew up in Churches hearing about the evils of homosexuality.

&gt;Name ONE CHRISTIAN SECT that would never accept a homosexual as a fellow member if they proclaimed faith in Christ and **repented of their sins**, and accepted the tenets of that sect.

Emphasis mine - basically, repenting amounts to asking them to stop being gay. Technically, they just have to stop engaging in homosexual acts or having homosexual relationships. Back in the closet you go! 

So yea, technically no Christian sect would reject a **former** homosexual. Great point. /s 

&gt;Now, I expect you to apologize for mischaracterizing Christianity and misunderstanding our most basic tenets, tenets that pretty much all of us agree on. I expect you to stop talking about these things until you've had a chance to get more than a passing understanding of the Bible and Christianity as a whole.

477,"&gt; As Sherlock Holmes would say, once you eliminate all the impossibilities, whatever is left, no matter how improbable, is the truth.

If we’re going with Sherlock Holmes, then; “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”

“So the **observer who has thoroughly understood** one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.”

The actual scientific observation, based on the current laws of physics, is that all galaxies, clusters and superclusters, aren’t in sustained orbits; they’re flying apart. The laws of physics allows us to “link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.”

So, why do we ignore the scientific observation? Sherlock Holmes would allow us to ignore observation.

The scientific term for dark matter is, “fudge factor.” A fudge factor is a calculation adjustment to change observation, to agree with the hypothesis. **Yes, dark matter is listed as an example**, if you look the term up on Wikipedia.

After billions of dollars, for experiments; the fudge factor just ain’t there. 

Is there a chance we might entertain the notion that what we see, based on the current laws of physics, is what we see? Not a chance because that gives us a young universe, and there goes evolution’s timeline.

The research this article reports on is setting an upper bound to what Dark Matter could be. A whole lot of theories about what it *could* be are now nonsense, impossibilities. As we whittle down all the possibilities, eventually, there will be one left standing, or they will all go away.

When it comes to cosmology, I am in the camp of ""I have no clue what is happening out there,"" and I've earned my BS in Physics. I am actually considering the theory that maybe there is a giant piece of cloth with holes in it, or maybe we're in a giant sphere. *How can we disprove that?* Or do we just dismiss these ideas because they sound silly?

This is how insane cosmology is today. Anyone who tells you that they know what is happening out beyond the earth's atmosphere is lying to you. *We have no clue!*",1,1509578331,2017-11-01 19:18:51

It is *not* common knowledge.

Name ONE CHRISTIAN SECT that would never accept a homosexual as a fellow member if they proclaimed faith in Christ and repented of their sins, and accepted the tents of that sect. It doesn't exist!

The problem with your surveys and such is that they aren't asking the right questions. I've given you a very general, very much accepted definition of Christianity that I can't imagine anyone disagreeing with, and you're arguing that I am not representing Christianity as a whole. And yet you've already claimed that you don't know much about the Bible or the Christian religion.

I'm telling you, if you are ignorant of Christianity, you shouldn't talk about it. You shouldn't pretend to know what we think, feel, and believe. You shouldn't accept the characterization of us made by people who don't like us as valid. And certainly, you shouldn't spread it.

This is objectively false. Muslim alchemists were incredibly advanced -- they had real science, to call them alchemists denigrates them. Then the Mongols came and, as we all know, Mongols love to fuck shit up.

Could have been a very different world if that didn't happen, either.

&gt; Yes, that's the new revisionist history thinking.

No, I'm talking pure hypothetical. If Christianity didn't take hold, the next major contender might have been Zoroastrian beliefs, which were fairly widespread and not all that similar. I don't know if Islam would have arisen without Christianity -- it certainly wouldn't be the same religion -- but that might still have happened.

We literally don't know how the world would look without Christianity. It's been two thousand years -- literally everything would be different. I think I can safely assume that not a single country that exists today would exist unchanged -- Christianity had substantial interactions with the Roman Empire that confound our ability to project.

I suspect it would be more or less the same. Along with the end of the Islamic Golden Age, religious repression seems to have been a major stifling force on our acquisition of knowledge, so maybe more decentralized religion would have helped that. But the Mongols were still coming, probably.

But I don't know. It's a lot of variables and it's barely a meaningful question, given we can't actually change the outcome.",1,1509570191,2017-11-01 17:03:11

The way I like to think of cells and genomes is that there are no ‘units.’  **There are just systems all the way down.**](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/05/07/the-evolution-paradigm-shift/)

&gt; Then what do we know about how instincts work from a genetic or **biochemical level.**

Physiology addresses that: [Physiology Intro Chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euSkfZhS6Dw) **Can’t recommend this enough**. It’ll blow your mind, so be careful. Really, I had to sit back and laugh. Intelligence is stored at the atom level; state of an Atom.

The early chapters cover how intelligence is stored in various atoms. The state of the atoms, the number of electrons, protons, etc, all have to be taken into consideration because different states produce different shapes. Some instinctive reactions, on a cellular level, don’t go through the brain; part of the built-in intelligent responses.

&gt;!

Another thing that falls under the category of “instinct,” is Phenotypic plasticity; “Developmental plasticity is the capacity of organisms to develop altered phenotypes in reaction to different environmental conditions.

27,"Thanks for taking the time for a very detailed response.

&gt; Yes, if you look at things only from the point of view of the senses, a table is just a table.

Using only our senses, we’ll have limited ability to formulate an opinion on the table. But, we have the ability to perceive, learn, reason and understand what a table is, and its uses. Our interactions, with the table, give no logical reason to go beyond picturing the table as anything but a table.

&gt; So a table, aside from particular table X, it is also an abstract idea that is nevertheless real.

I’d put that different. We have stored intelligence about the concept of what a table is. Stored intelligence isn’t an abstract thing, but it’s a real mechanical reality. We know that the stored information isn’t the same thing as the external object.

&gt; Similarly, a number is an idea that is present in all its instantiations, but does never diminish.  

We have the ability to connect stored information with other stored information. An actual physical connection is made in our brain. 

&gt; Also, from another point of view, a table is an object with a function and the function of ""being used as a table"" can migrate to other objects as well, such as a stone slab on the ground. The tableness of the table is not lost when supplanting it with a stone slab because the tableness is also a function.

Intelligence on what a table is and Intelligence on its uses is stored in our brain. We may need a table and reason that another object may serve the purpose of a table. But this is based on stored intelligence of what a table is and its uses.

To picture a table as “symbols of a higher concept” **requires an external input**. We can’t derive that from stored intelligence of what a table is, and its uses. If someone tells us that objects have “a higher concept,” and we accept that; then it’s stored as intelligence in our brain associated with all objects.

&gt; You can also deny the reality of the mind and say that ideas are not like things, they are just illusions, but then you won't have science, theories, anything more than plain sense perception.

I had to laugh when I read that. Not at you or what you said, but **a lot of, what’s called science, is based on that very thing.**

Einstein listed Hume as his biggest influence. [**Hume** argued that he was unable to find any sensible idea—his word was impression—of a “self” or “mind” in which ideas were supposed to be received.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-anthropology/The-way-of-ideas) (page 2)

Hume also did away with cause and effect. In industrial and medical science, you look for the cause of an effect. Under Einstein’s, Hume inspired, rules; you can’t discern the effect; you invent it. Einstein: [… he looks upon the concepts and **theories as free inventions** of the human spirit (**not logically derivable** from what is empirically given)](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/)

So, Einstein’s special relativity is just something he invented; with variable space and time. 

Lorentz’s theory of relativity is [**experimentally indistinguishable** from special relativity, Lorentz' theory is **no longer used for reasons of ""philosophical preference""** …](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_speed_of_light)

As far the non-moving part of reality, that is indeed accounted for in Sankhya but not in this particular article. It is God which is that reality behind everything, the source of both conscious souls and the reality ""external"" to the souls which they perceive. And how that reality is organized it is described by Ashish Dalela in the book [Six Causes: The Vedic Theory of Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Causes-Vedic-Theory-Creation/dp/8193052331/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=), which is a great read if you are inclined towards creationism and ID. In chapter 9: The Nature of God's Power, there is an extensive presentation of the intricacies of Vedic theology as it relates to what you are refering to as a ""non-moving"" point. But that's another discussion. Here is a taste from the book description, to give you an idea of how Indian philosophy can analyze creation:

""The Personal Cause of Creation explores the properties of consciousness, its quest for meaning and self-knowledge and how that quest forms the basis for the creation of the universe.

The Efficient Cause of Creation describes the mechanism by which the quest for meaning gradually becomes thoughts, desires, judgments, plans and actions, thereby creating various experiences.

The Instrumental Cause of Creation discusses the Vedic view on the senses, mind, intelligence and ego as the instruments that experience meanings, and embed meanings into matter.

The Formal Cause of Creation describes the nature of meanings and how these meanings are created as subtle information and then embedded into space-time to create differentiated objects.

The Systemic Cause of Creation explains how information in the mind is transformed into energy which is then represented into matter as sound vibrations denoting meanings.

The Material Cause of Creation describes how information is encoded as vibrations in space-time, and how modifications of these vibrations create other observable physical properties.""

&gt;At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated.

But if everything is more than simply what it is, then how do you derive this concept? This requires that you have prior knowledge of the concept because you can’t derive it from yourself, or any object, because you, and all objects, have a higher concept. So, you don’t have a non-moving reality point to establish the overall scheme of objects. Ultimately, this comes down to just an opinion.

[This biologist](http://phys.org/news/2013-02-bacterial-world-impacting-previously-thought.html) says :  ""I am... convinced that the number of beneficial microbes, even very necessary microbes, is much, much greater than the number of pathogens.""

In such a case, immune systems would exist just to keep microbes from getting where they're not supposed to be.  But why are there so many human-specific harmful pathogens?  A good number of them [have lost](http://discovermagazine.com/2011/apr/16-interview-lynn-margulis-not-controversial-right) what they would otherwise need to be free living:

1.  ""Both the treponema that cause syphilis and the borrelia that cause Lyme disease contain only a fifth of the genes they need to live on their own. Related spirochetes that can live outside by themselves need 5,000 genes, whereas the spirochetes of those two diseases have only 1,000 genes in their bodies. The 4,000 missing gene products needed for bacterial growth can be supplied by wet, warm human tissue. This is why both the Lyme disease borrelia and syphilis treponema are symbionts—they require another body to survive.""

Likewise we [see that](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/medicine_04) ""[some] primates with SIV and wild cats with FIV don't seem to be harmed by the viruses they carry""

However we creationists don't yet understand some microbial pathogens.  Malaria has specialized machinery used for its infection cycle and nobody has any ideas for any other purpose for it.  Perhaps in time we will, or perhaps there is a second creator who is not benevolent.

depersonalization-derealization syndrome: [Depersonalization is described as feeling disconnected or estranged from one's self. Individuals experiencing depersonalization may report feeling as if they are an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions.[1] In some cases, individuals may be unable to accept their reflection as their own, or they may have out-of-body experiences.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization_disorder)

No. In this case, the donor was not another animal -- the donor was a virus. The recipient was a reptile-thing. The majority of HGTs are viral in origin, as they have the mechanisms to write themselves into an organism's genetic code.

The change between mammals and non-mammals was that we took a protein they used to join cell membranes, which would be used to deliver their genetic material to the host cell. This protein was expressed and repurposed: it allowed the mother to connect her bloodstream to the embryo, holding the egg connected internally rather than being laid in a nest. This punctuated change, which likely would have taken only a few generations, would open up new niches and we would expect rapid changes to occur after such an event as the behaviour of the organism will change substantially to accommodate live birth.

If I had to speculate, this was a sexually transmitted infection, based on where it is expressed.

96,"&gt;The basic idea was simple: the more closely related two species are (or the more recently their branches on the tree split), the more alike their DNA, RNA and protein sequences ought to be.

And they do, once you discard the HGTs, which by definition have no origin within the tree progression but are still traceable through the tree. I quoted a section from your article on the subject on the subject of tracing the non-HGT elements in much of the current assembly of life -- from humans to molds, which is remarkable that we still share any code after this length of time. HGTs do not invalidate the tree of life, they are in fact rather central to understanding the branching.

As an example: mammals evolved from something else, likely a reptile of sort, though the term reptile is probably inappropriate. If a virus was responsible for that change, as we believe, it doesn't change that it evolved. It doesn't change that the first mammal is still descended from, and had much of the genetics, of the organism that directly preceded it.

It also doesn't change that we can trace the difference in key mammal sequences to estimate how long ago that occurred based on standard genetic drift.

2) No reasonable creationist can deny that microevolution occurs, the main issue is with the longevity of evolution and universal common descent.  By this logic, supporting microevolution as true should support eugenics and be evil, but I think we'd agree that that makes no sense.

Yes, HGTs are predicted to produce rapid evolutionary events, and ERVs are a form of HGT. The jump to carrying and birthing live young is believed to have been caused by an ERV.

This would lead to very rapid evolutionary changes and long term conservation. But we do actually know that many are actually broken.

When your children inherit these HGTs from you, they might receive mutations of them. These behave according to inheritance rules from here on out, and we can run estimates based on the divergence.

This one was:

&gt;The battle came to a head in 2006. In an ambitious study, a team led by Peer Bork of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany, examined 191 sequenced genomes from all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (complex organisms with their genetic material packaged in a nucleus) - and **identified 31 genes that all the species possessed and which showed no signs of ever having been horizontally transferred. They then generated a tree by comparing the sequences of these ""core"" genes in everything from E. coli to elephants. The result was the closest thing yet to the perfect tree, Bork claimed** (Science, vol 311, p 1283).

Once we eliminate genes that are likely to be subject to horizontal transfer, we can once again form the tree of life, as predicted. This would be the expected outcome under evolutionary theory.

So:

&gt;My question is this: when we compare genes of family trees whose history we know (say, of human brothers , sisters, cousins, etc. or even of domesticated dogs) do we see this same kind of conflicting story in the genes? 

No, you won't: this article highlights the important of Horizontal Gene Transfer.

&gt; Both he and Doolittle are at pains to stress that downgrading the tree of life doesn't mean that the theory of evolution is wrong - just that evolution is not as tidy as we would like to believe.

At last, after zillions of dollars spent on research, we've proven the theory is absolutely false.

So, this is real simple, we have a falsified theory, end the story.

Not so fast, the good doctors tell us that we must still believe!

[Despite the fact that Social Darwinism bears Charles Darwin's name, it is also linked today with others, notably Herbert Spencer, Thomas Malthus, and Francis Galton, the founder of eugenics. In fact, Spencer was not described as a social Darwinist until the 1930s, long after his death.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism)

Francis Galton was Darwin’s cuz, and father of Eugenics. 

In “Descent of Man,” Darwin addresses the subject; (title: **Natural Selection As Affecting Civilised Nations**; “I have hitherto only considered the advancement of man from a semi-human condition to that of the modern savage. But some remarks on the **action of natural selection on civilised nations** may be worth adding.” 

**Darwin then gives credit to the fathers of Eugenics**, and quotes them. “This subject has been ably discussed by Mr. W. R. Greg, and previously by Mr. Wallace and Mr. Galton. **Most of my remarks are taken from these three authors.**”

160,"Yeah, and eugenic programs in Tuskegee Alabame gave black people STD's.

What's your point? Are you assuming all thoughts on evolution follow the same ideology? I know people who take up snakes in their church service. I guess that means you do too, since Christianity is all the same, right? It's not like there are different schools of thought on evolution, they're all the same apparently. (And all stuck in... 1927?)

Another comparison:  

Fraud was an egotistical buffoon. Yet a lot of his ideas were on the right track. His student Jung took those ideas, and helped correct them. Same today, psychologists have taken Jung's work and further perfected it. That's how science works. Someone comes up with an idea that can be tested, maybe? Someone tests it some more, changes it based on evidence. Someone else scrutinizes that work, adds more evidence, the conclusion corrects some things, sometimes completely scrapping it. Unfortunately, evidence for evolution to various degrees has proven as true. Science is trying to understand the degrees, but it does appear that abiogenesis through water to land and into gradually advancing creatures is the correct answer. 

When Darwin was first observing evolution, he knew very little compared to what we have learned today. Darwin was an ignorant fool. So was Fraud. Just because they were fools doesn't mean they weren't on the right track. The both observed something that was light upon our feet. Today we have a greater understanding of that light and that light has unlocked many other great understandings that are helping us get an image of creation that is more complete.

The hardline stance science takes on evolution is only in the evidence that has been presented and proven true. We know things change, change is inevitable. We've witnessed firsthand some remarkable changes in genetics within a species such as butterflies, insects, bacteria and viruses. If evolution weren't true, we'd be using the same flu vaccine every year. We can't because [the virus keeps mutating and evolving.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm)

The media takes the evidence and the conclusions made by some scientists and twist it into their own conclusions. The media makes wild sweeping allegations, editorializing things in order to get attention and stir the pot.

Ms Crocker wasn't fired. The university had no obligation to keep her. Their decision was based on the numerous complaints the university received because of her own bias. It did not ruin her career. She only wants to be seen as a martyr. There are institutions such as [Bryan College](http://www.bryan.edu/) that would hire her is she is qualified. After all, they have [forced their faculty to swear that evolution is not true and that Adam and Eve are historical persons that were created by God and not by already existing genetic material.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/06/professors-and-students-bryan-college-protest-changes-statement-faith) Honestly, Bryan college sounds like the perfect place for your friend, and Tennessee is beautiful and Chattanooga is a world class city. 

So while it is understandable why you have the position that you do, your position doesn't take other considerations into account. 

The university she teaches at has a right to decide what curriculum is best taught. Concepts such as ""souls"" (which I do personally believe in) should not be taught as science unless you can utilize the scientific method in presenting souls as evidence. Otherwise you and your friend are guilty of the same thing you are accusing others of doing. She was teaching unscientific concepts that were not based on evidence but instead were based on personal and biased belief. 

And like this truth or not, there are creationists whose ideas have led to the deaths of the innocent and have been used to support slavery. It's hypocritical to attack one belief while lifting up your own beliefs that have had similar consequences. And finally, eugenics is outlawed.

Typically, if used to disprove evolution, this comes down to a fundamental misunderstanding of *The Selfish Genome*.  While, yes, our **genes** benefit from eugenics and survival of the fittest, why in the world would anyone model their ethical system after what our **genes** need?  In fact, if you are arguing that evolution is false because of Social Darwinism, then since most YECs accept microevolution then they must subscribe to eugenics, because it's what microevolution would entail for the human race.  However, nobody argues that, because it makes no sense to associate a natural process with an ethical system.  

If you're instead arguing that Darwin was a racist, then ok.  There are two issues though.  First of all, most people were racist at this time, so it's really not that amazing.  Second of all, it has no affect on the truth value to evolution.  You're mixing the ""poisoning the well"" fallacy, as well as the genetic fallacy if you claim this.  

I accuse stcordova of dishonesty because, if I am not mistaken, he has been corrected on the lack of a relationship between social Darwinism or Darwin's personal views and the theory of evolution before.  Thus, if he would use the same argument for an audience he thinks won't disagree with him as he did for an audience that corrected him, he would most probably be using a dishonest argument intentionally.

I'm saying that if any succession of small changes leads to significant differences from the source, regardless of what that looks like, then that means macroevolution has occurred. (And we're going to run into definition problems here because I'm not 100% sure what you mean by macro-ev, sounds like it might have something to do with information, which is similarly nebulous. I've been thinking of it in terms of speciation, which in this analogy might be something like, oh I don't know, a change of subject?). 

And I get it, you think it's too complicated and difficult to occur, which is fine. But in that sense I'd stick with a different analogy like monkeys and typewriters, it's pithy and gets your point across that random inputs won't turn into Melville. I may not agree with it but I understand the model.

As for the Felps, I don't understand your criticism. Random variation and environmental pressure led to large changes in the organism and eventually speciation. If that to you is micro-ev, then ok, all life we see today is the result of micro-ev, it's just semantics at this point. You also seemed to assume the Felps are somehow less complex, and ignored all the abilities gained by the Felps over time, do they not count? It seems like an upward spiral towards a better environmental fit to me.  And also, for the record, I never included complexity in my examples because in the end, it just doesn't matter. More complexity isn't a goal of evolution (there is none) and can be a burdensome waste of energy in the right environment. 

And back to Peleg. Again, all your examples of 'adding information' seemed hand picked to appear ridiculous, which makes sense because you had a specific goal in mind. You never responded to my example of doubling the word 'pull' or misspelling words into other words, which is added information and which would pass editorial scrutiny. It changes ever so slightly the semantic meaning but it doesn't make it worse.

My only criticism of this analogy is that the starting information is too simple to represent the difficulty involved in macroevolution.  Even the simplest cell is an incredibly complex creature, but macroevolution goes so far as to propose that something as complicated as a cow could evolve into a whale.  Therefore, I feel that my analogy of one novel becoming another represents this reality better.    


I love the alternate version of my tale of the Phelps clan :)  My criticism here is confined to pointing out that what you propose could be answered by natural selection acting on available information in the genome without resorting to random mutations for new information.  It is microevolution, analogous to the different breeds of dog we see.  I believe in specialization.  It is observable, but losing an ability (here the ability/desire to reproduce with the other Phelps descendants) is not what leads to macroevolution.

You don't think it works this way, non-creationists don't think it works this way, so it doesn't seem to do the work an analogy should. Are you asking me how I *do* think evolution works? I can try to tweak the analogy a bit....let's see:

The cow jumps over the moon. For whatever reason, a writer with clumsy fingers has to type this sentence over and over again, starting from the last accepted sentence he wrote. There's an editor whose only job is to make sure any combination of letters is in the dictionary. The writer makes mistake after mistake, adding random letters, typing the wrongs ones, mixing up the order of things, etc etc. The editor keeps sending it back until the writer gets it almost right, except he's replaced an m with an l. It gets the green light and the process continues. A bit later it happens again, he types n instead of w. Green light. Now the writer is typing 'The con jumps over the loon' over and over again. You can see the similarities to the initial sentence, but it unmistakably has a new and different meaning. And as time goes on the sentence being written gets farther and farther away from what it was at the beginning.

Let's try the Phelps clan:

The Phelps are displaced from their coastal habitat from some environmental pressure. Some Phelps head out to the water, some go inland to the forest, and some head down the coastline to a similar habitat. Those in the water, well, they drown. They can only swim so long. But the Phelps that head into the forest survive, they find some meager food, some shelter, they breed, but it's a hard life and many don't survive. Their offspring grow, some are bigger than others, some are smaller, and amazingly the smaller find it easier to survive the dangers of the forest; climbing trees, finding food, avoiding predators, etc. It's easier to provide for a family. The smaller forest Phelps, or Felps, have more children. Some are bigger, and some are smaller, but on average all the Felps are just a tad bit smaller than the generation before. A million years later a curious Felp leaves the trees and encounters a coastal Phelp who looks nearly unchanged being well suited to his environment. But he looks utterly alien to the Felp, who is now very small with long fingers to grip branches and a jaw more suited to crack nuts than eat fish, and who wouldn't know how to swim out of a puddle. Not in a million years would the two think to breed with each other, if it was even possible at this point.  Bam, speciation!

I'd argue that these more accurately represent the process of evolution (at least as I understand it) though, being abstractions, they obviously can't encompass everything.",3,1505919625,2017-09-20 11:00:25

In my view of the story, it's really simple. God sees all, and knows all (including what will come to pass). He knew Peter would betray him because he already knows what will happen in the future. No alternative realities, no butterfly effects, no surprises possible. A very simple explanation.

The way you describe your version of god is kinda unusual, because you are placing limits on his omniscience. You claim the garden was built to last forever, and that it was human free will that foiled that plan. Directly implying your god failed to account for free will properly.

However the analogies you've created here, the writer and the editor, the Phelps clan, it seems like you've created them to explain how *you* believe *I* think evolution occurs. The problem is I, and probably most other non-creationists, don't think of evolution in this way. 

I don't think a book would change through minor errors and edits from Old Man and the Sea to Moby Dick. The scenario you gave sounds just as preposterous to me as it does to you. I also don't think the Phelps clan would become sea creatures by being displaced, that's a ludicrous suggestion as you point out. And it's no where near how I understand evolution to operate.

So it really comes down to what your goal is with these analogies. Is it to understand better how non-creationists actually think about how evolution works? I'd argue these analogies don't do a great job at that.  Is it to show how silly non-creationists are and how they believe stupid things?

Genesis 22:12 - God is like, I gotta test my boy Abraham out to make sure he is good and Abraham passes.  God states in no uncertain terms that he **NOW** knows Abraham is cool 

Ex 4:8 - God is all like.  Dang, these people are stupid, so If they don't get the first sign, maybe they'll get the second 

Exodus 13:17 - God is all formulating battle plans and clearly states that the Egyptians might return if XYZ. 

Exodus 16:14 - God is testing people with Mana from Heaven.  (Lets face it, the 40 years in the desert was not a good time for Humanity.) 

I have plenty more examples if you would like, but the Bible is very very clear about the Free Will of humans and how it is constantly messing everything up.

235,"&gt;I think, your rules for the editor aren't very clear

I think you are right, so I'll try to clarify here.  

The editors edit out what detracts from the intelligibility of the story as natural selection edits out what is not favorable to survival.  Minor deletions etc., when they do not affect a sentence’s intelligibility or the integrity of the narrative as a whole may be overlooked.  Even changes that do detract from the story’s intelligibility in minor ways (misspellings, for instance) may be missed by the editors.  The introduction of new characters, however, or the germs of new plot lines which have no context in the rest of the story are glaring problems.  The more glaring, the more incoherent in terms of the story as a whole and thus the greater likelihood of their being eliminated by the editors.   Therefore, major/macro changes in the story would not occur. 

If you want an example of the principle as it applies to evolution, here is something I wrote in another thread:

""Let’s say there is a tribe of coastal people. In this tribe is the Phelps clan, mighty swimmers all, very useful for harvesting bounty from the sea. Then one day, another tribe migrates to the area and begins to drain off the first tribe’s resources. Their traditional homeland cannot support both tribes. The first tribe must do something, but what? They will either fight or leave. If they fight and win, the pressure is gone; no change of environment is necessary. If they die fighting, they will not reproduce; no evolution for them. If they leave, where will they go? Either further down the coast or inland. They will certainly not head out to sea (unless by ships to some other piece of land). Anything that can be called pressure is, especially on an evolutionary timescale, immediate. These people do not have millions of years to wait while drawing upon the Phelps gene pool to transform the population by slow, unguided degrees into something like porpoises. Even if they embarked on an aggressive program of selective, artificial breeding for the express purpose, they would not make it in time. That is one of the glaring problems with the Darwinian proposal of moving from a land animal to a deep sea one. All pressures to move from one environment to another (other animals, drought, famine, even climate change) will be relatively immediate and will require relatively quick solutions.""

Thus, the Phelps clan will remain humans, just as *The Old Man and the Sea* will remain *The Old Man and the Sea.*  Editorial/Natural Selection will see to it.

&gt;It seems that you (un)intentionally picked examples that would help prove your point and ignored ones that might hurt it. And that's a very big deal.

In point of fact, I selected this sentence because I wanted to mutate ""up leg"" to ""peleg"".  Had I tried to generate something appropriate randomly, I fear I would have never succeeded. The irony that I had to resort to design in order to illustrate evolution is not lost on me, but I think it serves to illustrate my point even more.  If anything, I gave more credit to the process of evolution than it deserves.

&gt;First of all, the seed sentences are difficult enough to parse in the first place sans context,

I think you are right again here.  The context is that the old man, Santiago, is out on the open sea in his little fishing boat struggling to land a huge marlin and he is exhorting his body to hold up under the strain.  Once you realize this, perhaps you can see why relatively small changes in the sentence that do not affect its grammatical integrity or the overall plot could easily remain in the text, whereas new characters appearing out of context on the boat (or potential murder mysteries) would easily be caught by the editors and removed.

262,"I would fund Ashish Dalela's research into the place of meaning in science (emphasis mine):

https://www.ashishdalela.com/2014/06/10/areas-semantic-research/

""There are many path-breaking areas of research at the **nexus of meaning and matter**. I am particularly interested in the following areas, with the specifics described below.

The problems of quantum physics are legend, but the solution to these problems is still not known. My angle to research in quantum theory is that **quanta are not things, but symbols. Symbols have semantic properties that make them behave like concepts, rather than things.** The paradoxes of quantum theory vis-a-vis classical physics are problems in understanding how concepts behave differently than classical particles.

I believe that current quantum theory requires a new mathematical formulation that derives the physical aspects of quanta from their semantic aspects. This new semantic theory will come from attempts to incorporate meanings within mathematics.

Number Theory

There is no area in science where the problems of meaning can be stated more succinctly and demonstrated more clearly than mathematics. The history of mathematical development is replete with paradoxes such as Godel’s Incompleteness, the Burali-Forti Paradox, Zeno’s Paradox, Tarski’s Undecidability, etc. These paradoxes arise through a curious mingling of everyday concepts and numbers. Mathematics uses many notions about numbers, but is unable to distinguish between them.

I believe that **mathematics requires a new theory of numbers where numbers are known as types rather than quantities (types in everyday language denote concepts rather than quantities; numbers should also be treated as types – i.e. concepts).** Attempts to include types in mathematics have led to paradoxes because types are derived from quantities, based on the idea that the world is primarily objects from which we construct meanings. The inverse proposition – that the world is meanings from which objects are created – is free from paradoxes, and represents a different foundation for mathematics.

The Nature Of Chemical Law

The central dogma in modern chemistry is that it can be reduced to the study of atoms, which are described using quantum theory. Since quantum equations cannot be accurately solved for any molecule that has more than a couple of subatomic particles, the dogma has hindered the development of a theory of reactions. Chemists use a wide variety of intuitions in chemical understanding but hardly any predictive laws exist.

I believe that chemistry deals with structures which have additional properties when atoms are treated as symbols of meaning. Structural meanings cannot be reduced to the properties described by quantum theory, and chemical reactions are governed by laws unknown so far. **These laws will be understood through a study of semantic structures, in analogy to grammar, which creates new meanings using structures.**

Biological Intentionality

Evolutionary theory in biology claims that the diversity of species comes from DNA mutation and its replication. However, DNA replication does not have a sound theory behind it. Ordinary chemical molecules like water and salt do not replicate. What causes the DNA to replicate, and what type of phenomena does replication denote? Additionally, what properties in molecules make them descriptions of other molecules? Matter, in the classical sense, is at best a structure, and not a description of other objects. **The DNA molecule, however, is a description of much of the body’s organization. Like the table of contents references the chapters in a book, the DNA too describes the body succinctly. New properties in matter are required to understand how a material object can be an abstract representation of something more detailed.**

I believe that DNA replication represents a new class of intentional phenomena in which one molecule is a description of another molecule. Biologists freely talk about information in biology in the sense that the DNA encodes meaning, but the representational properties of meaning have no explanation. DNA replication and transcription correspond to a new type of property in matter where one object describes another object.

Semantic Computing

The failure of artificial intelligence (AI) to elicit intelligent tasks such as language comprehension (leave alone creativity, problem solving and metaphorical thinking) has led most scientists to recognize that computers cannot deal with meaning. Why? Because a token in the computer has physical properties but no meaning; the programmer supplies that meaning during designing, writing and testing programs. **In what way is the human mind able to design, write and test programs that a computer cannot? How does a human mind fix problems in a computer program when Turing’s Halting problem proves that it is impossible to write a program that will detect the program’s problems?**

Advances in semantic computing depend on advances in mathematics and physics where a symbol can denote types besides quantities. Computing theory has an important role in delineating the necessary types for different classes of problems. In other words, semantic computing is about finding the elementary symbols and operations (i.e. language) using which any arbitrary semantic program can be written, compiled, and executed.""",2,1505814482,2017-09-19 05:48:02

Being that the theory, stated in the most basic terms, is that something from outside our universe is responsible for creating our universe...

277,"Alright! I'm just going to try and stay in the constraints of the analogy itself for this.

So what pops out to me first is the potential variations you give under each category. (First of all, the seed sentences are difficult enough to parse in the first place sans context, a simple sentence may be better to use?) It seems that you (un)intentionally picked examples that would help prove your point and ignored ones that might hurt it. And that's a very big deal.

Lets take the first set.  I don't know what you mean by information, and don't want to get into that debate, but if it has anything do with *meaning* then your first examples have drastically changed the meaning while retaining their coherence, although it seems like you are implying the deletions hurt the sentences some how. Instead, they are just different, and I can go one further: ""Pull hands. Hold legs. Head last"". Just through deletion I've turned it into a grisly murder mystery! :-p  If it stays like that, it won't be caught by the editor (I think, your rules for the editor aren't very clear) but it will be very different from it's parent. How is that not a ""macro"" change?

On the second set that add information, I don't understand why they are all non-sensical, and why we assume the editor won't catch it. How about this variation: Pull, pull, hands. (etc.).  Pull was doubled, but the whole thing remains coherent. It adds emphasis to the word, very slightly changing meaning. Or maybe a letter swap that changes a word, ""Full, hands. (ect.)"" Still makes sense, no? These seem like reasonable changes that add information that wouldn't be caught by an editor.

So, by following the rules of the analogy I've created variations that add, change, or subtract bits, that would pass editorial muster, and that form new baseline sentences that could then be subject to further changes. How far would these changes have to go to qualify as a macro change? And what's stopping these changes from getting to that point in an iterative process?

285,"I am going to assume you are being sincere. If that's not the case, let me know so I won't waste my time.

Two points are being discussed here: First, the Anthropic Principle, which is that the reason why the universe is the way it is is because it's the only universe that allows observation to occur. That is, even though the laws of physics say the universe is highly improbable, because we are here, we just got lucky, because if we didn't get lucky we wouldn't be here.

The second topic is whether the current understanding of physics predicts the universe as it is or whether it predicts something else.

I'll take the second point first because it really is the foundation for the first. That is, if the universe we live in is the most likely possibility, then the whole first argument is moot.

In physics, we have several problems. One, the basic universal constants simply *are* and no one can say *why* they are. Two, several different laws we have discovered dictate that it's practically 0 likelihood that the universe exists in any state other than the final state.

The first argument is the fine-tuning argument, what has been said by leading Atheists to be the strongest argument in favor of the existence of God. Basically, the constants are not random, but they are set by a being who knew exactly what he was doing, and wanted to create a universe that could sustain life. If we assume that the constants are set randomly for different universes, then the probability that the constants would be set exactly the way they are, or close enough that we'd get a similar universe as our own, is zero. In the wide range of possibilities, there is an infinitessimal chance that we're going to happen to stumble on this magical combination of constants that makes particles possible, suns and planets and galaxies, and finally, the elements of life.

The second argument is best summarized by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. It states that over time, the universe will lose ""usable"" energy, until the very molecules and atoms themselves break down into a grey soup where energy is perfectly distributed throughout the universe. Assuming a finite universe that had a beginning and no end (which is basically the Big Bang), then what are the chances that we happen to exist near the beginning where there is still plenty of usable energy available? Again, infinitessimally small. The fact that the universe is the way it is says that either something beyond physics is ""recharging"" the universe (which would be God), or we just happen to have lucked out and we exist near the beginning.

So, both of these arguments basically say ""Either God exists, or we are just really, really, REALLY lucky.""

Let's take on the anthropic principle.

Let's say I have a theory that it is highly unlikely I will ever win the lottery. I go buy a ticket, and guess what! I won! Now, in order to continue my experiments, I buy another ticket, and another. Every ticket I buy, I am the winner! How many tickets would I need to buy and win before I change my theory to, ""I'm always a winner""?

The problem with the anthropic principle is this: You will NEVER change your theory, no matter what, because no matter how unlikely it is to keep winning the lottery, you're going to accept it as true because, well, here we are!

The idiocy of the anthropic principle can be explained in numerous ways but I like to summarize it like this. When you perform and experiment, and you get a result, you go with the theory that says that the result was most likely. As you perform more experiments, you get more results, and you stick with the theories that say those results are most likely. Eventually, you reach a threshold where the theories that predict that the results are unlikely are abandoned. This is what we did when we discovered the Higgs.

Well, unfortunately, we only have 1 universe we can observe. So we have to stick with the theories that say that this universe is most likely. That means all those theories that say the universal constants are set by chance, or that we just happen to exist where there is still usable energy left, are bogus and must be disqualified. If we had another universe to look at, we can see what we see and revisit this, but for now, the best explanation is that our universe was created by an intelligent being who intended for it to be this way, likely a being who can reverse entropy and thus possesses infinite power and such.

That's why physics says that all those theories that try to explain away God are wrong.",1,1505753211,2017-09-18 12:46:51

304,"The first one says that by rejecting gradualism, we would already possess the transitional forms:

&gt;Instead, I envisage a potential saltational origin for the essential features of key adaptations. Why may we not imagine that gill arch bones of an ancestral agnathan moved forward in one step to surround the mouth and form proto-jaws? Such a change would scarcely establish the Bauplan of the gnathostomes. So much more must be altered in the reconstruction of agnathan design -- the building of a true shoulder girdle with bony, paired appendages, to say the least. *But the discontinuous origin of a proto-jaw might set up new regimes of development and selection that would quickly lead to other, coordinated modifications*.

We have both sides of the jawed fish -- so if it evolved as rapidly as Gould believes, then there is no substantial transitional form between them.

However, we do have transitional forms for other organisms, [such as snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupodophis). Gould is arguing that not all characteristics will have arisen from gradualism and thus won't show transitional fossils.

For the second:

&gt;Species that were once thought to have turned into others have been found to overlap in time with these alleged descendants.

There are fossils and they still appear to be related. That they occur in the same layers suggests, once again, that a speciation event occurred and the new species forces out the old one as they share the same niche, but one is outcompeted.

306,"Full quote for Gould:

&gt;"" 2. The saltational initiation of major transitions: The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary states between major transitions in organic design, indeed our inability, even in our imagination, to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution. St. George Mivart (1871), Darwin's most cogent critic, referred to it as the dilemma of ""the incipient stages of useful structures"" -- of what possible benefit to a reptile is two percent of a wing? The dilemma has two potential solutions. The first, preferred by Darwinians because it preserves both gradualism and adaptation, is the principle of preadaptation: the intermediate stages functioned in another way but were, by good fortune in retrospect, pre-adapted to a new role they could play only after greater elaboration. Thus, if feathers first functioned ""for"" insulation and later ""for"" the trapping of insect prey (Ostrom 1979) a proto-wing might be built without any reference to flight.

&gt;I do not doubt the supreme importance of preadaptation, but the other alternative, treated with caution, reluctance, disdain or even fear by the modern synthesis, now deserves a rehearing in the light of renewed interest in development: perhaps, in many cases, the intermediates never existed. I do not refer to the saltational origin of entire new designs, complete in all their complex and integrated features -- a fantasy that would be truly anti-Darwinian in denying any creativity to selection and relegating it to the role of eliminating new models. Instead, I envisage a potential saltational origin for the essential features of key adaptations. Why may we not imagine that gill arch bones of an ancestral agnathan moved forward in one step to surround the mouth and form proto-jaws? Such a change would scarcely establish the Bauplan of the gnathostomes. So much more must be altered in the reconstruction of agnathan design -- the building of a true shoulder girdle with bony, paired appendages, to say the least. But the discontinuous origin of a proto-jaw might set up new regimes of development and selection that would quickly lead to other, coordinated modifications.""

Full quote for Stanley:

&gt;Superb fossil data have recently been gathered from deposits of early Cenozoic Age in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. These deposits represent the first part of the Eocene Epoch, a critical interval when many types of modern mammals came into being. The Bighorn Basin, in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, received large volumes of sediment from the Rockies when they were being uplifted, early in the Age of Mammals. In its remarkable degree of completeness, the fossil record here for the Early Eocene is unmatched by contemporary deposits exposed elsewhere in the world. The deposits of the Bighorn Basin provide a nearly continuous local depositional record for this interval, which lasted some five million years. It used to be assumed that certain populations of the basin could be linked together in such a way as to illustrate continuous evolution. Careful collecting has now shown otherwise. Species that were once thought to have turned into others have been found to overlap in time with these alleged descendants. In fact, the fossil record does not convincingly document a single transition from one species to another. Furthermore, species lasted for astoundingly long periods of time. David M. Schankler has recently gathered data for about eighty mammal species that are known from more than two stratigraphic levels in the Bighorn Basin. Very few of these species existed for less than half a million years, and their average duration was greater than a million years.

Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?” 

The missing links are …. missing. There are assumptions that some fossils represent a branch derivative of an assumed common ancestor, but assumptions don’t qualify as validation.

So, it’s just a falsified theory, nothing else. If folks want to believe it, not much one can do about that. By law, it has to be taught in school as an absolute truth, so a lot of folks believe it.

Show me one. In particular areas there are agreed upon rules for determining rank. For beetles there might be one set of criteria for when to call it a new family, for birds another. Paleontology has a different set of rules entirely. Species represent something real in the world, the other ranks are just some place further up the tree.

Now you can how I am wrong. Tell me some universal thing that makes a family or genera.

&gt;There are good reasons why things are categorized.

Absolutely. I didn't say there were not. Let me explain this again. I have 1,000 organisms. I can divide them into 10 species based on real objective criteria. Species means something (for mammals it means fertility, for other organisms there are different criteria). So I  have species A through J. Is A the same family as B? As C? We know they are different, the question is when are they different enough to apply a new ranking. And is family 1 the same genera as family 2?

The appendix serves an important role in the fetus and in young adults as well. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development. These endocrine cells of the fetal appendix have been shown to produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.(https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-function-of-the-human-appendix-did-it-once-have-a-purpose-that-has-since-been-lost/)

Well yes it has to include the word. You are claiming that a specific fossil is a fabrication, a fraud, and to support that idea you cite something that doesn't even discuss the fossil in question. Why does that need to be explained to you?

I'm going to try and explain this as simply as I can since you seemed to have missunderstood it the first time.

- You claimed that quote was from ""the guy who discovered the stone quarry where the archaetopryx"" Which is unequivocally false.

- We know this is false because the quote you provided references events that occurred ~120 years after the first fossil was found. Unless you're invoking time travel the person who made that quote wasn't around in 1860's

- The quote, and the entirety of the paper, isn't referencing Archaeopteryx thus has zero relevance to the claim you are making.

The nebraska man actual fossil itself was not entered into court but it was definetly drawn upon by the defense.

&gt;And thirdly, the Scopes trial didn't make it legal to teach evolution, in fact the defense lost the case.

No it did. The defense did not lose the case. They had to pay a certain amount of money because the teacher violated the law but then teaching evolution was legal after. (http://www.historynet.com/scopes-trial.htm) (http://evolutionfacts.com/Ev-V3/3evlch30.htm)

It was even called the Scopes **monkey** trial because it was the first time that evolution vs creation in classrooms was brought to courts.

We have no non-hoax fossils of Neanderthals.


&gt;I assure you I read the link. And I'll point out, again, that while the Peking man fossil has gone missing, we have 1000's of other examples of Homo erectus to compare it to.
Which would mean if the Peking man fossil was a fraud, it would have had to have been committed by a time-traveler since that's the only way they could have made a fake which would match exactly the fossils we would eventually find.

Or it could be have just been constructed to fit exactly what scientists would predict about a missing link assuming evolution is true. So scientists would say, ok we are looking for a missing link between X and Y and then they would make up its characteristics then they can just manufacture Peking Man to cater to these predictions. And no it did not simply go missing once scientists figured out that it was a hoax. If Peking Man is a hoax to cover up the lack of evidence, why should I accept your other ""discoveries""?

364,"&gt; Furthermore, shouldn't a technologically superior race be able to fly above the flood waters? Modern humanity would likely have more than 8 survivors due to a global flood

That's because Bible said that all the fountains of the great deep were broken and there were also rain for 40 days and nights. In the other words, the Earth got flooded from two water sources, in the underground and in the air. The flood level were above even highest mountain. Plus, the flood remained for 150 days. All technology were destroyed in the flood so we absolutely have no idea on what technology they have invented. Yes, there were really just 8 survivors. The Ark is huge (see Ark Encounter, they have built one that is similar in the size), and it was open for all people to enter. God had Noah to tell everyone that it was only way to survive the coming flood. Many people ignored that and carried on with their lives.  That is the picture of Jesus Christ today. He is our only way to be saved from our sins. Many people are ignoring that and carrying on with their lives.

Deceit is not blatant. A conman does not call your phone and tell you he is lying. He offers you a wonderful vacation cruise if you just put your faith in him. 

It was not a good thing that Rome conquered and controlled Christianity. There are many examples of things that were twisted, interpretations presented that are counter to Yeshua's message. 

For example:  Mark 13:32 tells us that Jesus doesn't know when the end time will come. For Jesus not to know something means that Jesus isn't omniscient. For Jesus not to be omniscient means that Jesus isn't God. Rome twisted Christianity into Pagan deity worship. 

Interestingly enough, Revelation warns us this will happen. Says 666 is the number of the Beast. The roman numeral system: 500-100-50-10-5-1. Rome is the beast. Revelation says the Beast will place a mark on people's forehead and that they won't be able to be part of society if they refuse to accept the mark. Ash Wednesday. During Roman Christian rule, if you didn't get a roman instrument of murder placed on your forehead you were slaughtered. The crucifix is the mark of the beast. [Revelation even warns us that the false image of a resurrected man would be used in the worship of the beast.](http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm)

Yes of course.  I just meant that if a comparison algorithm only counts nucleotide differences, then 25% similarity is the ballpark minimum we should ever see.  Not taking GC biases or codon biases into account.  This is why I was interested in conserved sequences, since they are above this randomness threshold.

&gt; Which doesn't mean 3-10% of DNA is conserved in mammals.

On my first reference they call it conserved in the caption:  ""Our highest estimate of conserved sequence in mammals is between mouse and rat, for which we estimate 189.0–258.4 Mb of functional sequence.""  But yes, this is the amount conserved between specific clades, not conserved across all mammals.  And yes, for the 3-10% I should've said conserved between various clades, not among all mammals.

&gt; purifying selection. Which doesn't mean 5% of DNA is conserved across mammals.

I assumed they were using constraint as a means of measuring purifying selection.  This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3207357/) is more recent and they measure ""mammalian constraint, using 29 eutherian (placental) genomes. We identify 4.2% of the genome as constrained.""  This sounds like all mammals share about 4.2% of their DNA.  Help me figure out if I'm misreading anything?

&gt; Humans share up to 75-95% DNA with other mammals.

I often see numbers like this quoted for how many protein coding genes we share with other mammals, and human-chimp DNA is probably around 95% similar, but do you have a source showing that there's another mammal family or order that we share 75% of our DNA with?

393,"Sorry I didn't go into more detail.  As you know, if we compare nucleotide-by-nucleotide than any random sequence will be 25% similar, because there are only four bases.  So I am measuring similar DNA by looking at conserved sequences among mammals, which is around 3-10%.  See [this figure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945182/figure/F2/), where the various clades share between 3% and 10%.  Likewise this source says [about 5% of DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577864/) is conserved across all mammals. 

From there I calculate it as follows:

1.  ENCODE found that about 20% of DNA participates in protein binding or exons.  Not all DNA within those regions is specific, and not all DNA outside of it is non-functional, so 20% seems like a good estimate.  Although I think the number is probably higher.
1.  20% - 5% conserved is 15% of functional DNA in each mammal that would have had to evolve since the mammal last common ancestor (LCA).
4.  We could assume that 5% evolves before the divergence of each mammal order, another 5% before each family, and another 5% before each genus.
2.  5% of mammal DNA is 150 million nucleotides.
6.  There are 26 orders, a something like a hundred families, and a thousand genera of mammals.
7.  26 * 150 million + 100 * 150 million + 1000 * 150 million is 170 billion nucleotides of functional DNA that would need to evolve since the mammal LCA.

Perhaps you could argue that perhaps the mammal LCA genome was very functional, and that since then different lineages lost different functions, but that just pushes the functional evolution back before the mammal LCA.  So I think this is a reasonable estimate no matter when you put the evolution.  If you have better numbers or a better way of estimating, it would be useful to go through it.",1,1505486856,2017-09-15 10:47:36

396,"While there's like 10-12 articles, I read 2-3 of them. One article would refer to Bible verses to show how intelligent we were back then. Another article refers to actual evidence to show how they were not brutes back then. 

&gt; To be upfront, I believe ancient humans were very nearly as intelligent as modern humans because 6000 years isn't very much evolutionary time. 

Exactly, if we are to adopt the evolutionary viewpoint, we require time period to be much longer than 6000 years. However, if this part get challenged and turns out that our earth is much younger than we thought it would be, then it become difficult to maintain the evolutionary viewpoint.  

&gt; But I also believe modern humans know much more about the world and have much better technology than ancient ones.

Like I said, I adopt the biblical viewpoint, God created Adam and Eve. The creation was very good. Once they sinned for the first time, the whole creation get cursed.  Each generation get a little less intelligent. This would go on for the years. It get to the point where we do not have as much knowledge and wisdom that our ancestors did back then. We become more dependent on technology and so on to compensate for this. That is in order to deal with various problems around in our world such as diseases, disabilities, wars, and so on. 

Sisters and brothers could marry each other and had children within first 10-20 generations after Adam and Eve.  However, Moses's time (around 2000-2500 years after the creation), this is no longer permitted because over in the time, gene in sisters and brothers would be too similar to each other. Israelites were way ahead of everyone else in the world. Many people, especially royal families, continued with this practice and this problem started to happen more often as time went. That led this practice to be outlawed just few centuries ago. That is one of actual evidence we can see that is an actual argument for this biblical viewpoint and the fact that our Earth is really young.

Living creatures are adaptable to their environment. As we haven't seen drastic changes to the environment within our history (yet,) we likewise haven't seen drastic changes within the species.

I have the same standard of evidence for both creation and evolution.  I can't show you God creating organisms any more than you can show me an ape evolving into a human.  But we can look at organisms and see which explanation is most consistent with the data we have.

We don't have a way to measure the capabilities of God, but evolution is measurable and all the data we have shows us it's not up to the task.  I think we've probably talked before about measuring rates of functional evolution using microbes, and about how all realistic population genetics simulations show fitness declining in complex organisms, as harmful mutations arise faster than selection can remove them?

From my link. 

Condensing Nebula: Condensing a gas cloud, like the Eagle Nebula, would increase pressure and temperature, which would then expand the cloud, because the weak force of gravity is easily overpowered by the cloud's pressure, as well as its angular momentum. Further, the cloud would have to be more massive than an average star yet orders of magnitude smaller than any known nebulae.
Magnetic Strength: The journal Science published what amounts to a parallel of the angular momentum problem,  ""Interstellar clouds are permeated by magnetic fields that we believe to be effectively frozen to the contracting gas; as the gas cloud collapses to form a star, the magnetic field lines should be compressed ever closer together, giving rise to enormous magnetic fields, long before the collapse is completed. These fields would resist further collapse, preventing the formation of the expected star; yet we observe no evidence of strong fields, and the stars [allegedly] do form, apparently unaware of our theoretical difficulties.""",-1,1505436341,2017-09-14 20:45:41

453,"&gt; I came across a few articles recently – one from Time magazine, How to Fix American Stupidity, and the other from The Atlantic, How America Lost Its Mind. Both articles provide a pretty healthy dis against people of faith. 

The book ""Total Truth"" by a Christian (Nancy Pearsey) spells out step by step how the evangelical church in the US turned its back on intellectuals and actually thinking about things deeply (aside from theology). It's a very interesting book and it also discusses evolution.

&gt; many other Christians) refuse to accept the evidence for evolution in part because of the social costs of doing so. Accepting the evidence means being removed from the community and losing one’s social structure.

Not so. Most of my Christian community embraces evolution. It's not ""evidence"" that I am not accepting. I used to believe in evolution until I started studying genetics. Then none of it made any sense. The handwaving stories are nice, but there is nothing behind the curtain.

&gt; I’d suggest that holding onto irrational beliefs (e.g., not accepting natural selection) 

Natural selection is not the same as evolution, and most of us here have no problem at all with it. FYI the problems are that proteins can evolve, that mutations can be beneficial and eventually create new phyla and families.

I bet I think think that some of your beliefs are irrational. I'm sure that you still believe them for various emotional reasons though. Who's to tell which beliefs are irrational and which aren't. Evolution seems like a pretty irrational belief for me (for those who have actually spent time studying the science, the rest are just going with the flow).

&gt; Does anyone else ever have these feelings? Would you ever be relieved if you were “allowed” to accept the evidence for evolution? If accepting the facts didn’t jeopardize your relationships with everyone you hold dear in your life?

Hahaha. No. Of course not. I wouldn't be relieved at all. I try not to bring up creation with others in my church because I don't want to get into an argument with them.

I guess that doesn't really apply to me personally. If I were to reject Christianity then I would lose most of my social circles, but even then I would still reject evolutionary theory because I think most of the scientific evidence is against it. These are some of the points I find compelling:

1. All of our observations show that functional nucleotide evolution is far too slow to account for the amount of functional DNA in complex organisms.
1. All realistic population genetics simulations show fitness declining as harmful mutations arrive faster than selection can remove them. What selection cannot maintain it could not have created.
1. The same genes are found in very unrelated organisms but not in their close relatives, and there is no clear-cut genetic tree of life. This pattern better fits the distribution of functional elements in things that we design.
1. The fossil record is characterized by sudden appearances and then layers of stasis. Gaps increase as the linnean hierarchy is ascended. Just like with designed things, were we have many similar phones or cars, but you have a lot of gaps if you try to find something that's the common ancestor of phones and cars.

As a reminder, I brought this up because you agreed that beyond-the-standard-model models shouldn't be taught in schools. It seemed contradictory to previous creationist ideas.

&gt;At some point though, one has to give up on some model

Like the YEC model? :P

The article you posted says nothing about the need to give up on models. It talks about the need for experimentalists to use methods that are useful to a wide variety of theoretical models. We are in the historically unusual predicament of having too many models and not enough tests. As such, our tests need to provide model-independent data that can provide evidence or counter-evidence for the widest variety of models.

We shouldn't give up on models until the data tells us to. Instead, we should acquire data to optimally test our many models.

&gt; string theory might be like this

String theory has led to advancements in other fields like [nuclear and condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Applications_to_nuclear_physics) and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Connections_to_mathematics). Even if the universe isn't made of strings, the process of thinking about the universe in a different way has led to novel mathematical insights.

&gt; new models are great. Why wouldn't anyone want them? I don't know what you're referring to.

Ultimately, there are many physicists wasting their time on dead end models, but we need many creative ideas to search for new physics which may not be intuitive. We should encourage creativity here, instead of taking hard-line stances against fudge factors and hypothetical particles, like the commenter you agreed with.

There seems to be a general dislike of any ""theoretical"" physics around here. Things like dark matter, dark energy, and the Big Bang are dismissed as fudge factors. I should point out there isn't anything scientifically wrong with fudge factors, AND these are *empirically supported* fudge factors.",1,1501196997,2017-07-27 19:09:57
4,"&gt; No, but it is certainly beyond the standard model. 

Okay, you're still being confusing. By standard model, you mean the standard model of particle physics where there are 6 quarks and 6 leptons in 3 families with boson force carrier particles. Correct? So can you please explain how creationism is beyond-the-standard-model? As far as I can tell, beyond-the-standard-model always refers to more particles or different configuration of particles. Like WIMPs, MACHOs, axinos, gravitinos, ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hypothetical_elementary_particles

I don't think that unproven theories/models like MOND are beyond-the-standard-model because it's a modification of general relativity and possibly other mechanics, not subatomic physics. 

However, at some point the standard model might interact with cosmology to explain things like why there is more matter than anti-matter.

&gt; Are you against beyond-the-standard-model models or not?

This question doesn't really make sense. Are you against charged black holes or not? White holes? Are you against all of the models that go beyond the classic Big Bang model? You would have to specify a particular model for me to answer this. And then to be against it -- well, it depends on the evidence. It's as crazy as saying ""I'm against Ohm's law but for Ampere's laws"". Or, maybe you're asking if I am interested in speculative new models. I'm not a theoretical physicist so I normally don't have particular interest in completely hypothetical models that have no grounding in experiment. They just don't interest me until they can begin to explain some discrepant events or simplify some complicated system down into a simpler one (eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_(physics) has been simplified by the postulate of quarks).

I'm mainly trying to be clear. I'm also quite skeptical so I tend not to believe things unless they are proven. So I generally dismiss speculation or hold it loosely until it has been corroborated repeatedly (think Pons and Fleischmann, the ""bacterial remnants"" in the Antarctic meteorite ""from Mars"").

&gt; I'm also not sure why there's so much negativity around physicists using new models. We need to develop new models to test in order to find the right one. That's the whole point of theoretical science.

Hey, new models are great. Why wouldn't anyone want them? I don't know what you're referring to. At some point though, one has to give up on some model, or relegate it to the back burner,  if it still doesn't work after decades of research.  So, string theory might be like this. I really want Garret Lisi's ~~SU8~~ E8 (oops) model of particle physics to work, but somehow other physicists have found problems with it (and it's all beyond my understanding, but his video is awesome).

12,"# Here's a summary

Information can be abstract, not physical.  Pythagoras' theorem does not have to be written down anywhere or even ever though of to actually exist.

QM: results of experiment must be detected and information recorded somewhere -- this changes the results.

To record something the recorder has to be able to be ""modeled as a tensor factor in Hilbert space"". Could God be like this? yes. Since human observation can destroy interference patterns, I assume that our brain is modeled like this too.

&gt;  it’s obvious and unexceptionable that, by observing a physical system, you can often learn something about what information must be in it.  For example, you need never have heard of DNA to deduce that chickens must somehow contain information about making more chickens. 

&gt; What’s much more surprising is that, in quantum mechanics, you can often deduce things about what information can’t be present, anywhere in the physical world—because if such information existed, even a billion light-years away, it would necessarily have a physical effect that you don’t see.

... Information takes up a minimum amount of space ... Is this why the universe has to be so big? Putting too much data on a hard drive would collapse it into a black hole! !!!

Matter takes up space. Energy?

Information must necessarily vary in space (when expressed linearly). Thus it also varies in time -- ie it varies in spacetime.  Anything that varies in time carries energy. 

If we know how quickly a field varies in spacetime we can find the minimum amount of energy that it must contain. 

In GR anything that carries energy couples to the gravitational field ... so too much information makes a black hole.

If God added more information somehow using some new physics, it would have to be invisible and undetectable to us.

Information is connected to tangible quantities such as pressure, temperature, and energy (and probably entropy):

&gt; But now, because the microscopic laws of physics have the **fundamental property of reversibility** —that is, they never destroy information—a new bit has to go somewhere, and it can’t overwrite degrees of freedom that are already fully randomized.  This is why, if you pump more bits of information into a tub of hot water, while keeping it at the same volume, the new bits have nowhere to go except into pushing up the energy.

All else being equal we should expect microbes to be much faster per generation at sequence evolution.  As it stands we have about a billion fold-difference between the rates at which we see microbes evolving, vs the rate at which animals would need to evolve in the past to account for the amount of unique functional nucleotides we find in animal genomes.

http://www.pnas.org/content/108/38/15721.full :

Unlike the original article, which was written specifically to discredit YES, this is more objective and  provides some more perspective:

&gt; Recently, a **very striking crystal growth problem** in earth sciences has emerged: the existence of giant crystals of gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), in particular those found in the range of Naica, Mexico (12, 13). [...] These geological scenarios are very singular due to the size (up to 11-m long and 1-m thick), euhedral shape and high transparency of these gypsum crystals. Besides their overwhelming beauty, the giant crystals of Naica **are also a challenging scientific problem for crystal growers, mineralogists, and geologists** because the processes accounting for the formation of these crystals must be the result of very specific crystallization conditions. 

This article has detailed information that could explain the issues I raised in my post above. But I have to get to work now ... maybe someone else can look into this.",3,1501077270,2017-07-26 09:54:30
39,"&gt; that these crystals have grown in a nearly uniform environments of about 58 degrees Celsius during their entire formation.  Laboratory experiments have allowed direct measurements of crystal growth rates at temperatures and concentrations of minerals in the water today.  That growth rate has been measured at 42 mm per thousand years at 58 degrees Celsius.
So, based on today’s conditions these crystals would have required 10s and hundreds of thousands of years to form,

This is really hard for anyone to explain. How can you have a constant temperature and constant chemical conditions for a hundred thousand years? The other problem is that as material crystallizes, the remaining solution must necessarily change its composition. So how can it have uniform composition? The article needs to explain that too.

Slower growth rates do make bigger crystals. I've made a 1"" copper sulphate crystal in a couple of weeks, say a month. (Alum is harder to control when growing crystals.)  So, to get a 90ft crystal would take 1 month * 1080 inches = 1080 months = 90 years. Hmm... not hundreds of thousands.

Calcium sulphate is really not very soluble in water at all and the maximum solubility is between [30-40C](https://www.google.ca/search?q=solubility+curve+of+calcium+sulphate&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=1625&amp;bih=822). It does not seem to be soluble in HCl either. So what solution exactly would have been in that cave??? I would love to know the exact composition and pH. **When something is insoluble, it precipitates out VERY RAPIDLY.**  Again, the article needs to give us the data to explain why this is not happening. 

Calcium sulphate scale is a [huge problem in industry](https://www.google.com/patents/WO1993008131A1?cl=en) as it cakes up the pipes and is hard to remove. It precipitates out quite easily.

So there is a lot that needs explaining in this article before it can be seen as a counter-example to YEC. The long time needed to grow these crystals just doesn't make sense. I'd also like to know how the composition of the crystals change from the base to the tip, and have examination of any inclusions, flaws, etc. that happen when a crystal is growing - just to see what these things could tell us.

It's also important to note that plagues do not benefit when they evolve to kill people, this is actually extremely detrimental to them.  Instead, microbial diseases that result in plagues that wipe out people in mass require the following conditions.  

1. They start in livestock or other animals frequently around people, where they do not kill the host.  They infect humans later, in a lethal form.  

2. They require dense populations of people together, otherwise they kill their hosts too quickly and effectively quarantine themselves.  

Thus, diseases that kill their hosts are actually doomed to fail, so that only diseases that large populations are immune to or that have no detrimental effects on the host are prone to survive over long time scales.  

Disease matches what evolution expects.  Rapidly mutating microbes turn into plagues, as they have multiple times in history, but typically lose steam as people either die or gain an immunity.

[They are **thought to** form by a self-feeding mechanism driven by solution-mediated anhydrite-gypsum phase transition, and therefore they must be the result of an extremely slow crystallization process close to equilibrium.](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/38/15721.short)

So, **the assumption “extremely slow crystallization process” is based on “thought to.”**

&gt; Laboratory experiments have allowed direct measurements of crystal growth rates at temperatures and concentrations of minerals in the water today.  That growth rate has been measured at 42 mm per thousand years at 58 degrees Celsius.

In the real world, at the Naica Caves, new crystals were growing in one of the caves at an accelerating rate that **started after the mining operations** started. [Finally the development of skeleton crystals instead of euhedral ones is an indirect proof that the **speed of growth by far exceeded** the rather modest supply of material by capillarity.](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1187&amp;context=ijs)

&gt; So, based on today’s conditions these crystals would have required 10s and hundreds of thousands of years to form, but could they have formed more quickly in the past under different conditions?

His reference paper puts it this way; [“They are thought.”](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/38/15721.short)

&gt; Theoretically, yes, however, close examination of the crystals reveals they were not formed more quickly in the past.

New crystals were growing, in one of the caves, that started after the beginning of the mining operation.

&gt; Why? Because if conditions – such as temperatures and dissolved mineral concentrations – had been much different in the past, then the crystals themselves would have recorded those changes in their crystalline structure as they formed.

I’ve got news for you, Bro. **They found pockets of water in the crystals. Some containing pollen, and some containing live bacteria.**

&gt; multiple radiometric methods

Based on an unfalsifiable dating theory.  Popper; “what is unfalsifiable is **classified as unscientific**.”

&gt; Think of it like tree rings

I have trouble thinking of it as tree rings when they **found baubles of water containing live bacteria**, in it.

&gt; In addition to using growth rates and high-resolution microscopy techniques to estimate the age

That’s pure BS. He shouldn’t have given the reference if he’s going to misquote it. The folks working on the “high-resolution microscopy techniques,” used the assumed age of the Naica crystals to test their technique, not to estimate the age. [**To test this technique**, we have selected the giant gypsum crystals of Naica ore mines in Chihuahua, Mexico.](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/38/15721.short)

&gt; In short, the very existence of these spectacular crystals is compelling proof

New crystals appearing in a short few years and reversing the text of the provided reference, is proof that the author doesn’t know what “proof” means, and perhaps struggling with the word “truth.”

&gt; The Naica crystals are just another in a long list of structures that cannot reasonably be doubted as the product of an ancient earth.

None of the research was done in the conditions in which the crystals were formed, because **it was all under water before the mining started.**

58,"&gt;Darwin knew in his heart that evolution by natural selection happened, but he didn't know how. In fact, he proposed a mechanism of heredity that proved to be dead wrong, something he called pangenesis. Ironically, the actual mechanism of heredity—genetics—was revealed in Darwin's lifetime, though he never knew it. Working with pea plants, the Austrian priest Gregor Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of genetics in 1865. But Mendel's work was neglected until 1900, and it wasn't until the 1940s that scientists identified DNA as the genetic material (here, Francis Crick's first sketch of DNA's double helix structure). Today, the clear focus of the revolutions now under way in genetics, medicine, and other fields is on the genomes of living organisms.

I was indeed overzealous, he only predicted that there must have been a mechanism by which change occurred over generations.  Gotten from [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/pred-nf.html).",3,1501009566,2017-07-25 15:06:06

There are plenty of ancestors to modern creatures in the Cambrian. Mostly sea life.

63,"Thanks for posting this.  I hadn't seen this paper until now.

Last week or so I posted where Dan Graur and Larry Moran said that if there's more than 1 harmful mutation per generation, then that's faster than natural selection can remove harmful mutations, the population will go extinct, and evolution fails.  The authors of this study also [recognize that problem](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6337/539):

* ""Thus, the average human should carry at least seven de novo deleterious mutations. If natural selection acts on each mutation independently, the resulting mutation load and loss in average fitness are inconsistent with the existence of the human population""

I did say I think Moran and Graur are being too hard on evolution, because recombination can probably take the limit higher than 1 mutation.  The authors of this study propose that negative epistasis also helps.  This basically means that the harmful effects of two mutations is greater than their individual sums or multiples, and thus selection can more effectively remove them.   This is an old idea that traces back at least to James Crow in the 1990s.  Synergistic epistasis also makes sense biologically since the stability of a protein fold decreases exponentially with each additional mutation.  

So is synergistic epistasis powerful enough to prevent harmful mutation accumulation?  In 2011 the Mendel's Accountant team [simulated synergistic epistasis](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0013) interactions at a rate ""about 100 times the maximum values we consider to be biologically realistic"" and tried various models of selection.  At best they found ""the mean number of accumulated mutations after 2000 generations was about 0.7% smaller with this level of SE relative to no SE"" and at worst they saw fitness declining even faster, because the effects of the individual mutations together was lower than what it otherwise would be.  Fitness still declined even under truncation selection, which is akin to artificial breeding where you omnisciently know the effects of every mutation.

I also think there's a lot more than 7 (this study) to 10 (used in Mendel) harmful mutations per generation.  [Here](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna/) I estimate that at least 20% to 45% of DNA is sequence specific, which gives us around 20 to 45 harmful mutations each generation.

However, humans don't number in the trillions and don't double every generation, so we need better strategies: we have germ cells and a paired genome. If a mutation isn't compatible with germ cells, that cell don't survive to reproduction; if the mutation is negative, it can still be suppressed by a functioning version from the other parent.

In any case, if we selectively weed out a reasonable proportion of negative mutations, then we are left accumulating positive mutations that hopefully outweigh or outcompete negative ones.

&gt; I think that you might be overemphasising ""beyond the standard model"" as a problem. … So there might be reasons to consider going beyond the Standard Model, but we haven't had any success so far. What do you think?

**You must go beyond the standard model**, otherwise there’s no advancement.

One problem arises when beyond-the-standard-model models start to be accepted as valid science without confirmation. There was a recent debate on this;  [George Ellis and Joseph Silk, published a controversial piece called Scientific Method: Defend the Integrity of Physics. They criticized a newfound willingness among some scientists to explicitly set aside the need for experimental confirmation of today’s most ambitious cosmic theories, so long as those theories are sufficiently elegant and explanatory.](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/a-crisis-at-the-edge-of-physics.html)

Another problem is when beyond-the-standard-model models are being taught in school, as “science.” Science isn’t being taught; ignorance of science.

**But, you have heap big trouble** when you start hypothesizing “hypothetical Beyond Standard Model particles” to bridge the gap between observation, “data coming from LHC,” and the “very many theoretical models available for Beyond Standard Model physics.” In essence, you’re using “hypothetical Beyond Standard Model particles” to validate “theoretical models available for Beyond Standard Model physics.” The “hypothetical Beyond Standard Model particles” will agree with observation because they were designed to. Instead of using observation to improve the model, thus reaping the benefits of going beyond the standard model, you’re changing observation to agree with the theory; adding another level of fudge factors.

[If a theory successfully explains what we can detect but does so by positing entities that we can’t detect (like other universes or the hyperdimensional superstrings of string theory) then what is the status of these posited entities? Should we consider them as real as the verified particles of the standard model? How are scientific claims about them any different from any other untestable, but useful, explanations of reality?]( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/a-crisis-at-the-edge-of-physics.html)

&gt; The thing is that with other models, there were discrepant observations that led to a change in models.

That’s doing it the right way. The other way is to just add more fudge factors to change observation to agree with the model.

There are a lot of things resolved if dark matter is real and it is hard to explain them all without it, which is why astronomers generally think it is.

The Standard model is great. Where does it fall short and why would anyone want to go beyond it?  Well, 

1. have we found any new particles that don't fit? No. I assume that the higgs boson fits (and even then isn't it more of a field than a particle, and they didn't actually detect the particle just something that it would have produced or effected, correct?)
2. What reason to go beyond then?

  1. dark matter: the galaxies are rotating too fast for normal physics. So postulate dark matter. So far there is absolutely no evidence that it exists.
  2. Unifying gravity with the other 3 fundamental forces. There is absolutely no fundamental reason that they should be unified, just that physicists believe that they were once unified.

As far as I can tell, I am a biological machine. I have absolutely no idea why I think I'm conscious or why I think I can see, nor how any of the blackboxed processes in my mind work. They are however knowable: I don't breath by choice, my heart doesn't beat by choice, we understand these pathways better than others. There are parts of 'me' even at the neurological that can be described by pure material, that don't need a soul: the higher level components are simply much more complex than a sinus rhythm and this is where your god of the gaps begins.

However, when you cut a person open, you don't find a soul -- just a lot of meat and a grey lumpy thing.

138,"&gt; … DES Year 1 data will soon be publicly released; and there is a lot of anticipation as to whether the data will prove consistent with the current concordance model or no.

The author, Michela Massimi, doesn’t spill the beans. But, it’s obvious that the results aren’t favorable for dark energy. This sheds some light on the outcome; (2016) [a catalogue of 740 Type Ia supernovae, more than ten times the original sample size - the **researchers have found that the evidence for acceleration may be flimsier than previously thought**](https://phys.org/news/2016-10-universe-rateor.html)

&gt; DES uses four different probes … Supernova of type Ia, … Precise measurements of both quantities are crucial for establishing whether dark energy is indeed a **non-zero vacuum energy** responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe

This is just fairytale science fiction. Note that “Supernova of type Ia” is part of the survey, and that “non-zero vacuum energy” is one of the considerations. Is “non-zero vacuum energy” something that might be real, or is it something fantasized? A scientist studying this part of the survey, “Supernova of type Ia”, puts it this way; [“Indeed, **vacuum energy is something of which we have absolutely no understanding in fundamental theory**.”](https://phys.org/news/2016-10-universe-rateor.html)

&gt; or, whether instead Einstein’s general relativity needs be modified to account for the observed accelerated expansion

You can’t have Einstein’s general relativity without accepting Einstein’s special relativity. But, you don’t have to accept Einstein’s special relativity to have relativity. You could go with Lorentz' theory. If you go with Einstein’s special relativity, then you’re accepting the philosophy behind it; [“Even though this theory is **experimentally indistinguishable** from special relativity, Lorentz' theory is no longer used for reasons of **philosophical preference** and because of the development of general relativity.”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_speed_of_light) Einstein’s special relativity is just something he invented to change Lorentz' theory, using Hume’s philosophy to change Newton to agree with what he termed the Mach principle.

- invented: Einstein; “he looks upon the concepts and theories as **free inventions** of the human spirit **not logically derivable from what is empirically given**”

- change Lorentz' theory: Einstein: “The ether of the general theory of relativity is transmuted conceptually into the ether of Lorentz if we **substitute constants** for the functions of space which describe the former, **disregarding the causes** which condition its state.” That’s how Einstein invented his version of relativity, substituted functions with constants and did away with causation. Hume gave the philosophical license to do away with causation.

- agree with the Mach principle: [“if he follows Mach”](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html)

&gt; Philosophy of science has built an industry around confirmation theory.

[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Confirmation and Induction, 1. “problem of the justification of induction” “The reason is that any such inference beyond those objects of which we had experience needs to be justified—and, **according to Hume, this is not possible**.”](http://www.iep.utm.edu/conf-ind/)

Einstein said Hume was the biggest influence on special relativity. Einstein didn’t really invent it, he just used Hume’s philosophy to change Lorentz using constants and ignoring causation, which Hume says is impossible to justify. 

&gt; There are some surprising similarities in some of the methodological challenges that cosmologists and particle physicists face today in the light of the wealth of data coming out…

Both Einstein relativity, and thus the Big Bang, and Quantum Mechanics, are based on non-reality philosophies. So, they’re having trouble with “the wealth of data coming out.” In other words, they’re having problems with scientific observation.

&gt; Or, are there really particles whose physics goes **beyond the Standard Model**?

“Beyond the Standard Model” is a nice way of saying that it is contrary to the laws of physics.

&gt; Simplified models focus on a handful of parameters for hypothetical Beyond Standard Model particles (mass values, cross-sections, branching ratios) so as to provide an effective interface between the wealth of data coming from LHC and the very many theoretical models available for Beyond Standard Model physics.

Keep in mind, **“Beyond Standard Model,” means, contrary to the laws of physics.**

So, they’re building an “interface” to change scientific observation, “data coming from LHC,” using hypothetical-contrary-to-the-law-of-physics particles to support competing contrary-to-the-law-of-physics Models.

&gt;Any number of things might happen to me to alter my personality drastically, but there must still be a “me” to experience this alteration. I am, therefore, substantially distinct from these other things.

If I eliminate your memories entirely, there is no method to determine whether ""me"" is still there. Without the memories, there is nothing to suggest a continuous existence. There's little to suggest there's a ""me"" now beyond the memories and personality, given it can't be isolated.

&gt;Notice that even in your own words, you must speak of yourself as something distinct from matter as such.

The matter is part of the substrate. Without it, there's no indications I would continue to exist.

&gt;Brain damage results in losses corresponding to the areas damaged. Memory, personality, ability, each can be targeted by the sections of the brain mapped to contain them

then I addressed that with the concession that what happens to our bodies affects our minds.  Your demonstrating this, however, is not an argument against the existence of the mind.  

When I say mind (i.e., me), I mean that first person consciousness who is looking out these eyes and telling these fingers to type a response to you.  I do not mean my personality or even my memories.  I have to exist in order to do anything, including remember something.  Similarly, I have to exist before some evil genius can replace my real memories with false ones.  Any number of things might happen to me to alter my personality drastically, but there must still be a “me” to experience this alteration.  I am, therefore, substantially distinct from these other things.

&gt;the matter itself isn't the information that produces me, but the arrangement of it.

Notice that even in your own words, you must speak of yourself as something distinct from matter as such.  You are *produced* by the arrangement of the matter.  You, the being reading and considering these words did not exist at one point, and yet the matter did.  This is fundamentally different from something like a car, which although it may not have taken that form before is still simply matter (third person) arranged in a particular way.  Words on a page are simply matter.  The term ""information"" is only coherent in terms their being perceived by a consciousness.",0,1500917826,2017-07-24 13:37:06

This doesn't suggest that I'm not an emergent property of matter, only that the matter itself isn't the information that produces me, but the arrangement of it. I am still bound by this matter in this pattern, and a discontinuity means whatever pattern comes out might no longer be me.

So, damage my brain enough and there's nothing to suggest I still exist.

I’m saying Augustine recognized that dogmatically holding to specific interpretations in spite of evidence to the contrary (especially when they are primarily found in one country (aka the US)) can be damaging and so are Christians who tell those who have studied nature (which includes other Christians) that the evidence should be discarded just because of how they interpret the Bible.  Frankly, we don’t know what Augustine would think about the flood today since a lot more research has been done in the last 1600 years on the history of ANE (Ancient Near East) views / ANE communication styles.  I doubt he excluded himself from his own quotes.  I would hope he could recognize that he, like everyone else (myself included), may be wrong.

That’s very profound!  Yes!  We are all equally wrong if we are wrong about Christ.  Something I have noticed is that the YEC side of the debate tends to say non-YEC’s are either not true Christians or are compromised Christians and do not respect the Bible.

&gt;Which presupposition are you referring to?

How should scientists study the engine requirements for a plane that needs to go from NY to LA?  Will God change gravitational pull a year from now?  Will God stretch the continent significantly or suddenly split it apart between the engine design and construction making the distance farther than it currently is?  How far North or South with God move the plane while it is in flight?  What assumptions should be made when evaluating a plane’s engine requirements?  Why should the methodology change when looking at creation?


&gt;Many more leave the faith because they are taught that evolution is fact and they cannot reconcile this with their own understanding of the Bible. Many of the atheist Darwinians were raised in the church, and left for precisely this reason. That sword cuts both ways.



I agree??  Maybe I am misunderstanding what you are saying.  Atheist Darwinians have an unholy alliance with YEC’s…..either believe Genesis a certain way or toss the entire Bible.  This is a false dilemma.






&gt;Whenever the theological implications begin to be discussed, it will be claimed that I am saying anyone who disagrees with me is hell bound or disgracing God's word, so that the theological implications can be pushed to the side and ignored.  But the truth is, I am not saying those things at all.


When you say, “I don't find that defending what I believe is the sanctity of God's word is doing any damage to the faith”, you are implicitly saying that OEC’s/TE’s are attacking the sanctity of God’s word…..otherwise, why are you on defense?  It is not God’s word that is being attacked by other Christians; it is the human interpretation of a few chapters in Genesis that is the topic of discussion



&gt;It would call into question the very words and work of Christ himself.


Why?  Let’s assume that Genesis 1-11 is entirely allegorical stories (aka parables using archetypes) told to convey lessons about God….why does that call into question the words of Christ?  Many OEC’s and TE’s do not go that far, but if they did what changes?  It doesn’t change the fact that all men sin and need redemption or the historical evidence that Jesus rose from the dead.

This appears very much to be ""God of the Gaps"", the thought that if we can't explain it yet then it must be God. Note the *yet* in the previous sentence, the problem with God of the Gaps is that eventually something scientific will be found to fill in that gap, requiring God to take up residence in another gap until that too is filled. Each time God moves further and further away as we discover ways to explain the physical world and its function without God, it's happened countless times in the past and will continue to happen. The problem with ascribing things to God is that what happens in the future once we do discover a scientific explanation?

Appeal to ridicule fallacy :P

But to actually address what you're trying to say... You've stated that you believe that the study of the soul should belong to metaphysics, which is philosophy rather than science. Despite this however you still want emperical evidence from OP rather than deductive logic. Pointing this out isn't creating a strawman, this would require me creating an absurd argument which is easily defeated. I have not done this however, I've merely taken what you've said then pointed out the discrepancy.

So this leaves you with two choices:

1. Argue scientifically like you originally wanted from OP, this will require you to lay out as to why a Christian soul is required and why it exists, using evidence and reason to back up your claim.

2. Instead argue it philosophically, however this would appear (at least to me) that you've decided to change your approach after having your original scientific bluff called out.",1,1500785243,2017-07-23 00:47:23

Straw-man, I never said that was my view. But, that is the prevailing view, and it is what the author is up against if he wishes to present his philosophy as necessary to biology. The relationship between Natural Science and metaphysics is a highly debated subject.

I didn’t address “soul.” As I understand the article, it doesn’t address it either, but three properties of the soul.

&gt; what makes the description of a soul laid out in the OP any less valid than your idea of a Christian one?

In this article, the nature of soul isn’t addressed; but three properties of the soul. “I am,” “I have,” and “I want.” Limited strictly to the first sentence and those points alone; “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.”; there’s some agreement.

The article defines what it considers properties of the soul. The Bible quote doesn’t describe this as being properties of the soul, but what the soul is subject to in a carnal worldly existence.

Biology does study, “study of life,” but isn’t Ontology, “the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.”

A few months ago I spoke with one of AIG's biologists about Glenn Williamson.  This biologist told me that when Glenn submitted his original critique to ARJ, that AIG then requested his original data.  In one dataset Glenn's calculations showed 96% similarity, but in another of Glenn's datasets showed 87% similarity.  When ARJ asked Glenn to fix the discrepency between the two datasets, he deleted the data that showed 87% similarity, presumably without reason.  I have not asked Glenn Williamson about this.

Which presupposition are you referring to?  



&gt;You keep coming back to the OEC/TE just accepts what others tell them


&gt;&gt;I can't tell if you're being willfully ignorant of my point, or if you really don't understand. I did not say that ALL OECs and TEs just ""accept what others tell them""


You may not mean ALL, but you are speaking in a way that implicates the vast majority have an uneducated bias while there may be a small minority that do not.  For example, you said, “Multiple worldviews that **all** fall under the umbrella of the same presupposition.”  I’m not sure you would even bring this up (or even mention education/bias earlier) if you did not believe this was the vast majority.

I agree.  Do you recognize there is a difference between a Darwinist and a TE?



&gt;Ohhh, if this is ""the damage"" that all the OECs and TEs are referring to when they criticize YEC, then I am not upset at all! 


It is a simple fact that many leave the faith because they are given an ‘either you believe it the way I do or you have to toss out the Bible’ dilemma. This has been well documented in studies as one of the top reasons why young people leave Christianity.



&gt;I don't find that defending what I believe is the sanctity of God's word is doing any damage to the faith, and I imagine I will never feel that way. 


Why do you believe your interpretation is defending the sanctity of God’s word but someone who disagrees with your interpretation doesn’t believe in the sanctity of God’s word?  You may not be saying that exactly with your words, but the message you are sending is that those who disagree with you do not honor God's word.

&gt;they who contend that these things never happened, but are only figures setting forth other things, in the first place suppose that there could not be a flood so great that the water should rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, because it is said that clouds cannot rise above the top of Mount Olympus, because it reaches the sky where there is none of that thicker atmosphere in which winds, clouds, and rains have their origin.  They do not reflect that the densest element of all, earth, can exist there; or perhaps they deny that the top of the mountain is earth.  Why, then, do these measurers and weighers of the elements contend that earth can be raised to those aerial altitudes, and that water cannot, while they admit that water is lighter, and liker to ascend than earth?  What reason do they adduce why earth, the heavier and lower element, has for so many ages scaled to the tranquil ether, while water, the lighter, and more likely to ascend, is not suffered to do the same even for a brief space of time?

&gt;They say, too, that the area of that ark could not contain so many kinds of animals of both sexes, two of the unclean and seven of the clean.  But they seem to me to reckon only one area of 300 cubits long and 50 broad, and not to remember that there was another similar in the story above, and yet another as large in the story above that again; and that there was consequently an area of 900 cubits by 150.  And if we accept what Origen has with some appropriateness suggested, that Moses the man of God, being, as it is written, “learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,” who delighted in geometry, may have meant geometrical cubits, of which they say that one is equal to six of our cubits, then who does not see what a capacity these dimensions give to the ark?

Augustine was in favor of not saying dumb stuff so as to not make Christians look dumb.  A global flood that wiped out all air breathing life, except for the beings on the ark was not one of those things.

Augustine absolutely believed a global flood and taught a global flood and challenged the dissenters on this issue.",2,1500648961,2017-07-21 10:56:01

When you go to pick up your prize, make sure you point out that:

1.  The idea that ""The other parts of our genomes have different MRCAs"" assumes every allele (gene variant) has a common ancestor.  But if we assume creation this would likely not be the case.  If Adam and Eve were the first two humans then they would have likely had different alleles of many genes.

2.  ""it's very likely (as in, almost certain) that they were not alive at the same time."" -&gt; The 200,000 years date conventionally assigned to Mitochondrial Eve comes from a mitochondrial DNA mutation rate that was determined by comparing human and chimp mitochondrial DNA and assuming they shared a common ancestor ~6 million years ago.  The actual mitochondrial DNA mutation rate is much faster.

So both these arguments are built on the premise that humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor.  Therefore his argument reduces to:

1.  If humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor.
2.  Then creation is false.

I am not sure how a creation worldview can survive against this impeccable logic.

249,"&gt; there is a peer review process where the evidence can be examined by multiple people who have multiple world views.

Multiple worldviews that all fall under the umbrella of the same presupposition. So it still not a neutral starting point. There really is no such thing. The wider scientific community is just made up of a lot of people who happen to agree on which biased starting point they want to hold to.

&gt; You keep coming back to the OEC/TE just accepts what others tell them

I can't tell if you're being willfully ignorant of my point, or if you really don't understand. I did not say that ALL OECs and TEs just ""accept what others tell them"", I just made the point that, like some YECs, there are some, (again not ALL,) who do accept OEC and TE out of ignorance. So if you are going to say that the YECs who accept their view out of ignorance, (which is also some not ALL,) are harming the church, then you have to be equally critical those OECs and TEs, (which again is not ALL of them, but only some,) for accepting their views out of ignorance. But that never seems to be the case.

&gt; Because YEC scientists have the conclusion already determined before they have the evidence and frequently add wild speculations to get the conclusion they want.

Funny, I would say that this is precisely what Darwinians do. And I imagine you would disagree with me on that point and say they are completely neutral. I wonder if it is because we both have presuppositions. (See my first point.)

&gt; Perfect example of the damage YEC’s do.

Ohhh, if this is ""the damage"" that all the OECs and TEs are referring to when they criticize YEC, then I am not upset at all! I don't find that defending what I believe is the sanctity of God's word is doing any damage to the faith, and I imagine I will never feel that way. And the truth is, I already see the Genesis and OT narratives being tossed away, so I was not speaking hyperbolically, but rather from actual experience. An historical Adam and Eve and Fall are already on their last legs, along with Noah and the Tower of Babel account. I've seen Jonah being thrown into the metaphorical column, as well the Exodus account, and sometimes even Moses himself, being written out of history. Recently, I even saw a discussion of a group of people questioning if the accounts of David could even be considered real. So I don't think I am exaggerating when I say that the OT being cast out as metaphorical fiction or sensationalized myth is a real danger in the near future. Even Tim Keller, a fairly high profile TE admits that it is a real danger:

&gt; Many orthodox Christians who believe God used EBP (evolutionary biological processes) to bring about human life not only do not take Genesis 1 as history, but also deny that Genesis 2 is an account of real events. Adam and Eve, in their view, were not historical figures but an allegory or symbol of the human race.

&gt; If you hold to the view that Adam and Eve were not literal, and you realize the author of Genesis was probably trying to teach us that Adam and Eve were real people who sinned, and that Paul certainly was, then you have to face the implications for how you read Scripture. You may say, “Well, the Biblical authors were ‘men of their time’ and were wrong about something they were trying to teach readers.” The obvious question is, “how will we know which parts of the Bible to trust and which not?”

So even if you believe that the OT is real history, you have to at least understand the dangers in beginning to interpret historical narratives as allegorical, and how that could most certainly open the door for more reinterpretations.",1,1500584314,2017-07-20 16:58:34

Trivial, yet somehow unobtainable. You admit it's a system, using a code, but can't see the forest for the trees. Where did the code/codon language originate? Look at it another way. Is there a language that could be randomly generated without intelligence. Someone **must** determine *meaning* or its gibberish. Looking again to my ""random"" letter sentence, I would have to set rules for its use that you could discern and use to understand the otherwise apparently random data. 

&gt;The computer is simply the world it operates it in. We get chemistry, they get signals on silicon

Agreed on the world analogy, but signals are language. Random electrical values get you nothing. The same for random chemistry.


&gt;They correspond physically to an anti-codon tag on the amino acid

A tag that is created from the DNA  codon code. Circular reasoning, yes? If the amino acids determine the cordon requirement DNA uses, DNA had to be interpreted to create the amino acid, using an incredibly complex machine called a ribosome. Which itself had to be assembled from DNA/tRNA through a previous ribosome.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome?wprov=sfla1

&gt;The rules exist due to chemistry, an unintelligent, unknowing process. I still see no intelligences required.

 Chemistry has no language rules since it is, as you assert, unintelligent. Like your stream analogy, there's no information processing involved, no language rules. Chemistry has no language, and can't create one.

I think I understand your reasoning, but it's not tenable without somehow demonstrating language/coding rules from chemical, or at least otherwise unintelligent, activity.

So, once again, you determine it's possible (with Linux), but no examples. Until then, it's purely ungrounded supposition, and my statement stands, unassailed. Not possible.

As for rocks in a stream, that's no more part of an information system than my male pattern baldness. It may be data, but there's no possibility of internal/working interpretation. There's no replication, no processing, it can't regulate itself. No error correction, no code. No system, certainly no life. It doesn't even *mean* anything, like a language would. There's no symbolism, like language, standing in place for another concept. 

It will get up to 76 degrees today.

The 76 degrees, a data point, means nothing absent the surrounding text. It's a data point that means nothing. You even have a frame of reference that determines I must mean Fahrenheit, because Celsius would be way to hot for that to fit. And then, still not actually stated, you know this is about the (maximum) temperature it's predicted to be today despite degrees also being a measurement of angle. It's interpretable. 

And that's not even to the level of code. The ""coding"" is inside your brain, based upon a created language, allowing you to process the information, the information that contains and gives context to the data point.

Sweet! Thank you! You just helped me work out a three tier system. Data (or *raw* information), then context/language, then code/processing! The sum would constitute the information system. Sincerely, did not have that connection until just now.

And somewhere in there you had to create a syntax (rules) that allows the language and code to work together to process the data. So, what determines the rules/syntax? Who does the compiling? That's a creative process, pure and simple. Data doesn't make language, much less code, similarly to the nonsense sentence from my previous post.

Not only would your Linux program have to be generated randomly, but the computer's bios would have to be randomly generated first. No processing allowed without code.

Put some random numbers into a text file, rename the extension to .exe and go. Chances are it does nothing. The Windows environment is much like ours -- abiogenesis doesn't happen here, and randomly generated programs won't run. But on a Linux machine it gets a lot more possible.

&gt;That is the information of which I speak. 

Then you've gone beyond information theory. You keep adding intelligence, but information can be interpreted by a literal stream with rocks in it.

Perfect example of the damage YEC’s do.  This is a typical either/or scenario……either the YEC interpretation is correct, or Christianity is false.  So many YEC’s are taught this and then they see real evidence that YEC is wrong and their entire faith crumbles because that is all they have….faith.

There are so many problems with this, I have no idea where I should even begin. The ""four corners of the earth"" obviously refer to the four points of a compass, and has been used as such throughout pretty much all of history, probably even before that passage of Scripture was written. And then humans as literal sheep, I mean, this is so obviously written as an analogy, it is causing me physical pain write now that you equated that with Genesis 1, which most Hebraists would tell you is in the structure of historical narrative.

&gt; Imagine if a YEC person put forward a hypothesis that the universe was 6000 years old. Hes not stating the existance of a creator but people will take a hint.

This is exactly what YEC people do, and it absolutely implies the existence of a Creator, which is why it is rejected by the wider scientific community, unlike the Big Bang, which was eventually accepted.

&gt; If you cant prove Gods existance scientifically (in which case God is not supernatural in the classical sense)

Wait, what? You previously said science can make no supernatural claims, because science only deals with the natural world. And now you're saying that if science can't prove something, then it can't be supernatural?

Well, there are plenty of apologists who are much more qualified than me to give you all the evidence for God's existence. And I think that evidence weighs a little heavier than someone claiming that a ghost can cause autism.

Right, but this is my point.

Sure it does. It just doesn't produce the light it gives off. It can still be considered an immediate source of light, even if it is not the ultimate source.

The text doesn't specify. I would think that the land producing creatures indicates more that creatures are composed of the same elements as the ground, just as Adam was created ""from the dust of the earth."" The text does not say that the water created the creatures in it, just that it ""teemed"" with them.

Possibly, but I would argue that the timeline of one day greatly limits your options.

&gt;there are many green plants (e.g. hemlock) that are highly poisonous if ingested and have little nutritional value.

They are poisonous today. Species have changed drastically since Creation, so it is likely that there were no poisonous plants at Creation. Poison appears to be a consequence of the Fall and the Curse, just like thorns and thistles.",15,1500504310,2017-07-19 18:45:10

&gt;What is “real science” and how do you do it?


&gt;&gt;You tell me. 


Part of “real science” is investigating the evidence without (or regardless of) a preconceived conclusion.  Do YEC scientists do this?




&gt;Why do you say Christians hold these views just because they are told this by secular schools?



&gt;&gt;I did not come anywhere near saying that ALL Christians who hold those views do so simply for that reason, just as I wouldn't say all Christians who hold YEC views do so because they are ignorant of science, which many OECs and TEs like to do.



“You overlook the Christians that hold to OEC and TE, not because of their ""scientific brilliance"", but because their secular schooling told them it was fact”



That is essentially saying OEC’s and TE’s only believe what they are told in school.  It is also essentially saying that there is no evidence to support the OEC or TE view.  Of course some just believe what they are told in school….not everyone becomes a scientist.  Isn’t that the same with some YEC’s and believing whatever their church/parents/Christian school say?  



&gt;It is difficult me to see how a narrating of the Creation week in clear, non-metaphorical language fits this description, seems like a stretch. 



That doesn’t answer the question.  It is difficult for me to see how Genesis 1 can be interpreted literally based on the text alone, so we disagree.  One (or more) interpretation is wrong.  What if the YEC interpretation of Genesis 1 is wrong? Why is that impossible?  Why is the YEC view primarily found in the US and not other countries?




&gt;But what if the wider scientific community is wrong about uniformitarian naturalism? 



You need to define your terms.  Uniformitarianism is different than naturalism and naturalism is different than naturalistic methods of investigating nature.  Naturalism can be false even if uniformitarianism and the naturalistic method are correct.

Because they dont believe its true.

&gt;But this in no way makes any claims to a creator,



Explicity no. But to many it implied it. Imagine if a YEC person put forward a hypothesis that the universe was 6000 years old. Hes not stating the existance of a creator but people will take a hint.


&gt;But what would we use to prove God's existence?


Thats effectively not their problem. If you cant prove Gods existance scientifically (in which case God is not supernatural in the classical sense), then they dont have to be concerned with it. The responsibility for proof is on the person putting the idea forward. Otherwise nonpragmatic agnosticism is the best youll find.

Here is a list of superseded scientific theories, many of them outright falsified (like Spontaneous Generation): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories

But this in no way makes any claims to a creator, as is evident in the current studies on the Big Bang.

The future looks bright for someone who just believes their Bible, they don’t have anything to worry about. However, it helps to have a little understanding on the rules of science, which will show that the “stigma” comes from ignorance, not science.

[Definition of scientific method: principles and procedures for the systematic **pursuit of knowledge** involving the recognition and formulation of a problem, the collection of data through observation and experiment, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scientific method)

[scientific theory: a coherent group of propositions formulated to explain a group of facts or phenomena in the natural world and **repeatedly confirmed** through experiment or observation](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scientific-theory)

So, the hypothesis must be “confirmed” before it can be accepted as knowledge. Until it’s confirmed, you only have an assumption.

[assumption: a thing that is **accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof**.](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+assumption&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)

A hypothesis is an important tool in science, but to represent it as scientific knowledge is ignorance of the rules of science. 

There’s no scientific knowledge that conflicts with the Bible’s timeline. In fact, **scientific observation 100% falsifies evolution’s timeline, doesn’t conflict with the Bible.**

All galaxies, including the Milky Way, and clusters and superclusters are flying apart, they aren’t in sustained orbits. Thus, **the Milky Way can’t be billions of years old.** That’s 100% confirmed scientific observation based on our current laws of physics, starting around 1932. 

NASA: [… **fact** that the speed at which galaxies spin is **too fast to be held together** by the gravity of **all the stars that we can see**.](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/ask_astro/dark_matter.html){1}

So we have scientific observation, “repeatedly confirmed,” that “galaxies spin is too fast to be held together by the gravity of all the stars that we can see.” What to do?

- we can just accept that what we see is what we see (But that falsifies evolution.)

- we can try to convince folks that there are things, that are impossible according to the laws of physics, impossible to see, impossible to detect; that change everything we do see.

After 1980, the second option was agreed on. So, the fudge factor dark matter, impossible to see, detect, contrary to the laws of physics; is used to change orbital calculations on all galaxies, clusters and superclusters, to represent them as being in sustained orbits. A “fudge factor” is the term for a calculation adjustment that changes observation to agree with a hypothesis. If you look the term up on Wikipedia, you’ll see dark energy, dark matter and inflation, listed as examples. 

The Anthropic Principle was introduced shortly before dark matter was accepted as the answer to the missing mass problem. [How The Anthropic Principle Became The Most Abused Idea In Science: “It tells us that our Universe does exist with such properties that an intelligent observer could **possibly have evolved** within it.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/01/26/how-the-anthropic-principle-became-the-most-abused-idea-in-science/#32e965797d69) Under the Anthropic Principle, it’s considered OK to change scientific observation to agree with evolution.

So, evolution’s timeline is based on something that’s impossible to see, impossible to exist according to the laws of physics. But, **the Bible’s timeline is comfortable with 100% scientific “repeatedly confirmed” observation.**

So what is the difference between evolution and creationism/ID in the context of eye design? 

1. Evolution says eyes develop via a path dependent optimization algorithm. This will occasionally keep ""bad"" vestigial remnants, such as blind spots.
2. I think creationism/ID would say (correct me if I'm wrong) that the eye was intelligently designed, such that everything in the eye is placed optimally. This means there should be no ""bad"" structures, and no superior eye designs should be possible.

In light of these differences, it seems to me that you should be arguing that blind spots are good. Instead, you argue that they aren't bad. 

In other words, evolutionists would say that evolution has compensated for the leftover blind spot to make it a non-issue in most visual contexts, but a creationist needs to go beyond this, showing that the blind spot gives an advantage. To be a good design, the blind spot should be a feature.

And the Big Bang theory never made any claims to a supernatural work of a creator, so it was never going to receive the pushback that YEC will always receive until the wider community is willing to let go of pure naturalism. I also think you are overstating the pushback Lemaitre received. Scientific skepticism is not the same as the *a priori* denial of credibility that YEC receives.

And it is obvious in many quotes of many Darwinian evolutionists when they say things like ""we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door"" (R. Lewontin) or ""Science is fundamentally a game...with one overriding and defining rule: Rule #1: Let us see how far and to what extent we can explain the behavior of the physical and material universe in terms of purely physical and material causes, without invoking the supernatural,"" (R. Dickerson), and that evolution must be true ""because the only alternative, special creation, is clearly incredible [read: 'not credible']"", (D.M.S. Watson).

&gt;The problem with your post is twofold: 1) you presume creation science is not really science, that the biologists, geologists, physicists, cosmologists, paleontologists, etc., in creation science are not doing ""real science"". 


What is “real science” and how do you do it?  



&gt; You overlook the Christians that hold to OEC and TE, not because of their ""scientific brilliance"", but because their secular schooling told them it was fact


Why do you say Christians hold these views just because they are told this by secular schools?  








&gt;So the other lesson of Augustine is that people adding their own ideas and opinions to reinterpret Genesis 1 is not a novel concept.



Exactly, which is why he also said, “In matters that are so obscure and far beyond our vision, we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received.  In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search for truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it.”


What if the YEC interpretation of Genesis 1 is wrong?  Why is that impossible?
",1,1500480095,2017-07-19 12:01:35
339,"I couldn't put down anything coherent right now, but here's one of the points I've been considering. I'm just assuming that Moses did in fact write Genesis 1 despite the dispute that it may have been someone else due to style differences. But for our purpose it doesn't entirely matter, because we know that the audience is the ancient Israelites (or was this still prior to the formation of the nation of Israel? I forget). 

These were people who either came from other traditions, and were at least surrounded by other cultures and nations, that all had creation stories that involve god(s) creating the world, and some time later floods happen and there is destruction. 

Generally speaking, creation stories are important to people because they communicate information about how their world works so that they can understand their life. They use these stories to communicate the nature of God, the nature of Man, the nature of their environment, the nature of relationships, etc. it isn't particularly important for farmers to understand that the sun was created in the matter of a day or created before land was created. It does matter, however, that their god has full control over the sun, and therefore has full control of his source for food and warmth. It isn't really relevant that one of his gods is angry with the other wind god. But it does matter to him if the battle between the wind and sun god results in him having a longer winter if the wind god wins. Therefore he'll sacrifice to the sun God. 

I see Genesis 1-3 as Moses communicating to the Israelites not just vital points about God, man, work, the environment, sin, Satan, but communicating the Gospel itself with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit all at work in the world from the very beginning. The question is, what is the information that Moses cared about and  wanted to communicate? 

I don't think the Israelites would have understood this information as well if Moses had written about how large eyes developed in certain organisms to facilitate predation and defense, which drove the Cambrian explosion of life diversity. Who cares? We're Ancient Israeli farmers trying to make sure our kids survive the winter. I'm already familiar with all these stories passed down by oral tradition. How great and how loving this one true God is! See how different His world works than the worlds of these other Gods! See how he is working all things to crush the serpant's head! 

I guess my point, all this information stands as truth no matter what context you consider it in. This information can be communicated effectively to an uneducated Israeli farmer, and the same information can be communicated to someone who studied biology for a decade. Whether I'm this Israeli farmer or this biologist working in the centers of modern academia I can understand who my God is as the Creator and restorer of all things. 

And I don't think that's deceptive or untruthful at all. Because I don't think Moses or his audience cared about how long creation took or whether a chunk of the moon fell off and hit earth during creation. You could make Genesis into a 10,000 page evolution text book, which would make my life as a biologist easier, but wouldn't really help the Israelites understand God. To be clear, I'm not saying humans are better or more advanced now. I'm just saying that we have different resources by which to perceive the world. 

What do you think? Does a literal reading of Genesis lend itself to understanding God differently than the way I read it? Because my God is still Lord of the universe and breathed life into every living thing to produce a beautiful and perfect creation, all of which now groans as in the pain of child birth because of our sin. 

One final point -- if Christians are engaging in spiritual conversations with non-Christians and the subject of creation or Genesis comes up it shouldn't be our goal, whether YEC or not, to defend the Genesis narrative or convince them about Genesis. Our goal should be to share with them the Gospel, which includes God creating the world, but does not include whether that took 7 days or 7 billion years. It does include man being corrupted by sin, but it does not need to include a serpent or an apple. These are minor points that distract from the point of the Gospel, I think. What do you think? What are your conversations like with non-Christians? ",2,1500479813,2017-07-19 11:56:53
340,"&gt; So you are asking how their work on YEC is viewed by a community that presupposes that YEC is erroneous? 



Yes. Because the main weakness of YEC is that there is deemed no scientific proof for it. If they presented proof (and didnt go with the ""this proves God made it directly"" right off the bat) they might actually get a reception.




Georges Lemaitre was a priest, who came up with the Big Bang Theory in an era where the overwhelming concensus was a steady state universe and the religion/science percieved dichotomy was high.

To every scientist in the world he looked like he was trying to put forward some crackpot theory for Gods existance. But he said ""this is just the science"" and submitted it for peer review. And now it is an accepted theory today. 



If he can do it, any of these scientists can do it.",3,1500479323,2017-07-19 11:48:43

So you are asking how their work on YEC is viewed by a community that presupposes that YEC is erroneous? I am not sure how you want me to answer. Not good I would imagine. Probably about as good as a Muslim would view Christianity, a Red Sox fan would view a Yankee, or my ex-girlfriends would view me. Generally, when one side has a preconceived negative opinion of the other, they don't just welcome them with open arms. There is, however, a peer-reviewed Journal of Creation, but I imagine the other side wouldn't have a high opinion of this either.

Because Augustine said when Christians talk in ignorance about matters of science, then non-Christians in those respective fields of science will only mock and deride them. Go look at any creation science website and all of them make this exact point. The problem with your post is twofold: 1) you presume creation science is not really science, that the biologists, geologists, physicists, cosmologists, paleontologists, etc., in creation science are not doing ""real science"". Because these are the people being mocked, and if you are saying, as Augustine said, that Christians will be mocked for their ignorance, then you have to presume these scientists are ignorant, or else Augustine's point does not have any relevance. Also 2) you seem to presume that only the YEC side has adherents that maintain this ignorance. You overlook the Christians that hold to OEC and TE, not because of their ""scientific brilliance"", but because their secular schooling told them it was fact, and they see people who disagree get mocked and marginalized in the church. These people are no less ignorant, so wouldn't you then have to claim that, if ignorant YECs are doing damage to Christian credibility, then ignorant OECs and TEs are doing the same? Or no, because they agree with the conventional view?

&gt;sometimes even claim that defending YEC is detrimental to the faith at large, (which at times has bordered on insinuating it is actively working against the advancement of the gospel)



St. Augustine - ""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of the world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion""",1,1500462282,2017-07-19 07:04:42

363,"This is what the Catechism of the Catholic Church has to say on the matter:

&gt; *How to read the account of the fall*

&gt; *390* The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man. Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first parents.

Then a bit later on:

&gt; *III. ORIGINAL SIN*

&gt; *Freedom put to the test*

&gt; *396* God created man in his image and established him in his friendship. A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only in free submission to God. The prohibition against eating ""of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" spells this out: ""for in the day that you eat of it, you shall die."" The ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man, being a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to the moral norms that govern the use of freedom.

&gt; *Man's first sin*

&gt; *397* Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command. This is what man's first sin consisted of. All subsequent sin would be disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness.

&gt; *398* In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very act scorned him. He chose himself over and against God, against the requirements of his creaturely status and therefore against his own good. Constituted in a state of holiness, man was destined to be fully ""divinized"" by God in glory. Seduced by the devil, he wanted to ""be like God"", but ""without God, before God, and not in accordance with God"".

So essentially, Adam and Eve are used figuratively to represent mankind's initial rejection of God. Mankind's sin wasn't eating a fruit from a tree, but rather being tempted by the Devil to believe that they did not need God and in doing so rejected their purpose and place within the world.

You haven't told me why any kind of transitional form exists.  From my point of view, they shouldn't if ID were evidently true.  

&gt;&gt;I don't understand why you continuously condemn transitional fossils as being assumed ancestry.

&gt;Look up the definition of ""assume.""

You assume ancestry **in order to predict what should exist within that assumption** so that you can compare that with the actual data.  This is a very effective method for testing evolution, and I want to know your reasoning for why said method does not actually support evolution.  

&gt;Then how come the age of fossils keep changing?

Source, or general places I can go to look into this.  

&gt;Read what you quoted; ""can’t be validated.""

You assert this.  I object to it.  You can make a reasonable prediction based on mitochondrial mutation rates to determine about how long ago something died, and then compare that to all forms of radiometric dating.  When the radiometric dating all matches, it would imply that it is quite accurate.  You can then use various radiometric dating styles to determine the accuracy of each dating method across the spectrum that they are capable of dating to various accuracies.  

Mitochondrial mutation rates are not the only non-radiometric dating method, and those other methods also match.  

All radiometric dating is helped to be more accurate by chemical and physical understanding.  

The use of multiple **independent** dating methods ensures accuracy, and they are validated by both each other and everything we know about geology.  I can't make myself believe YEC has potential when it doesn't seem to me that a solid refutation for geologic time exists.  You haven't come up with any factual explanation for why radiometric dating is not accurate, and the same goes for various other dating methods that confirm what we already knew about radiometric methods.

428,"&gt; You just need to know that biodiversity increases over time, and that everything should have common ancestry, and thus **predict** that there will be transitional forms between two more distinct species

You are not fully representing the prediction.

Darwin: ""But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of **intermediate varieties**, which have formerly existed, **be truly enormous**.""

That's the prediction Darwin states the theory requires; intermediate varieties must be truly enormous.

 Darwin then falsifies his own theory by observation; ""Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such **finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory**.""

Today, **Darwin's theory stands falsified with Darwin's own falsification**, this is known as the missing link problem.

Darwin offered an excuse, the same excuse that's offered today; ""The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.""

But science is about the accumulation of knowledge, an excuse doesn't remove the necessity to prove a theory before it can be accepted as something that is known.

&gt; &gt; All radiometric dating hypotheses beyond the boundary of testing, are unfalsifiable hypotheses, can’t be validated.

Then how come the age of fossils keep changing?

&gt; Not a physicist, but I'm pretty sure that dark matter was accepted because the Milky Way should fly apart, but clearly is NOT doing so.

Other way around, but you couldn't be expected to know that because dark matter is presented as a fact on just about any physics related site. You have to dig really, really deep to find out what it really is, just a calculation adjustment, and why; historically known as the ""missing mass problem. NASA history database: ['Ambartsumian, the large velocity dispersions of clusters indicate they have positive total energy, i.e. **they are disintegrating**, and missing mass is not needed.'](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Biviano2/Biviano4_2.html)

Which means the Milky Way is a young system. [Burbidge &amp; Burbidge and Limber advanced the major argument in favour of the stability of galaxy clusters. If clusters have positive energy, the **time-scale for their disruption is very short**. Clusters **must therefore be young systems.**](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Biviano2/Biviano4_2.html)

Around 1980 Dark Matter became the accepted answer to the missing mass problem; that there is some form of mass that is undetectable according to the current laws of physics that is holding galaxies clusters and superclusters in sustained orbits.

431,"&gt; Thats in humans and highly monitered domestic animals though.

I think the same principle holds true for all mammals and likely all vertebrates.  You need a very large population before these effects average out enough to be selectable.

&gt; If its harmful its selected against. Otherwise it isnt really harmful.

It sounds like you may be trying to define away the problem using words alone?  By defining ""harmful"" as ""whatever selection removes""?  If we use such language we can no longer discuss the problem in meaningful terms.

By harmful I mean a degraded or broken gene or functional RNA.  Our genomes are full of these and all population genetics models and simulations with realistic parameters shows that the number of these increases over time, in spite of selection.

&gt; Why would genetic recombination and genetic purging not fix it?

To a limited extent yes.  Suppose mutations accumulate until we get to the point where mom and dad each have 100,000 harmful mutations, and they each have lots of kids.  Each kid will have a dozen or so new harmful mutations.  But from their parents about 25% of the kids will inherit less than 99,900 harmful mutations, 25% more than 100,100 harmful mutations, and the rest will average around 100,000--the same as their parents.  This can be modeled with a binomial distribution.  So this time there are 2-3 kids who actually have fewer deleterious mutations than their parents!  Problem solved, right?

Not quite.  In this simplistic ""mutation count"" model all deleterious mutations have the same negative effect. But in the real world, some mutations are ten thousand times more harmful than others.  So selection always favors those with the fewest strongly harmful mutations regardless of the total count of harmful mutations.  This is why I said in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6np3nq/dan_graur_argues_at_most_1_of_dna_can_be/dkb9eft/) ""I actually think Graur and Moran's model is too simple"" and their limit of 1 to 1.5 harmful mutations per generation is too low.

John Sanford's program, Mendel's Accountant, simulates this in detail, including accurate genome sizes, mutation rates, the distribution of effects of mutations, recombination rates, and various models of selection.  For example in [this paper](http://robertmarks.org/REPRINTS/BINP/9789814508728_0010.pdf) They assume 10 harmful mutations per generation and see ""a nearly constant accumulation rate of 4.5 [harmful] mutations per individual per generation.""

Those with the worst mutations are always selected away. But most mutations have only very small harmful effects and the whole population gradually accumulates them.

&gt;  how would mutations get to the point to cause catastrophic failure instead of simply killing the individuals with enough harmful mutations

I doubt such a process ever gets to the point where organisms physically can't eat or reproduce.  Rather the next time there's a drought, a harsh winter, or increased predation, fewer survive than what otherwise would.  Then inbreeding from the smaller populations accelerates the decline.

Edit:  Selection is still removing the ones with the worst mutations.  The problem is that the fittest of each generation is still slightly less fit than the previous generation.

&gt; beneficial mutation

We're talking about multiple harmful mutations accumulating in the population each generation.  Beneficial mutations are much too rare to keep up with this.

449,"&gt; If the deleterious mutation rate out of all mutations in functional areas is higher than 4%, then the genome should be even smaller still.

Yes.  If say 5% of mutations in functional areas are deleterious, then only 20% of the genome can be functional, because 5% * 20% is still 1%.

I don't see how you're getting that interpretation out of Graur's paper, or any other number than 1%?  If you don't believe me, here is Larry Moran [saying the same thing](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2017/07/revisiting-genetic-load-argument-with.html) about Graur's paper:

""if there are 100 new mutations in every newborn there will be about 10 deleterious mutations if the entire genome is functional. If only 10% is functional then there will be only 1 deleterious mutation per generation. A mutation load of about one deleterious mutation per generation is the limit that a population can tolerate.  Graur assumes 0.99. Others have proposed that the mutation load could be higher (Lynch, 2010; Agrawal and Whitlock, 2012) but it's unlikely to be more than 1.5. The difference isn't important.""

Moran's 1 deleterious mutation out of 100 total mutations is 1%.  This means only about 1% of the DNA can have a specific sequence.  Otherwise you get more than 1 deleterious mutation per generation which, according to Moran, is above what the population can tolerate.

Note that Moran is using two definitions of functional here.  The first, ""If only 10% is functional"" is talking about DNA that does something useful, but most of the sequence can be changed without any consequence.  The second (the 1%) is the amount of DNA that will have consequence if it is changed, which I refer to as ""Sequence specific function"" in the op title.  This can be confusing because it seems like everyone uses these two definitions interchangeably.

But having this little sequence-specific function is in direct contradiction with a large body of medical research.

* With more harmful mutations, the more offspring you have to have in order to get some, by chance, with no new harmful mutations.  That is what Graur is calculating in your comment.

* If you don't have at least 2 offspring with no harmful mutations, then the whole next generation is worse off than the current one.

* If species always mutate until they go extinct, then evolution fails.  Thus that is why Graur says either ENCODE is right, evolution is wrong.

* Up to 4% of that 25% is subject to deleterious mutations, which is 1%.

459,"&gt;It’s assumed to be “successful predictions” based on assumptions. Which assumption do I assume to assume it was “successful predictions?” Do I use Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and A. W. F. Edwards, which “assumes that genetic differences arise due to genetic drift only,” or do I use Nei's standard genetic distance, which “assumes that genetic differences are caused by mutation and genetic drift,” or do I use Reynolds, Weir, and Cockerham's genetic distance, which “assumes that genetic differentiation occurs only by genetic drift without mutations,” or one of the others?

You don't need to pick one.  You just need to know that biodiversity increases over time, and that everything should have common ancestry, and thus predict that there will be transitional forms between two more distinct species.  The method by which this occurs doesn't need to be known, and Darwin didn't know what it was either.  He just concluded that there must have been descent with modification, likely by stored information, which is how Darwin predicted that DNA existed before DNA was actually discovered.  

If there is a mechanism by which living things reproduce with imperfect traits, and good traits are selected for while bad traits are selected against, then you should expect there to be intermediate forms between two distinct living things, and they should have reasonably predictable traits.  

&gt;All radiometric dating hypotheses beyond the boundary of testing, are unfalsifiable hypotheses, can’t be validated.

How exactly?  What about the vast amount of independent dating methods, of which there is a good handful of non-radiometric, that all match up when expected to?  

&gt;All dating methods for billions of years, and evolution’s timeline, are falsified by scientific observation. The Milky Way isn’t in a sustained orbit and can’t be billions of years old. In the Big Bang Model, a ‘fudge factor’ is added to orbital calculations to exhibit them as being in sustained orbits. The fudge factor is called ‘dark matter,’ something that is impossible to see, but hypothesized to change everything we do see. A ‘fudge factor’ is the official term for something added to a hypothesis to change observation to agree with the hypothesis. If you look up fudge factor on Wikipedia, you’ll see dark matter, dark energy and inflation listed as examples of a fudge factor.

Not a physicist, but I'm pretty sure that dark matter was accepted because the Milky Way should fly apart, but clearly is NOT doing so.  

I don't understand why you continuously condemn transitional fossils as being assumed ancestry.  If you expect ancestry, and predict what fossils you would then expect if that were true, and find those fossils, then it seems as if everything favors ancestry.  

While I want to give credence to ID, it doesn't make sense.  You invoke rapid microevolution with the flood myth, but then when it goes back to the ""kinds"" definition nobody can actually identify it, because the surface level clearly seems to go back farther through ancestry than creationists admit to.  If creation were true, I would expect to find clearly distinct animals with very few shared traits, without any dating method possibly going past 10,000, yet ID does not strike me as evident.  Instead, evolution seems to fit the world far better.  ",2,1500240280,2017-07-16 17:24:40

&gt; So why would you say Neanderthals do or don't count as non-homo-sapien and bipedal? What about Lucy?

Look at what you quoted.

&gt; I don't get what you're saying is an assumption?

Google: ‘a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.’

&gt; You then find fossils that are intermediates between X and Y.

Unproven assumption.

&gt; I want to know exactly why you're saying successful predictions are assumptions, when the ability to use the theory of evolution to predict quite precisely what fossils exist before they are discovered would seem to support the theory?

It’s assumed to be “successful predictions” based on assumptions. Which assumption do I assume to assume it was “successful predictions?” Do I use Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and A. W. F.

&gt; Doesn't digging up more fossils count as experimentation? 

If the experiment proves that a hypothesis regarding the fossils is true, using proven theories, then your experiment is considered scientific knowledge, accepted as a fact. It might be proven false later by you or someone else. In which case, you could modify or abandon the hypothesis.  On the other hand, if your hypothesis was validated by other hypothesis that haven’t been tested, and confirmed, then your hypothesis can’t be accepted as a fact; but it can be considered a good working hypothesis in need of further work.

If you want to discuss the interactions between two particles, then you use information theory. But a cup of water is dominated by emergent effects that information theory doesn't tell you about.

In practical terms, information theory is about how much information can be encoded in a system. In real terms, we're talking about a photon or an interaction in particle physics. Once we start having multiple particles, once they start interacting with each other, information theory doesn't work anymore.

Primarily, information theory is used with computers, where things don't change spontaneously. Reality is very much unlike our computers -- to the point where our computers crash because they don't expect things to change spontaneously. But they do.

So:

&gt; I've never actually heard a good explanation countering the information coming from nothing problem

This is because you don't understand information. The genetic code is inscribed in molecules, not bits, and so information theory is long gone in describing how it operates. It's barely even information -- it's an arbitrary stream of characters that *can* be interpreted by a chemical system. But this code doesn't mean anything to a different system, like a computer. 032 is a codon to DNA, but to a computer it's just some numbers.

Those interpretations that are lethal in the relevant timescale do not propagate. You could produce and refine codes from pure noise at this level of scale.

You might look at [this paper](http://bmi205.stanford.edu/_media/crabtree-2.pdf) from Gerald Crabtree.  He estimates that in the last few thousand years, most humans have accumulated 2 harmful mutations to genes related to emotion and intelligence and he only includes the 2% of the genome that is protein coding.  Although it's more of a back-of-the-envelope calculation than anything rigorous.  He assumes that for evolution to work, selection was much more intense in the past, but he never calculates that part.  At least that's what I remember.  It's been 4 years since I read the paper.

The paper does start with a bang:  ""I would be willing to wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions.""

While it is not expressed with the precision of 19th century scholastic rationalism, Genesis does say to humanity ""from dust you came and to dust you will return."".

Given the incredible amount of redundancy in mammal genomes, I would think we could go on perhaps for a few million years.  I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations [here](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions/#A-Simple-Model).

&gt; Can we expect all species to degrade at roughly the same rate, or will the more genetically complex/simple organisms fall first?

An e coli gets about one mutation every 2000 replications.  Based on the amount of functional DNA humans likely get dozens of harmful mutations each generation, which is much faster than selection can weed them out.  Natural selection can likely preserve e coli indefinitely.

---------

It's worth mentioning there's currently [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/) in DebateEvolution about genetic entropy.  You should study it to familiarize yourself with what critics argue.  But I disagree with all of its main points.  For example:

*  It's not true that error catastrophe has never been observed.  We've seen it [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6895.full.pdf
) or [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/).  The fact that species will go extinct from too many mutations is [widely acknowledged](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions/#2-Genetic-load) and non-controversial.

*  It doesn't make sense that humans are less prone to error catastrophe than viruses.  Humans get more harmful mutations per generation, and selection is far far weaker in a complex organism to weed them out.  Michael Lynch (leading pop geneticist) has [a paper](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/450.full) on this:  ""the efficiency of natural selection declines dramatically between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and multicellular eukaryotes.""  Lynch then goes into the reasons.

*  Because [a virus](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541) with an average of 2.6 harmful mutations per generation didn't decline in fitness, that doesn't mean genetic entropy in animals is nonesense.  First see my previous point.  But viruses also make hundreds of copies of themselves.  That's enough that on average some copies will have 0 new harmful mutations and others will have 5 or more.  I can work this out with the Poisson distribution if you'd like.  But most mammals don't have this way out.

*  It doesn't make sense to argue that only a low single digit percentage of human DNA is subject to harmful mutations.  We [find that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/) ""In fact almost every time you functionally test a non-coding RNA that looks interesting because it's differentially expressed in one system or another, you get functionally indicative data coming out.""  At least 80% of RNA is differentially expressed (ENCODE) and a majority of the nucleotides within these sequences must be specific.

*  I also disagree that a mutation ""doesn't count"" unless it makes it's carrier have fewer children.  Random factors have a much greater effect on how many kids you'll have than a mutation that makes you only 99.9% as strong or as disease resistant as you'd otherwise be.  Those with the worst mutations are always selected away.  But most mutations have only very small harmful effects and the whole population gradually accumulates them.  This has been rigorously modeled in computer simulation.

486,"&gt;So, you have some fossils that are assumed to be ""non-homo-sapien species,"" you have a hypothesis. That hypothesis needs to be tested and validated before it can be considered something that's known to be valid knowledge. Until then, you just have an assumption, something somebody said.

So why would you say Neanderthals do or don't count as non-homo-sapien and bipedal?  What about Lucy?  

&gt;Somebody's assumption can't be considered acquired knowledge until it's been validated.

I don't get what you're saying is an assumption?  You start with the hypothesis that, if everything evolved, there will be intermediates between X and Y.  You then find fossils that are intermediates between X and Y.  

I want to know exactly why you're saying successful predictions are assumptions, when the ability to use the theory of evolution to predict quite precisely what fossils exist before they are discovered would seem to support the theory?  

&gt;Experiments need to be designed to test hypotheses. The most important part of the scientific method is the experiment.

Doesn't digging up more fossils count as experimentation?  You use radiometric dating to figure out how old they are, and then check that they fit into what evolution would expect.  If I'm not mistaken, this would seem to be highly successful?  Or would you say that scientists are shoehorning fossils into the theory?",2,1500224951,2017-07-16 13:09:11
487,"Thanks for the fair and accurate summary.

1) Yes, I believe there is a biological shelf-life.  I do not believe the universe was designed to run in perpetuity.  This covers everything from the heat death of the universe, tiny changes in the gravitational harmony of celestial bodies, and genetic entropy.  I'm sure there would be other stuff as well.

2) I don't think we can expect everything to decay at the same rate.  Just recently I read an article about how genetically stable trees are (was it here?) This is what I would expect because since trees don't ambulate, I would not think they would endure the same sort of varying environmental pressures. Their life cycle can also be considerably longer.
I guess it's possible that complex systems would degrade faster.  But on the other hand, everything has to be at least complex enough to be self replicating.  It could be that the bulk of the complexity is front-loaded at the cellular level.  I don't know.

For what it's worth, while I have no proof, I would not be surprised if humans in the past were generally more mentally stable, or if it would have been easier for them to learn in school how to build an internal combustion engine, (for example).  (not that they had combustion engines, just that learning such mechanical complexities would have come easier if they were ever given the opportunity to learn about them, which whey were not given)

497,"Not entirely sure who your target audience is, so I think this might be lost on you.  

&gt;How would you characterize it, and how does your view of micro-evolution avoid this type of degeneration?

Mutations can add genetic information, and there are examples I could dig up if needed.  Anything that is beneficial is likely to be kept, which includes the loss of genetic information, but if the gain of genetic information is beneficial that also helps.  It depends on how you define information, however.  Once you've lost enough genetic information, you're less likely to benefit from more losses, so the process would reverse.  I'd predict it would likely vary around a balance, or perhaps hit lower/upper bounds.  

[This post](https://dd.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/) from /r/DebateEvolution summarizes pretty well why genetic entropy isn't considered a problem by mainstream science, using proper experimentation to test the hypothesis:  

&gt;After successive generations of reproduction will lead to malicious mutations, and organisms will eventually be incapable of functioning.  

Viruses mutated extremely rapidly, yet scientists were incapable of getting the population to commit suicide via error catastrophe.  This would seem to show that genetic entropy does not occur, and degeneration likely the same (I'm less sure of this).  ",8,1500195713,2017-07-16 05:01:53

499,"&gt; But wouldn't this make your position unfalsifiable?

You got that backwards. That’s not just my position, that’s science’s position. You can’t declare the scientific method unfalsifiable. Its rule is that nothing can be accepted unless it is falsifiable, be able to test and validate.

&gt; If a slow process must be observed, then how would you expect it to be proven to occur if not by looking at it on a smaller scale?

If the process can’t be tested, then it is unfalsifiable. Popper, “**what is unfalsifiable is classified as unscientific**, and the practice of declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be scientifically true is pseudoscience.”

According to one source, there are about 8.7 million species. So, there’s plenty of opportunity to test speciation and evolution. Which brings up an important point, the theory stands falsified by observation. 

&gt; But wouldn't that, being shown to occur naturally, then make sense if you followed fossils back in time?

Science is about the accumulation of knowledge. You don’t accept a hypothesis as knowledge, “make sense,” until it has been tested and validated. 

&gt; It would seem that many fossils have a surprisingly clear pathway of smaller differences that can be extrapolated to the point that you can connect two drastically different animals.

There are assumptions that fossils are branches of a common ancestor of some life forms existing today. But, these are untested and unvalidated assumptions. So, by the rules of science, they can’t be accepted as known knowledge. On top of that, this is based on conflicting assumptions. “Although it is simple to define genetic distance as a measure of genetic divergence, there are **several different statistical measures that have been proposed.** This has happened because **different authors considered different evolutionary models**.” Which assumption do we assume?  

&gt; Essentially, how do you think fossils should be judged, and why?

By the scientific method requiring testing and validation. Because it’s unscientific to accept assumptions without validation.

&gt; What if, in 10,000 years, we have completely different species and records of the old species. Wouldn't that be exactly what evolution claims happens, and how is it different from fossils and even current organisms?

There is a similarity, false assumptions.

Really... you're going to take the high road I see.

&gt;There are 3 species with high homology, and **many species** with functional homology 

Bold mine. I would contest he has been asked to demonstrate this no fewer than a dozen times and has yet to provide any evidence. In fact he's made a number of assertions that directly contradict this statement. 

&gt;You'll see over 3000 entries of 6-aminohexanoate hydrolases (nylon eating enzyme functional homologs) listed. I'd say that's more than 3!

What Sal has done here is do a search by chemical name not by sequence.  Perhaps he doesn't exactly know the difference but it should be obvious. Sort by length for example. Genes that differ in size by **more than 20 fold** Are obviously not homologous.

Fortunately that same website does have a tool to compare gene sequences. If we compare NylB looking for genes with [90% sequence identity](http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/?query=uniprot:P07061*&amp;fil=identity:0.9&amp;sort=score) we get 3 matches (what a coincidence) all of which are named NylB. 

Further this lines up with several other statements made by Sal yesterday. 

&gt;Now what does would nucleotide sequence code to? *sequence removed* Does that protein exist in any Uniprot/Uniparc database? No. Does it have any credible sequence homology in BLASTP after the point where Ohno deleted the Thymine? Nope.

This statement is simular to a number of other creationists have made. By and large they assert that NylB is to dissimilar to other proteins to have evolved and must have been created. Truthfully I've never really felt like looking that up myself. 

The reason I felt pretty confident in this is because it has an easy explanation. It has to do with the Thymine(T) that Sal insinuates must have been fabricated (though it's been sequenced dozens of times by different people)  That T inserted into position 99 specifically, the effect of which was to cause both a frame shift and a start codon.  Which explains why the segment of DNA can have near 100% sequence homology, and seemingly no homology with any known protein. Remember proteins are made from amino acids which or made from 3 nucleotides. Add a nucleotide and the frame shifts meaning entirely new amino acids.

&gt;Yeah and who was the one who taught him this. He messed up the nomenclature till I set him straight over a month ago

Well no you didn't teach me this and after going through my in box I'm virtually certain you didn't need to correct me on this. The reason I didn't feel like going into specifics is for brevity and because I'm on my phone pulling this from memory and my memory doesn't include every suffix for every allele.

&gt;Is he postulating all 3 genes that are not sequence homologous simultaneously and cooperatively evolved most of their nylon eating ability post 1935?

Yes of course I am. And the reason I sound so certain is because *Pseudomonas* evolved two of those genes (NylB and NylA)in the lab. Call me strange but I generally prescribe to the idea that things that are observed to have happened actually happened.

I'm going to leave this convo. There's a sub specifically for debate and all these objections have already been raised there.

25,"&gt;I think his point is that it could have served some other unknown function.

He's been asked for evidence to support that perhaps a dozen times and has simply ignored the question. He put me on ignore when I asked.

Further he's demonstrated this gene only has one function since according to the data he posted there not one single related gene. 

You can't prove a negative. Or in this case without omniscience you can't prove this has no function. Though it would be easy to show this gene functioning in some other way. However if the only place this gene exists is in the 3 bacteria that that eat nylon and no where else (even simular genes)  it's a fairly safe bet.

&gt;but are you claiming that this gene represents brand new information in the genome

To be blunt it's about as obvious as you could get. Even if this mutation appeared countless times before it litteraly did nothing until it was in an environment that contained nylon. It was just a bunch of transcribe amino acids that did nothing, as evidenced by the fact no other organism has a related gene.

A novel gene that provides a benifit to the cell under specific environmental conditions. I don't know how you can't define that as not new genetic info.

In fact the process gets even more complex when you factor in NylB is step 2 in a multi step process. Wild bacteria use a gene called NylC to break down nylon into a chemical that NylB (the gene being talked about in this thread) breaks down further... which is than further broke down by other metabolic processes. There's even multiple versions of NYLC which are effective under differing PH conditions.

This makes the entire process irreducibly complex since it (now) relies on each step being in place for the system to work. Also of interest this was replicated in the lab. Except the lab version developed a different gene (NylA) as the initial first step. 

How do creationists explain that? Well it's been my experience they just pretend most of it doesn't exist. Instead they focus on NylB and since it was really only a single mutation nessasary, and claim it must have always been there for some reason. Dispite not having been found anywhere else.

Anyways there's a debate sub for this.. and I'm on my phone pulling this almost entirely from memory.",13,1495668195,2017-05-24 19:23:15

&gt;Mutations are random. Selective forces are certainly not. Just in the time it took me to write this sentence every possible mutation has taken place in bacteria given the huge size of the population. 

Yes, so 2 residue mutation might easily reappear and disappear, and hence a 2 residue variation aren't new allele, they just are alleles that haven't persisted until Nylon appeared. [I use the term ""allele"" which is sometimes used for bacteria even though it is primarily used in the diploid context.]
[As evidence to that fact I'll point out Sal rightly showed that there exist no homologs to the gene NylB other than the 3 species of bacteria that live in an environment containing nylon.]

That's incorrect.  There are 3 species with high homology, and many species with functional homology with E-values above coincidental accidents, especially if we are talking amino acids rather than nucleo bases.  Further we may not have even sequenced 99% of the bacteria out there.

Go here:
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=6-aminohexanoate+hydrolase&amp;sort=score

You'll see over 3000 entries of 6-aminohexanoate hydrolases  (nylon eating enzyme functional homologs) listed.  I'd say that's more than 3!

&gt;There's also 2 other genes involved with digesting nylon. NylA and NylC. Those are often overlooked but important since the entire thing is a multiple step process.

Yeah and who was the one who taught him this.  He messed up the nomenclature till I set him straight over a month ago.  There are more than one variety of nylon, and NylC and NylA digest the oligomer variety which is more complex into the simpler variety of dimers which NylB digests.  So we have a coordinated digestion cascade.  Is he postulating all 3 genes that are not sequence homologous simultaneously and cooperatively evolved most of their nylon eating ability post 1935?


I should point out 2 amino acid mutations out of 392 is only 0.5% change.  That is well within Luria Delbruck distributions to suggest the nylon eating allele (if it wasn't common) had appeared in the past only to drift out of the population.  It's hardly a new trait.

30,"&gt;this nylonase gene appeared in response to nylon, 

Agreed, that's what they say.  I claim they are wrong.

A more appropriate characterization is that the nylonase gene pre-existed nylon and that the term ""nylonase"" is a bit of misnomer since the enzyme may have been around before 1935 providing a biological function.

If there was evolution, it was evolution of an allele of that gene.  That is a highly important distinction.  Even DarwinZDF42 tried to portray this as emergence of a brand new complex trait involving multiple enzymes, and that's a lot of spin on his part.

Kato in 1991 showed as little as 2 residue mutations in a homologous  enzyme enabled a substantial increase in nylonase digestion.  That is to say, an allele for a pre-existing gene was created by humans in the lab with only 2 residue mutations, thus showing in principle as little as 2 residues could be involved in tweaking a pre-existing gene to create nylonase ability.   

I'm arguing the nylonase gene existed prior to 1935, and that calling it a nylonase is a bit of a misnomer since the gene was obviously functional for something else since the sequence exists in other life forms.  In evolutionary jargon, we say the ""sequence has evidence of pre-1935 conservation.""  We only call it nylonase, and thus giving a prejudicial spin of the facts by giving it a name that suggests the gene didn't exist pre-1935.  The gene existed, the nylonase allele may or may not have been abundant.

&gt;If I understand you, you are saying that this mutation had to exist before nylon in order to be selected for. That seems more in harmony with the idea that mutations are random.

That's assuming there was a mutation after 1935, if at all!  There may not have been a mutation, and they only asserted without any proof that there was a post 1935 mutation.  The only way they can establish that a mutation actually happened is to have a sample of the bacteria pre-1935 which they don't.

Their argument is as silly as saying that rocks evolved the ability to break car windows only after car windows were made since car windows didn't exist a few hundred years ago.  That would be a silly argument since rocks had the ability to break windows even before windows existed.  It didn't have to evolve that ability.

In like manner, the researchers have zero proof a pre-existing enzyme used for some other purpose had to change in order to digest nylon.  They have zero proof, just a silly claim that since nylon appeared in 1935, the gene must have evolved shortly thereafter to eat it!

And even if there was some moderate evolutionary change, it could be as little as an allele re-emergence through point mutation of an existing gene, not creation of a new gene through gene duplication post 1935 and frame shift mutations.

I'm pointing out, urban legends are getting passed on as actual experiments and observations when there is no real data to that effect.  You'd think scientists would actually be above that, but when it comes to evolutionary biology, fantasies are passed off as experimental facts.

If anyone doubts me, we can see if the boys at r/debateevolution can actually come up with real counter arguments to my findings, like say samples of pre 1935 bacteria in some lab refrigerator!",5,1495646548,2017-05-24 13:22:28

Interestingly enough, this is one of the papers I cited to you.

But...no:

&gt;We have extended our previous analysis of the pedigree rate of control-region divergence in the human mitochondrial genome. One new germline mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was detected among 185 transmission events (generations) from five Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) pedigrees. Pooling the LHON pedigree analyses yields a control-region divergence rate of 1.0 mutation/bp/10^6 years (Myr).

It estimates 1 mutation per basepair per million years. That's very different than 1 site per million years.

&gt;This paper comparing humans and chimps estimates 0.07 mutations per million years, and thus mtEve at 143k.

I assume you mean this line:

&gt;The estimated substitution rate in the D-loop region was 7.00 x 10-8/site per year. Using both synonymous and D-loop substitutions, we inferred the age of the last common ancestor of the human mtDNAs as 143,000 ± 18,000 years.

As a result, a lot of the mutations seen are in hotspots: third-letter oscillating changes, synonym codons that keep switching back and forth.

&gt;But they are still measuring 10-6 mutations per site per year--around the same rate YECs cite.

Once we divide the 3 10-6 rate by the 4 synonyms, we get back to 10-7 rate we see in the mitochondrial eve studies.

It really isn't that far off, not enough to put us at 6K for mtEve -- but even accepting the lower bound of 6K [yes, it was a lower bound, my calculation using their numbers suggests a range between 6,000 and 12,000 years, not bounded around 6,000], we then have to deal with Y-Adam being older.",4,1495428577,2017-05-22 00:49:37

If you take the mtDNA of several brothers/sisters you can do comparisons to see which mtDNA mutations were in the parent or even grandparent germline.  I would think it would be easy to eliminate somatic mutations, and also hteroplasmy.  Given the problem with somatic mutations has been known since at least 2003 (the date of your paper), and how easy it is to correct, I would think pedigree studies have been doing that since then?

But they are still measuring 10^-6 mutations per site per year--around the same rate YECs cite.  The papers that estimate a 200ka mtEve use mutation rates something around 10^-8 per site per year.  And indeed they say their rate is ""10-fold higher than that obtained with phylogenetic analyses"" and they speculate reasons why it doesn't match.

[This paper is more or less the direct response,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180241/) and they found something interesting:

&gt;There will be a countervailing inflation of the pedigree rate if a large proportion of the mutations are somatic rather than germline.

A prominent example of this was found:

&gt;Finally, divergence of complete mtDNA sequences was analyzed in two tissues, white blood cells and skeletal muscle, from each of 17 individuals. In three of these individuals, there were four instances in which an mtDNA mutation was found in one tissue but not in the other.

Thus, there are reasons to doubt the results of the pedigree studies, given they tend to produce results several times higher than germline studies: we are capturing mutations in cells that will not be passed on as they are not in the germline.

The slow estimate is based on germline mutations, which represent a very minor proportion of cells, but the entire proportion of evolutionary genetics. The point mutations that occur year on year in 90% of the cells in my body are never going to be passed on.",4,1495424768,2017-05-21 23:46:08

[This](http://www.dnai.org/teacherguide/pdf/reference_romanovs.pdf) is from a piece in the journal Science when the observed mtDNA mutation rates first came to light back in 1998:

&gt; ""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate. For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old. No one thinks that's the case, but at what point should models switch from one mtDNA time zone to the other?""

From there they propose without any evidence that over thousands of generations, selection slows down the substitution rate.    But how do they get the 200k years?  By filling in the mutation rate needed to have humans and chimps share a common ancestor ~5-6 million years ago.

But in terms of observed mtDNA mutation rates, I've never seen any that come close to 200k years.  There's variation but some are even less than 6000 years.",2,1495422798,2017-05-21 23:13:18

74,"I fully agree with what you just said.  But let's step back and look at the context of what we're discussing:

Some people argue that humans could not have come from an original pair because there are various papers that estimate minimum human population sizes much larger than 2.    A lot of these papers (all of them?) that measured heterogeneity did not take gene conversion into account, and thus got much larger than necessary minimum population estimates.  I know this because I've read several that specifically noted large variation at HLA sites, but we now know that HLA sites are subject to gene conversion, creating rapid variation.

What Fuz Rana is saying is that it's worse for those studies because they also do not take individual assessments into account.  This can't even be done reliably because there are too many possible parameters.  Yes it would be good if creation geneticists put forward a model showing origination from a single pair can work with some of the possible parameters, but afaik this hasn't been done yet.",3,1495406299,2017-05-21 18:38:19

76,"&gt; When populations are very small, minor statistic errors become massive influences.

Thus mine and Rana's point, and these statistical errors are amplified the more unknowns there are, such as in the remote past of human ancestry.

77,"I don't think you understand how these models are supposed to be applied, nor what these papers are discussing. 

The large population models are meant to be applied to large populations, where sampling every individual would be prohibitive. They are going to have a level of noise, because you're using estimates based on statistical modelling, sampling a portion of the population. This is mathematically proven, so we'll move on.

This kind of modelling relies on the law of large numbers. When populations are very small, minor statistic errors become massive influences. And thus, a large population model is not going to correct predict for a small starting population. And, as you might have guessed, 3 is not a large number and thus the large population models do not produce accurate results for this deer population.

The model introduced paper #5 is designed to bridge the gap between between small populations and large populations, as would occur in the common case of a reintroduction effort, such as these deer, or an Adam and Eve scenario. According to this paper and it's data, the model is accurate for modelling deer reintroduction efforts. 

Rana is complaining that the old model doesn't work by citing a paper describing the solution to the problem he's raising. Then he ignores the paper's solution. Honestly, this is a nonsense objection.

If you want to raise objections, then start producing your own models. Simply claiming that other models have errors doesn't change the fact that there's still nothing close to functional from Adam-Eve (4000BC) that would adequately model for humanity's diversity today.",5,1495392606,2017-05-21 14:50:06
78,"The only way the authors in source #5 were able to build an accurate model was to input additional parameters specific to the deer population and model it to the level of individuals.  Without this data, classical population genetics model over-estimated the minimum population size of the deer.

Do the minimum human population studies have this data?  No.  Do they model it on the level of individuals?  Without this data, they can't.  Are they therefore also likely to over-estimate minimum populations?  According to comparing the classical vs individual models with these deer--yes.

So yes, Fuz Rana is right.  If you read the paper as you claimed, why did you say ""the diversity was completely in line with the model as predicted,"" not even mentioning that they were invalidating the classical population genetics model?

Yes, did you?

&gt;In contrast to the classic theory, an individual-based population genetic model predicts that final heterozygosity is largely independent of the initial heterozygosity H0 in the founding population

These lines describe different models. 

This paper is about testing a small founding population model and confirms that model's accuracy beyond the general model, which was not as accurate for very small founding populations.

&gt;So Fuz Rana is right, and he accurately cites source #5. What do you think he is lying about, and what do you think is junk-science?

He's not raising a meaningful objection. The model in use in #5 is a model for small founding populations and it is accurate, contrary to his assertion that these models don't work.

&gt;  General population genetic theory predicts that a sudden reduction in effective population size leads to an exponential decay in heterozygosity with a loss rate determined by the effective population size. When ignoring mutations [formula omitted] where the heterozygosity at time t (Ht) is given by the initial heterozygosity H0 of the founders declining with a rate inversely related to the time-specific effective population size Ne_i. It has been recognised that this theorem can be oversimplistic when considering natural populations. For example, **many populations have retained more of their diversity after a bottleneck than was predicted.**

They say in the discussion

&gt; In terms of **classic population genetic theory**, this high level of retention of heterozygosity in a population presumably founded by four individuals is **unexpected**. 

And at the end:

&gt;  founding a population on the basis of few iteroparous individuals may have little consequences for its genetic diversity, at least in terms of heterozygosity. This may seem **surprising** on the basis of general population genetic theory

They are saying that the classical population genetics models (the ones everyone is using) over-estimate heterozygosity reduction from a population bottleneck.  Hence they produced a more detailed model that includes more parameters from the white-tail deer population.  And only in reference to this this new model (in 2012) they say what you quoted:  ""Observed H [heterozygosity] was in line with predictions""

So Fuz Rana is right, and he accurately cites source #5.  What do you think he is lying about, and what do you think is junk-science?

Three ""days"" later, on Day Four, the Greater and Lesser Lights were created which were to rule the light and dark portions of the ""day"" respectively.

The most reasonable interpretation is that whatever that dark/light period called ""Day Four"" was, it was the same thing as the first three ""days"".

Although it might be conceivable that the length of the dark and light periods of Days One, Two, and Three were of a different length than the lengths of the dark and light periods of Days Four, Five, and Six, the physical laws of conservation of momentum, etc, constrains any changes in the length to very small variations, assuming that the physical process of an alternating dark/light period of the first three ""Days"" was the same process as that of the next four ""Days"", that is, a rotation of the viewpoint (Earth's surface, or nearby) relative to the light source, whatever it was.

In addition, unless God changes the meaning of ""day"" a couple of times within one breath in Exodus 20:11 without any such indication of such a variable meaning in that one breath, the ""day"" which is equivalent to a normal human work-week day is the same ""day"" as each of the Days of Creation.

Another strike against the idea that Sinosauropteryx represented a stage in feather evolution is that Archaeopteryx, about 30 million years older, could already fly, according to Feduccia.](https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/are-birds-dinosaurs-new-evidence-muddies-picture)",3,1494908395,2017-05-16 00:19:55

Given your response, I'm not sure either. 


...........  

&gt; I am not sure why you started with the eons.

Because, again, it goes to the whole point of this discussion: is the correct translation of 'yom' (a) a short period of time, i.e. a single rotation of the earth in relation to a light source, or (b) a longer period of time i.e. an age/eon.

...........  

&gt;So any day with a morning and evening is 24 hours is what you are telling me?

I'm telling you that the Genesis author is being as clear as he could be than the meaning of 'yom' that he was referencing was the single normal day meaning, and not the eon meaning.

...........

&gt; You said the language in the text using the terms morning and evening mean that the day length was 24 hours. I am asking you to explain that meaning. Where do you get that meaning from?

Like I said, words have meanings. Words have to have meanings before any intelligent conversation is possible. I'm using the meanings from [here](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=define%3Amorning) and [here](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=define%3Aevening).


...........  



&gt;All days of all moons and planets have mornings and evenings and they are not 24 hours. 

Agreed. But importantly, nor are they are eons. 


...........  


&gt; I am asking you to explain to me how you know the morning and evening days in genesis were 24 hours, based on your explanation of them having a morning and an evening.

Yet again, the whole point of this discussion is to consider the correct translation of 'yom'. Is it: (a) a short period of time, i.e. a single rotation of the earth in relation to a light source, or (b) a longer period of time i.e. an age/eon.

Based on the simple meanings of the words, it must be (a).


...........  


&gt;Because a morning and evening is an inherent part of any day. 

Morning &amp; evening **are** an inherent part of day if we're talking about the (a) meaning. The are **not** part of the meaning of the (b) meaning. Therefore, again, the Genesis author must have be talking about the (a) meaning.

The ""day"" may have been a modern meaning of about 24 hours.  It was a later terminology to describe an event where the word ""day"" really had no meaning at the time.

The question may be asked, why then should we believe Genesis if parts of it were amended or written hundreds or thousands of ears after the events?    Well, that is the point of creation science!

And even 15-20 km is a lot. The English Channel is only 33 km wide and was first swam in [1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Webb), it took 22 hours, and this was coming from a man who had been practicing for two years.

And while there are many other traversals, these seem to be the aimless wanderings of coastal creatures rather than, say, all of the kangaroos crossing the same strait that they have no business being able to cross.

I personally find it more believable that a number of coastal creatures have spread out across the ocean, than that all of the components of a number [distinct desert bioregions](http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue36/6/images/figure4.jpg) were able to cross the ocean in a shorter period of time.

After all, evolutionary biogeography gives millions of years for animals to cross the ocean a few times, while [some estimates](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/timeline-for-the-flood/) give a meagre 4359 years for the entirety of Australia's ecosystems to migrate, leaving no trace behind in Eurasia.

&gt; while the monkeys only needed to have successfully made one trip.

Evolutionary biogeography proposes many more traversals than just the monkeys, over distances much larger than 15-20km.  [Some examples](http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(04\)00336-2):

3.  ""Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts),"" Darwin noted in The Origin of Species, ""have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded."" He explained this absence by the fact that amphibians are quickly killed by seawater and are thus unlikely to cross oceans successfully. No biogeographer doubts that amphibians and certain other organisms (e.g. most terrestrial mammals, flightless birds) are especially poor oceanic dispersers. However, some recent studies show that it is unsafe to assume that such organisms never colonize new areas by crossing ocean barriers.  A striking example concerns two mantellid frog species found on Mayotte, an island of the Comoros archipelago some 300 km west of Madagascar. The two species had been described as conspecific with taxa on Madagascar (where nearly all other mantellids are found) and were assumed to have been introduced. However, morphology and DNA sequences indicate that the two Mayotte taxa are distinct new species and, therefore, are natural endemics. The Comoros are volcanic and have never been attached to other landmasses; thus, the results strongly imply origins by natural, overwater dispersal. Furthermore, the two species are not closely related within the Mantellidae, indicating two independent dispersal events.
Another case involves the carnivores and lemurs of Madagascar, medium-sized mammals that are considered poor oceanic dispersers. Yoder et al. found through molecular dating analyses that both groups diverged from African mainland relatives long after the separation of Madagascar from Africa. The estimated divergence dates also do not match the hypothesized existence of a Cenozoic land bridge between Africa and Madagascar. Thus, both groups seem to have reached Madagascar by oceanic dispersal, perhaps facilitated by the ability to go into torpor. Other examples of unexpected oceanic dispersal include monkeys from Africa to South America, flightless insects from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, multiple dispersals by chameleons in the Indian Ocean, several other amphibian cases, and, more controversially, flightless ratite birds to New Zealand. Although Darwin apparently was wrong in thinking that amphibians never cross saltwater, these cases reinforce a general message of the great evolutionist: given enough time, many things that seem unlikely can happen.""

My point is that both views have problems, and I think the evolutionary biogeography is more problematic.",1,1494256582,2017-05-08 11:16:22
254,"&gt; Getting large animals to Australia is a problem, but less of a problem than having monkeys cross thousands of miles of the Atlantic on rafts to get to South America, as evolutionary bio-geography proposes.

I disagree.

Getting animals to Australia requires creatures making the trip hundreds and hundreds of times, while the monkeys only needed to have successfully made one trip.

&gt; At least the YEC's could suggest humans brought them in their own migrations, as strange as that sounds.

Unless you're referring to the monkeys, in which case that implies someone went to the effort of rounding up only the monkeys who lived in Central America before the flood, and escorting all the way across Asia, across the (mostly closed) Bering Strait, and all the way down North America before setting them loose back in Central America.

Think of all the complex food chains that many animals have.  In a cataclysmic world you can't just decide to go on a big trek without having a known food supply.

I don't have all the answers but I know this.  The world had to practically move the animals there... or it occurred over millenia.

I don't believe it happened over millenia, so by default I think the world transported the animals there and that's why I believe the hydroplate theory.

&gt;“Researchers uncover thousands of genes whose activity varies between men and women.”[1] Specifically, their study found 6,500 genes were differentially expressed. They concluded that men and women are distinctly dimorphic, consequently one result of this fact is that they have very dissimilar disease susceptibilities.[2] The sexual dimorphic traits result mainly from differential expression of the genes that exist in both sexes. These results strongly go against the current politically correct view that the only differences between males and females are a few minor plumbing variations and a couple of small hormones.

&gt;Two researchers, Shmuel Pietrokovski and Moran Gershoni, evaluated organ-, tissue-, and individual-specific gene expression from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTex) Portal data base. Researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science produced a comprehensive genetic map of the genes that are differentially expressed in men and women.[3]

&gt;This was not the first research in this area. One study found that mutations likely accumulated in genes that produced sperm because these mutations were expressed only in men. As a result, harmful mutations that cause health problems or death in only half of the population are passed on by women who have no sign of the mutation. The result is even further evidence for the accumulation of deleterious mutations that leads to mutational meltdown, the exact opposite that is required for Darwinian evolution. Evolution is thus true, but going backwards.


I should note, the specialness of male and female in humans can be contrasted to turtles and other creatures.  Male and female turtles are identically genetically, but they differentiate based on temperature!",6,1494251170,2017-05-08 09:46:10

Additionally, it is not just living kangaroos but also fossilized kangaroos that are only found in Australia, suggesting that whatever the previous surface of the earth was like, they had only lived there before, were brought to the Ark, and then were brought back to the same general location.

For those who believe in a global flood, some believe natural explanations can offer reasonable possibilities for all of these challenges. Others do not believe this is reasonable, but since the story of Noah's flood contains numerous other divine interventions, they have no problem appealing to unrecorded miracles to explain anything that cannot be explained naturally.

Those who believe Noah's story can be reasonably interpreted as a large regional flood believe that since God used natural physical water to drown the wicked and a natural phyiscal ark to preserve those on the ark from drowning, except for brief recorded miraculous interventions (ex. to close the door, etc), it is unreasonable to suppose that he used countless unrecorded miracles to get those animals back to their previous locations and keep natural physical processes from killing them all before they got there. It's not that they don't believe God *could* have used miracles to do this, they just don't think the Bible or the physical evidence indicates that he *did*.",3,1494248952,2017-05-08 09:09:12

263,"&gt; If you place the Ice age shortly after the flood. At the last glacial maximum, Australia would be connected to Asia.

Nope.

Look carefully at that map again - I'm sure you noticed that Australia and New Guinea are connected by a continental plateau (the [Sahul Shelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahul_Shelf)), but you will also notice that in between New Guinea and Sulawesi is a region of much deeper ocean floor.

That region, [Wallacea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallacea), has much deeper oceans than even the most extreme estimates would suggest were exposed during the ice age.

[This map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Last_glacial_vegetation_map.png/450px-Last_glacial_vegetation_map.png) of ice age biomes, and [this map](https://iceagenow.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sea_Level_Last_Ice_Age.gif) of ice age topography both show Australia completely cut off from the rest of Asia.

Scientists [absolutely agree](http://www.starfish.ch/Zeichnung/Karten/Wallacea-migration.gif) that there was migration across the region during this time, however they still had to cross a number of straits. 

While crossing the ocean is something we can reasonably expect adaptable creatures like water rats and bats (the placental mammals native to Australia) to do, Australia's more famous animals would have a great deal more difficulty making the cross - Australia's vast array of desert dwelling reptiles would have found crossing any water essentially impossible.",4,1494224019,2017-05-08 02:13:39

(BTW, woolly mammoths are not designed for cold environments--no oil glands like a polar bear, so they'd get ice to freeze in their fur and croak from exposure.)

Why only some animals in certain areas?  Well...it's all about location. Things that can fight for resources stay.  Things that can't, move.  I think that 6,000 years is a better explanation, because with millions of years, you're looking at a far more homogeneous ecosystem than you have today.

It only stands to reason that many unrecorded events were handled by God to make sure that the earth was still inhabitable. Perhaps humans were commissioned by God to knowingly or unknowingly transport animals and the proper food source when needed or he used his angels to assist in distributing the animals. The Bible does not say, but clearly the important issues were recorded in the account . Noah left an example of faith and an amazing example of doing the nearly impossible task of building the ark with Gods help ( he provided the plans)  when all other people had turned their backs on God! Knowing the details would be nice but clearly God preserved the parts that would do us the most good along with a promise to never flood the earth again.",3,1494212447,2017-05-07 23:00:47

This accounts for the unique fauna just as well as the bajillion year theory as far as I'm concerned.  Say The ice age began to wane 300-500 years after the flood, You have Australia not only separating first, but it is also a smaller region, so it won't be filled in later by species from very far away.

Ah, hey, I did think of something creationist to contribute.

278,"This would normally be a TLDR from me, but I'm a text guy.

First, Westcott and Hort did not produce any significant translation. They produced a Greek New Testament.

Second, no current translation is based on the Westcott and Hort GNT. They are based on the 26th, 27th, and 28th editions of the Nestle-Aland GNT. This GNT is not the same as the WH GNT, though it is of the same general type.

Third, there are no significant differences between the KJV's Textus Receptus and the Nestle-Aland editions when it comes to creation.

Fourth, the KJV and the modern bibles use more or less an identical Hebrew Old Testament. Creation is an overwhelmingly Old Testament subject. The KJV is translated from the Complutensian Polyglot and the new bibles are translated from the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, both of which came from Codex Leningradensis, a representative of the Masoretic Text.

Effectively, Westcott and Hort had absolutely nothing to do with the Bible as it teaches about creation.

If you want to complain about differences between the KJV and other bibles, please make it pertain to creation. And if there is some significant difference between another bible and the KJV regarding creation, leave Westcott and Hort out of it unless it pertains to a New Testament verse that had something to do with Westcott and Hort.

I'm reading your comments with others, and after a huge OP on a creationist subreddit about Westcott and Hort, you seem to be arguing with everyone simply about differences between the KJV and other bibles. Nothing about creation, nothing about Westcott and Hort. You're just wasting everyone's time piping about KJV only on a creationist subreddit.

I haven't failed, I was never asked. Here's one within the last 10 years for you.

Take a look at Genesis 3:16 in the ESV Text (2011):

Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.

Here's the same verse in the Permanent Text (ESV 2016):

Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you.

**EDIT:** More fun facts.

A breakdown of the massive delta in word count between the ESV and KJV includes:

ESV removes 2,088 words from the Gospels, 754 words from Acts and 1,353 words from Genesis. Every book in the Bible is important, but to my mind these really stand out.


The ESV also removes the word 'Christ' three times from the Words of Jesus Christ, or the red letter words in your Bible. Once in Matthew 23:8, Mark 13:6 and Luke 21:8. In two of these three instances (Mark 13:6 and Luke 21:8), these are parallel verses in which Jesus warns of false Christs. That's not very nice. In addition, the ESV removes 'Satan' from the Words of Jesus Christ once, which can be found in Luke 4:8. Apart from the Words of Jesus Christ, the ESV removes the word 'Satan' from Psalm 109:6 and replaces it with 'an accuser'. We should not think that this is a trend, though, because any form of the root word 'accuse' also occurs two fewer times in the ESV than in the KJV.

Here are some interesting comparisons between key words and the frequency of their occurrence between the KJV and the ESV. Thankfully, words like 'Antichrist', 'Messiah' and 'Anointed' occur with the same frequency between the KJV and the ESV, unlike these:

Soul: 537 (KJV), 283 (ESV) -254

Ghost: 109 (KJV), 3 (ESV), -106

Evil: 624 (KJV), 531 (ESV), -93

Beast: 337 (KJV), 248 (ESV), -89

Devil: 116 (KJV), 34 (ESV), -82

Save: 349 (KJV), 296 (ESV), -53

Wicked: 367 (KJV), 321 (ESV), -46

Hell: 54 (KJV), 14 (ESV), -40

Christ: 573 (KJV), 535 (ESV), -38

Grace: 170 (KJV), 135 (ESV), -35

God: 4717 (KJV), 4691 (ESV), -26

Miracle: 37 (KJV), 12 (ESV), -25

Jesus: 984 (KJV), 966 (ESV), -16

Heaven: 739 (KJV), 734 (ESV), -5

Mary: 54 (KJV), 54 (ESV), 0

Mammon: 4 (KJV), 0 (ESV), -4

Error: 17 (KJV), 14 (ESV), -3

Heresy: 4 (KJV), 1 (ESV), -3

Satan: 56 (KJV), 54 (ESV) -2

Angel: 297 (KJV), 295 (ESV), -2

Apostle: 79 (KJV), 78 (ESV), -1

Holy: 654 (KJV), 698 (ESV), +44

Spirit: 551 (KJV), 604 (ESV), +53

It is perhaps a strange coincidence that the concept of a soul is not in agreement with the Darwinism which Westcott and Hort were proponents of and that the frequency in which the word appears decreased so drastically (-52.7%). Likewise, the word 'Ghost' was nearly eliminated entirely from the Bible along with the words 'Miracle' (-68.6%) Hell' (-75.1%). Sadly, 'Mammon' (-100%) disappears altogether in the ESV. Most, if not all of the reduction in the frequency of these words as found in the Bible seem to be related to doctrines that the two Anglican translators of the 19th Century struggled with. 

What better way to itch our ears spiritually than to increase the frequency with which the words 'holy' and 'spirit' occur while simultaneously decreasing the frequency that the words Jesus, Christ, Satan and God occur? What possible reason could there be for such a pattern?

Verses Removed:

ESV is gender neutral, removing 'man' and 'men' 968 times and 'he', 'him', or 'his', 1832 times. 'Human' is substituted for 'man' 63 times.

In addition, the following 17 verses are removed from the ESV:

Matthew 12:47
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

Matthew 17:21
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

Matthew 18:11

Matthew 23:14
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.

Mark 9:44
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

Mark 9:46
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

Mark 11:26
But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.

Mark 15:28
28  And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

Luke 17:36

Luke 22:44

Luke 23:17
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

John 5:4
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

Acts 8:37
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

Acts 15:34
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

Acts 24:7 (note half of Acts 24:6 and 24:8 is also removed)
7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,

Acts 28:29
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.

Romans 16:24
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

The ESV removes 33,000 words in the New Testament alone. There are 179,011 words in the New Testament of the King James Version. So, the ESV removes approximately 1/5 of the New Testament (18.434621336119% to be exact). This is equivalent in word count to removing the books of Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians entirely. That is just over half of the Epistles authored by Paul. The King James Bible has 66 Books, 1,189 Chapters, 31,102 Verses and 788,280 Words.

**TL;DR**

Here's a quick and easy way to disprove your claim with respect to doctrine from the ESV 2011-2016 delta above. 

If all of this wasn't bad enough, the W-H Greek Text agrees with only around 5 of more than 5,000 manuscripts and collated texts. Even if Westcott &amp; Hort claimed divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they've made changes to key verses such as the Fall of Man between 2011 and 2016. Was the Holy Spirit wrong? Did God change his mind?

Take a look at Genesis 3:16 in the ESV Text (2011):

Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.

Here's the same verse in the Permanent Text (ESV 2016):

Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you.

In conclusion, if a Pastor preached on the Fall of Man from the ESV any time before 2016, the Pastor has either:


	1. Lied to your congregation.

	2. The ESV committee has lied to him.

	3. God has lied to us all.


Pick one. Oh, and enjoy never hearing a sermon on mammon. That one's on the house.

288,"That's a lie. How many of the manuscripts do we have today that align with the Westcott &amp; Hort? It's a very small number. In addition, if you wanted to make an updated version of the Bible, why would you use the Vaticanus? It's literally been scribbled all over by what looks like the infants of antiquity.

To quote the part of the OP you definitely missed: 

&gt;The King James Bible is translated from the Textus Receptus Greek text “family”. The Textus Receptus Greek Texts agree with over 99% of the 5,686 Greek manuscripts. For that reason, the Textus Receptus is also called the “Majority” text. (The “majority” of the Greek texts agree with Textus Receptus).",1,1494146123,2017-05-07 04:35:23
289,"Indeed; the more recently-discovered New Testament manuscripts reliably date closer to the time of the original composition of the New Testament texts than the manuscripts on which the KJV is based. Say what you will about Westcott and Hort, plenty of faithful New Testament scholars have vetted the Greek text selection and translation of the ESV and other popular modern translations.

Textual criticism and selection is a complicated field, but generally ""older"" manuscripts take priority over ""more numerous"" manuscripts when it comes to selecting a text to form a basis for translation, so your argument that the Textus Receptus has majority agreement doesn't really hold water. Modern Bible translations choose texts that faithful scholars, with all the tools available to them, select based on what they are convinced are closest to the original writings of the apostles.

You also have failed to produce even one example of a place where Westcott and Hort's malicious manuscript selection has perverted any major Christian doctrine. I don't doubt that you could if you tried hard enough, but the fact that there are no major debates within Christianity that center around differences in manuscript selection is telling.

Finally, as you mentioned in your post, this sub is largely based on the book of Genesis, which is translated from Hebrew, not Greek. Most Hebrew Bibles are based entirely on one complete manuscript, called the Masoretic text, with footnotes added to note variant readings from other texts. A good commentary would also include the Septuagint, which is Greek, but the authoritative text is agreed to be the Hebrew.

A day might not seem like a long time for creation, but the alternative, Big Bang, requires that the Universe was created in less than one trillionth of one trillionth of a second; called '[inflation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)).'

&gt;What is the strongest point of the alternative view?

There isn't a single scientific theory, [a coherent group of propositions formulated to explain a group of facts or phenomena in the natural world and **repeatedly confirmed through experiment or observation**](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scientific-theory), that contradicts it.

The taught alternative, the Big Bang, isn't a 'scientific theory', it's a 'model.'

According to scientific observation, ""[repeatedly confirmed through experiment or observation](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scientific-theory),"" the Milky Way can't be billions of years old because all observations show that it's flying apart; [""Ambartsumian, the large velocity dispersions of clusters indicate they have positive total energy, i.e. **they are disintegrating**...""](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Biviano2/Biviano4_2.html)

The Big Bang model uses Fudge Factors to change scientific observation to agree with its model. A Fudge Factor is ""[an ad hoc quantity or element introduced into a calculation, formula or model **in order to make it fit observations** or expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_factor).""

So, scientific observation doesn't disagree with the Bible's time line, but the taught alternative, the Big Bang, is falsified by observation.

These are just a couple reasons I could come up with.  

For those who agree with ice cores, why is there a discrepancy between the supposed 110,000-700,000 years of ice layers and the billions of years age of the earth? Each theory requires even more and more theories in order for it to work. 

Annual layers also become harder to see deeper in the ice core and researchers have to resort to even more uncertain and fallible methods of measurement like geochemisty, layers of ash (tephra), electrical conductivity, and using numerical flow models to understand age-depth relationships. http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-cores/ice-core-basics/

Perry Marshall presents a lot of alleged evidence for some of these claims in his book *Evolution 2.0* which is pretty accessible for laymen and includes lots of resources to learn more. He basically sees it all as a sort of intelligently-designed evolution that is evidence of an awesome creator, though he tends to assume it can explain more than it currently can but that further research will continue to explain more.

At risk of oversimplification, I see neo-Darwinism / random mutation and natural selection as saying ""Here's a short story, if you keep changing or rearranging random letters for a long enough time you'll eventually get a completely different awesome complicated novels""

And I see 3rd way / natural genetic engineering / 2.0 as saying, ""ha ha that's ridiculous that could never happen no but really cells are actually smart enough to change and rearrange not letters but words and entire paragraphs and they can tell the difference between nouns and verbs and know some basic rules of grammar and they can even copy some random parts of other stories and figure out how to put those pieces into their story to form sentences that make sense. The random letter mutations do happen but they just kinda add some sparkle every now and then.""

I don't know enough science to properly evaluate it all but from far enough away it basically looks to me like on the one hand it actually provides a potentially plausible mechanism for evolution, supposing there truly is solid evidence for various strains of common ancestry, but on the other hand it requires an evolution that is so intelligent and orderly that it pretty much begs for an intelligent designer to initially set it up. So I think it's interesting to see evolution trending in (IMO) a pro-creator direction, and there seems to be some evidence to back some of these things up (horizontal gene transfer is pretty fascinating and our knowledge of it seems to keep expanding, for one), but again I'm not really qualified to evaluate how good some of this evidence is.",2,1494004930,2017-05-05 13:22:10

The most important thing to realize though is that evidence always has to be interpreted. In the evolution vs. creationism debate for instance, there is no such thing as evidence with big bright letters stating that ""this is a transitional fossil"". There are not creationist fossils and evolutionist fossils, but there are creationist and evolutionist interpretations of the fossils. 

The second most important thing to remember is the Bible is not written as a scientific document using the standards of our own recent methodology (the scientific method). Over history what we have seen are Christian's assumptions of the world that we live in by taking (often times vague) verses from Scripture and interpreting them.

328,"There are quite a few assumptions one must make when using the distant starlight argument for an old earth. 

https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/starlight/does-distant-starlight-prove-the-universe-is-old/

Historical science basically rests on many axiomatic principles that require faith to believe in.

It is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as light speed have the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time (also known as the variable speed of light (VSL) theory). This is one answer to the [Horizon problem](http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/HorizonProblem.html) that arises when we assume the speed of light is constant. [This article](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/light-speed-slowed) summarizes the problem a bit. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found (mostly because this is very hard to test for), but they remain the subject of ongoing research. It also is generally assumed that the speed of light is isotropic, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured.

Another interesting question is what if the speed of light is effected by the structure/gravity/time dilation of the galaxy we currently reside in? If so, the only accurate measurements we could make of the universe would be outside of the effects of our galaxy in intergalactic space. Because we are making the assumption that things inside our solar system and galaxy also apply to everything else outside of it. After all, at the center of our galaxy is a supermassive black hole that has been theorized to effect the red and blue shift of light depending on if you are inside it's field of effect or outside of it. So we can't really conclusively say that we are certain that the speed of light is constant for everything in the universe unless we make assumptions.",1,1493963649,2017-05-05 01:54:09

Some are, some aren't. It's still mostly a argument from ignorance and a theological argument. Creationists don't deny that things like ostrich wings or blind cavefish eyes are vestigial. Those are loss-of-function organs that no one disputes. 

&gt; tailbone

You are referring to the coccyx, which is a functional anchor for tendons and muscles and help us walk with balance and sit down properly. It's fundamental for us bipeds. This has been known for years. If you look at the medical literature with a quick glance you will see what happens when someone suffers a injury to their tailbone and seeing how important it is.

1. Birds once had teeth

2. Birds lost their teeth

Even in the fossils we find modern-like birds with teeth. This is no surprise.

Basically your DNA will work in certain ways based on how it's ordered. Many things can affect hos it is ordered, it can shrink and it can grow. All this affect life in some way. In many cases it is bad, as you say, but it's not always the case either. 

Correct me if I'm wrong I feel that some people assert that there, for some reason, must be a process that out of nowhere spawn a large amount of genetic information that form a entirely new trait not seen before.

392,"Shapiro uses some slightly misleading terminology there, as it is not ""cognition"" in the common sense, since that is a mental process, but rather advanced computation at the genetic level. Overlooking that, this is truly fascinating stuff. I particularly like this part:

&gt; This incredible precision is accomplished not by rigid mechanical precision but rather by using two layers of expert error monitoring and correction systems: (1) exonuclease proofreading in the polymerase itself, which catches and corrects over 99.9% of all mistakes as soon as they are made (Kunkel &amp; Bebenek, 2000), and (2) the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, which subsequently detects and fixes over 99% of any errors that escaped the exonuclease (Modrich, 1991). Together, this multilayered proofreading system boosts the 99.999% precision of the polymerase to over 99.99999999%. At both stages of the error correction process, detailed molecular analysis has clarified the distinct roles of sensory and repair components. In the case of the MMR system, the sophistication is even more impressive because the molecules discriminate newly replicated from old DNA so that they only correct the newly synthesized strand (Radman &amp; Wagner, 1988).

This is a fabulous argument for design, in my opinion. The systems described are highly effective at error detection and correction, and even usage of genetic information from host organisms. Interestingly, Box 1 lays out the exact kind of Boolean operations I expected. But from what I'm reading, these bacteria never write any truly novel genetic code exceeding their hardwired parameters.

From molecular (not evolutionary) biologist James Shapiro:

&gt;ABSTRACT: 40 years experience as a bacterial geneticist have taught me that bacteria possess many cognitive, computational and evolutionary capabilities unimaginable in the first six decades of the 20th Century. Analysis of cellular processes such as metabolism, regulation of protein synthesis, and DNA repair established that bacteria continually monitor their external and internal environments and compute functional outputs based on information provided by their sensory apparatus. Studies of genetic recombination, lysogeny, antibiotic resistance and my own work on transposable elements revealed multiple widespread bacterial systems for mobilizing and engineering DNA molecules. Examination of colony development and organization led me to appreciate how extensive multicellular collaboration is among the majority of bacterial species. Contemporary research in many laboratories on cell-cell signaling, symbiosis and pathogenesis show that bacteria utilize sophisticated mechanisms for intercellular communication and even have the ability to commandeer the basic cell biology of “higher” plants and animals to meet their own needs.

I can't claim to be an expert on that subject, but when I read about it, it sounds predominantly like the accumulation of genetic damage, not additional useful coding.

&gt; that is clearly an increase in information 

Rather, is that not merely selection and design at work? Are any new kinds of genes actually coded that would allow bacteria to become non-bacteria?

&gt;It's pointless and not very helpful.

I sincerely disagree. ""Information increase"" should imply a very strict technical meaning. When I use the phrase, I'm not talking about selection or gene damage, I'm talking about new, functional coding. Say for instance we start out with a simple program that says,

    if(a,b,c): print(""The world is round."")

Through gene damage and selection we may end up with

    if(a,b,): print(""Tje wworld round."")

The program might still operate, though somewhat differently than before, yet we have not added any information. We have only excluded some and warped what was already there a bit.

[283] Finally, there is the difference over the original abode of humankind. Genesis 2 relates that God, after he had created Adam, planted a garden in Eden (2:8). This Aka (delight, land of delight) is therefore not identical with paradise but a region in which the garden (LXX paradeisos) was planted. This paradise is then called ""the garden of Eden"" (Gen. 2:15; 3:23), ""the garden of God"" (Ezek. 31:8-9), ""the garden of the LORD"" (Isa. 51:3), and is sometimes equated with Eden (Isa. 51:3; Ezek. 28:13; 31:9). A river flows from the garden and divides into four heads or branches, which are named Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Phrath. The last two rivers are the Tigris and the Euphrates; but about the first two there has always been disagreement. Some interpreted this allegorically, and most avoided trying to identify the geographic location of paradise until Augustine Steuchus of Gubbio, called Eugubinus (d. 1550), who in his work Kosmopoiia (Lyons, 1535) developed the hypothesis that the four rivers are the estuaries of one vast river, the so-called Tigris-Euphrates, and paradise is therefore situated near the present city of Coma. Roman Catholic and Protestant scholars alike warmly accepted this suggestion. Around the middle of the seventeenth century, another proposal, the so-called Armenia hypothesis, argued that the rivers could be located in a much more northern area, namely, Armenia. By contrast, Friedrich Delitzsch in his work, Wo lag das Paradies? (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1881), looked for the location of paradise in a more southern direction: in the landscape of Babylon. Others treat the account as a saga in which Pishon and Gihon originally denote the Indus and the Oxus J. D. Michaelis, Knobel, Bunsen, Ewald, and others), and still others regard it as a myth in which Havilah represents the golden land of the saga, and the Gihon is the Ganges or the Nile.       

Most anthropologists and linguists no longer take any account of Genesis 2 at all and mention a variety of countries as the original abode of humanity. But they are far from unanimous and have bestowed this honor on practically all countries. For that matter, many scholars assume not just a single original abode of man, but believe that the evolution from animal to man occurred in various parts of the earth, thus combining Darwinism with polygeneticism (e.g., Haeckel and others). These conjectures are an indication of science's inability to speak with certainty here. Ethnology, linguistics, history, and the natural sciences furnish us data that make plausible the choice of Asia as the original abode of man and that choice comports perfectly with biblical teaching. In Asia we find the most ancient peoples, the most ancient civilization, the most ancient languages; all of ancient history points us to this continent. From within this part of the earth Europe, Africa, Australia, and also America have been populated. Granted, in this connection many questions arise to which we do not yet know the answers. But this ignorance does not give us reason to overthrow the teaching of Scripture that Asia is the cradle of humanity. About the location of paradise and Eden, the different opinions suggest that the precise geography may no longer lie within our capacity to determine, but Scripture and science unite in the witness that it is in Asia that we must look for the original abode of man. 
",1,1493793355,2017-05-03 02:35:55
397,"Text 2:

[281] The theory of evolution also clashes with Scripture on questions about the age, the unity, and the original abode of humanity. Many peoples of the world attribute great age to humanity; some speak of multiple world ages and of myriads and hundreds of thousands of years. Modem anthropology reintroduces these fabulous figures without much consistency; these numbers range between 10,000 and 500,000 years and even more. Taking the theory of evolution seriously, calculations about how long it would take for the human eye to develop from a tiny spot of pigment and for the brains of mammals to develop from an original ganglion, and then multiplying these figures to account for all life on earth, the estimates become truly fantastic. Darwin himself in the first edition of his Origin of Species came to a figure of 300 million years for the age of life on earth, and others used even higher figures. More recent figures narrow the range from 10 million to 100 million years—an uncertain figure subject to modification at a moment's notice—and thus place the origin of life and of humanity much closer. Calculations based on geology are hypothetical and far from being certain. The data do not settle the matter.     

We do, however, have some chronological data furnished by the history and monuments of different peoples, notably Egypt and Babylonia. Here, as Scripture itself teaches, we undoubtedly have ancient civilizations already existing as far as we can go back in history. But the chronology is nevertheless still so uncertain that one cannot base much on it. It is a labyrinth without a thread to guide the inquirer. Only in the case of the people of Israel can we actually speak of a history and a chronology. The chronology for the first thousand years before Christ is fairly well established, sometimes down to the details; in the second thousand years before Christ we seem to have been given only a few fixed reference points; and in the third thousand years, that is, before 2000 BC, everything is uncertain. We are thus led to a time that is not much beyond five thousand to seven thousand years before Christ, though we need to recognize that scholars are far from having reached agreement about the chronology of the Bible. 

[282] There can be no doubt that Scripture teaches the unity of the human race (Gen. 1:26; 6:3; 7:21; 10:32; Matt. 19:4; Acts 17:26; Rom. 5:12ff.; 1 Cor. 15:21f., 45f.). Except for the Stoa which taught that all human beings formed one single inclusive body (systepma politikon) and hence proclaimed universal justice and love, this doctrine has almost never been acknowledged by those outside the circle of revelation. The Greeks proudly looked down on ""barbarians,"" and the peoples of India created four castes of people, each of whom had a distinct origin. Following the Renaissance the idea of various origins of the human race again surfaced in the form of true polygeneticism, or coadamitism, that is, the descent of different races from different ancestors, or as preadamitism, that is, the descent of savage dark-skinned peoples from an ancestor before Adam, while Adam was considered the ancestor of the Jews or also of white humanity. The notion of multiple origins became more plausible when in the eighteenth century knowledge of the peoples of the world gained currency and people began to realize the great diversity in color, hair, build, customs, etc. After 1860, Darwinism was added to these views, and many of its adherents became polygenetic even though the theory of variability in it could very well be used to defend monogeneticism. Darwinism cannot settle the question concerning the origin and age of humanity; the transition from animal to man occurred so slowly that there really was no first man.     

Now the existence of various peoples and races within humanity is most certainly an important issue, whose solution we are not even close to finding. The differences in color, hair, skull, language, ideas, religion, mores, customs, and so on are so great and the expansion of the one human race over the globe—for example, to the South Sea islands and America—so unknown that the idea of the different origins of peoples can hardly surprise us. What Scripture teaches is that a single act of God in which he intervened in the development of humanity (Gen. 11) led to this variation. Most importantly, this scattering and diversification has a deep religious-ethical meaning. Isolation and intensification of language differences lead to intellectual and spiritual decline. The confusion of languages is the result of confusion in ideas, in the mind, and in life. Even then, with all that division and brokenness, unity has been preserved. As our knowledge of linguistics improves we increasingly find kinship and unity of origin in languages that in the past were not even remotely suspected of any; absolute classification remains elusive. Genesis 10, accordingly, maintains the unity of the race in the face of all diversity, and Johann von Muller with good reason said, All history must start with this chapter.""      

Here Darwinism cannot raise objections against a common origin and even furnishes a conceptual framework for explaining the possibility of a wide assortment of changes within a given species as a result of various external influences. However great the difference between the races may be, the deeper unity and kinship is obvious. People of the most diverse races can mate and produce fertile children, share physiological and social attributes and practices, and have many intellectual, religious, moral, social, and political dimensions in common. The unity of the human race, as Scripture teaches, is powerfully confirmed by all this. This affirmation of unity is not a matter of indifference but of the utmost importance: it is the presupposition of religion and morality. The solidarity of the human race, original sin, the atonement in Christ, the universality of the kingdom of God, the catholicity of the church, and the love of neighbor—these all are grounded in the unity of humankind.

398,"TEXT 1:

HUMAN ORIGINS 

[279] Humanity, where the spiritual and material world are joined together, is the crowning culmination of creation. Created on the sixth day (Gen. 1:26ff.), following the creation of the land animals, human beings, male and female, share a kinship with animals.     

There is also a major difference: animals were brought forth by the earth at God's command (Gen. 1:24); humanity, however, was created, after divine deliberation, in God's image, to be master over all things. This is confirmed by the two creation accounts in Genesis 1 and 2: chapter 1 offers a general history of creation, which has its goal and end in humanity; chapter 2 deals especially with the human creation and the relation of humans to other creatures. In the first report humanity is the crown of creation; in the second the beginning of history. Genesis 1 provides a more detailed report of creation in general and treats the creation of humanity succinctly; Genesis 2 presupposes the creation of heaven and earth, follows a topical order, and describes relationships of humans to other creatures. Genesis 2:4b-9 does not imply that the plants were formed after humans, but only that the Garden of Eden was planted after that event. 

Similarly, in Genesis 2:18ff., the intention is not to describe the objective course of creational events but only to show that a helper for man was not to be found among the animals and required a being like himself. The account of the creation of the woman does not conflict with that in Genesis 1 but is a further explication of it.    
 
This divine origin of humankind has never been questioned in the Christian church and in Christian theology. But outside special revelation we find all sorts of conjectures like those of pagan sagas that attribute human creation to the gods or the demigods. Others regard human beings as having emerged autochthonously from the earth, or evolved from some other animal, or as the fruit of some tree, and so forth. Of the many alternative conjectures about human origins that have been ventured outside of scriptural revelation, the hypothesis of Darwinian evolutionism through natural selection is dominant in our world. The Christian objection here is not to the idea of development as such, which goes back to Greek philosophy, but to the naturalism and materialism of the Darwinian hypothesis. Darwin's claim to fame is that he not only made numerous observations underscoring the kinship between humans and animals, but that he made them serviceable to a hypothesis that humans had descended from animal ancestors. Darwin's thesis, or rather, hypothesis, is this: species have no constant properties but are mutable; all higher organic beings including man have evolved from lower ones, from the higher apes; all organic matter, in turn, emerged from the inorganic under the sway of purely mechanical and chemical laws. The evolutionary mechanism by which this is accomplished is called ""natural selection,"" the process by which nature selects the most fit species for survival and reproduction. None of this, of course, can be proved; instead we see assumptions and conjectures on the basis of kinship between organisms, the possibility of mutation and subsequent transmission of properties, and from embryology and the paleontological record. 

[280] This theory has been seriously opposed, not only by Bible-believers but also by natural scientists and philosophers more broadly. At the end of the nineteenth century the intellectual life of people underwent a remarkable change. Although an array of brilliant results had been achieved in the natural sciences, in culture, and in technology, the human heart had been left unsatisfied, and so people turned from intellectualism to mysticism, from exact science to philosophy, from mechanicism to dynamism, from dead matter to the vital force, from atheism back to pantheism. Monistic thought came to acknowledge that even materialism with its matter and force had not overcome dualism, and philosophical idealism yielded the insight that matter and all of nature are only given us in the form of an idea. As naturalism and materialism demonstrated spiritual bankruptcy, this new mystical and even pantheistic spirituality further discredited Darwinism. The critique of Darwinism includes at least the following four elements.     

In the first place, the theory of descent has proved completely unable adequately to explain the origin of life. The explanation that an accidental combination of inorganic materials could produce organic entities (generatio aequivoca; ""ambiguous generation"") was proved untenable by Pasteur; subsequent explanations that ""life seeds"" (germs or protoplasm) had come from other planets by way of meteorites (Helmholtz, Thomson), or that life cells were eternal, all fail to satisfy the mind or heart and demonstrate a kind of desperation. Consequently, many natural scientists have therefore returned to vitalism. Second, Darwinism is incapable of explaining the further development of organic entities. Whereas Scripture teaches that the essential diversity and dissimilarity of creatures is rooted in God's creative omnipotence, in Darwinism this diversity and dissimilarity of creatures, specifically of organic entities, remains a riddle. It is increasingly recognized that this diversity cannot be inferred from one single organism or even from four or five original organisms. Both morphologically and physiologically the species are much too divergent. Transitions from one species into the other have never been observed, and natural and sexual selection are insufficient to make them possible, also because it is not sure that acquired traits are transmitted by heredity. Totally contrary to Darwin's theory, morphological properties are the most variable. If morphological changes proceed at a slow rate and were each time of little significance, they would be more of a handicap than an advantage in times of transition. For as long as breathing through gills changed into breathing by lungs, the process was more a hindrance than an advantage in the struggle for existence. For all these reasons, natural scientists would do well to refrain from making judgments too quickly and dogmatically. Darwinism is both historically and logically the result of philosophy, not of experimental science. Darwin himself even acknowledged that many of the views he presented were highly speculative.    

Darwinism is particularly problematic on the question of human origins. It has not provided conclusive positive proof of human descent from animal ancestry. Arguments from ontogeny or the fossil record of human bones and skulls all flounder in the absence of transitional forms. There is an essential difference between humans and animals. Even more devastating is the failure of Darwinism to account for the psychic dimension of our humanity. Attempts to derive all human mental phenomena (consciousness, language, religion, morality, etc.) from those of animals have not been successful. Like the origin of movement, the origination of life, and teleology, so also human consciousness, language, freedom of the will, religion, and morality still belong to the enigmas of the world awaiting resolution. The relation of the mind to our brain is quite unlike that of bile to the liver or urine to the kidneys. In the words of Max Muller, language is and remains the Rubicon between us and the animal world. The psychological explanation of religion is untenable and the derivation of morality from human social instincts alone fails to account for the imperatives of the good, for conscience, responsibility, the sense of sin, repentance, remorse, and punishment. Darwinism thus tends toward materialism, finds there its most significant support, and hence subverts religion and morality and destroys our humanness. If we are not fallen and human image bearers of God but only highly developed animals we are degraded as responsible, religious, moral beings. From the standpoint of evolution, humanity as the image of God cannot be maintained. The theory of evolution forces us to return to creation as Scripture presents it to us.

399,"&gt;  so how can you say any information or learning is ever achieved?

Transgenerational epigenetic marks for example.  

Also when bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance through plasmid exchange, that is clearly an increase in information that seems to be intelligently designed capability.  Granted this may not qualify as mutation, but I've suggested creationists drop the ""no information increase"" argument.   It's pointless and not very helpful.

James Shapiro points out how bacteria and plants re engineer their own genomes, so this could be argued mutation leading to information increase.

But I pose the question, ""why go there?""  Why make sweeping generalizations that are hard to defend without examining every creature on the planet? 

There are arguments out there that more defensible, imho, than ""there is no increase in information ever"".

417,"I was contradicting the insinuation that the origin of a copying system as complex as to involve Okazaki fragment processing is within ordinary expectation.

In math we can sometimes express how far outside ordinary expectation an event is by estimating how many standard deviations from expectations an event is.

If there is no threshold for the number of standard deviations from expectation that would at least make you suspect a miracle was in play, then, even if a miracle happened, in principle you would never be able to recognize it as such since you could always persuade yourself there is a chance there is an explanation that doesn't involve God or some Designer.   That's the Richard Dawkins solution where he said even if God appeared to him, he would assume it was a hallucination.

I've said there is no way to formally prove Design or God or what ever, but some ideas seem more believable than others.  I don't find Okazaki fragment processing to be the product of many ordinary events over billions of years.  From experience it seems to me time destroys designs, it doesn't evolve them unless there is a driving intelligence.

Sure, leaves are involved. More leaves, more taken out of the environment.

Just not as much as cutting down the trees, replacing them with other trees with pretty much the same amount of leaves in the long term, then sending those logs somewhere to become a sailboat. Then you have a forest and a sailboat. That sailboat, that's the carbon sequestration. Forests without people, they don't make sailboats. They just stay forests. You get more wood, and more sequestration, when we cut down and replant forests, which is why commercial numbers, such as how much wood we can harvest from a plot of forests, are not going to represent natural numbers.

You'll certainly disagree with all this, but an area of ID research interesting to me is design detection.  In a broader sense this is used in forensics, archaeology, and even SETI to determine what artifacts / messages are from an intelligent origin and which are natural occurrences.  Specifically in the evolution debate I think it can be useful to determine what features in living things are evolved versus those that cannot evolve but instead match patterns we find among our own designed objects.  

I mentioned one such pattern [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/683cjh/ever_hear_an_evolutionist_talk_about_the/dgvg9th/) with the distributions of morphology in animals.  In [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/3m1dv1/how_to_you_rationalize_evidence_that_conflicts/cvcu0p2/) I go through three patterns in genomes that fit design but are the opposite of what we'd expect from an evolutionary process.

It could be that a creature is made of other chemicals. The issue is how far the system is from ordinary expectation given the ancestral precursors if there are any.

460,"Uh...no. You really oversimplify these things.

This figure is the amount of wood extracted from the forest, not the volume of the forest. If we left the wood in the forest, the growth rate goes down dramatically: we are removing trees, which means there's more room for more trees to harvest later. That's how we get the rate higher: we harvest and propagate the tree beyond the natural cycle. 

As you mentioned, we're removing the trees much faster than the natural rate as young growth sequoia is better for our purposes. In a long growth forest, you wouldn't expect the wood turnover to be anywhere near this rate.

If a sequoia lives for 1000 years, then each mature tree that survives instead of being harvested eliminates 29 trees from our artificial cycle where such a tree would be cut down. Those 29 trees are a huge proportion of the wood production you're measured as growth.

We're eliminating 75% of the mature population every cycle. The knock-on effect here is huge.

Edit:

To attempt to quantify the effect:

We have a stable population of 100 individuals. We harvest 75% every 30 years, and replant. At the end of 1000 years, we have completed 33 cycles and harvested 2,475 trees, or 24x the trees in the population. No tree is going to be older than two cycles, as we're selecting for age.

We can assume our natural population isn't controlled, so the distribution is going to be wilder: there will be a handful of ancients, and a number of smaller individuals. But the average age is going to be much, much, much higher than our artificial population, and that will be reflected in the growth rate.",2,1493754362,2017-05-02 15:46:02

Right before that table, the heading is tons per hectare, so I thought I was multiplying area by mass per area to get total mass.  But I think you're right and thus  I have messed that calculation up.

I followed the paper to its source [here](http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4095e/w4095e08.htm), which gives tons per hectare of above-ground biomass for different forests around the world.  The densest forest is 860 t/ha.  860 t/ha is 86kg per square meter.  148 trillion square meters times 86kg per square meter gives 1.27x10^16 total kg of above-ground biomass.  Times 25% of the biomass being carbon is 3.18x10^15 kg of carbon.

10 trillion tons of coal is 10^16 kg.  Times coal being 75% carbon is  7.5*10^15kg of carbon.  So that is indeed short.  Although the factors leading to these estimate also have large margins of error:

1.  A pre flood world could have twice or half as much land
2.  Coal estimates could be off by a factor of two or more.
5.  And so could biomass estimates.

And my sequoia-based estimate gave several times more than enough wood to account for the coal.  So it seems difficult to draw a conclusion saying it's possible or impossible.  Please check my math.",1,1493749037,2017-05-02 14:17:17

At 540 kg/m^3 density for sequoia wood, that comes to a maximum total of 8x10^16 kg of wood in a pre-flood world, not counting floating forest models that some YECs assume based on the root structures of fossil trees.

The US has more coal than any other country, even much larger ones like Russia.

10 trillion tons is 9x10^15kg, or about 9 times less than the mass of all our wood.

Here's another calculation:  

Some things to consider:  [This page](http://www.fao.org/3/a-y1997e/y1997e07.htm) (table 2) estimates greater than half a tone of biomass per cubic meter of tropical forests.  The earth has about 148 trillion square meters of land surface area.  Multiplying those together gives about 81 tons of total biomass.

[This site](https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/where-coal-found) lists 892 billion tons of coal worldwide, but that's only proven coal and not a total estimate.

So both calculations give us about 8-9 times more biomass than coal mass.  Assuming I haven't made any math errors.  But some things to consider:

1.  This only counts biomass from wood and not other plants.
2.  Most but not all of the material of coal is organic in origin.
3.  A pre flood world probably wasn't all sequoia or rain forest.
4.  This assumes the pre and post flood worlds had the same area of land above water.
5.  Lots of wood would rot--not all of it becomes buried as coal.

&gt;Since you are familiar with these topics and I'm not, perhaps you could tell me how YEC geologists explain coal, and the problems you see with their explanations?

I honestly don't know how YEC's explain coal, or rather how they explain coal well. 

A lot of our coal deposits come from the Carboniferous. During that time there were a couple important things happening. The oxygen content was nearly double what it is today. And there were not bacteria, or fungi that could digest lignin (aka wood) 

The result of which was the dead trees just kinda hung around, until massive fires (fueled by the high oxygen content) came about every once in a while and burnt everything down allowing new growth. If you can imagine this occurring with some regularity it's pretty easy to see how we get coal deposits that are sometimes hundreds of meters deep, and filled with significant amounts of ash, as high as 20% by weight in some deposits.

If you also consider this took place during the time when Pangea was the only Continent it explains why some coal deposits in Virginia match up with those in western Africa, and Europe.

Estimates for the total biomass of the earth is all over the place -- 1T tons at the highest, ~500B tons at the lowest. There are debates over how much the bacterial mass is, whether it's heavier than the surface life or not, whether we should count bacterial life at all... 1T assumes an equal amount of bacterial biomass, but oceanic surveys didn't turn up nearly as much bacteria as that number suggested.

The geology is consistent with millions of years. Coal deposits don't make sense in a flood world -- there's more coal than there is non-bacteria biomass today, and not by a small margin. There is believed to be 8x as much carbon buried under the US as there is in the non-bacterial biomass today.

That's just too much. 

&gt;Multiplying those together gives a difference of a factor of 1.2 million.

I also only used a biomass of 65kg. One dinosaur is substantially heavier. All the dinosaurs is substantially heavier than one.

This is why we won't find very much, but still find bits and pieces.

&gt;And for the fourth time now: If you had (read all those papers), then why did you think collagen had not been found?

I must have appended this after.

Because it degrades, and we've found it inside tiny crevices of bones we couldn't search before. I'm almost certain we have found fossils containing collagen before, we just never knew it was there to be found and never went looking. I don't expect every fossil to have collagen survive to the modern era and I don't expect things to be easy for us if it does.

I don't understand what you think ""collagen has not been found"" really means. We are capable of not finding things that are right in front of us. We discovered it, we didn't invent it.",2,1493672627,2017-05-01 17:03:47

A one-on-one debate would make it easier to teach creationists here how to debate and engage evolutionists.  I want creationists to be able to take on professors of evolutionary biology.  That is part of what I feel my teaching responsibility is.

Now, I may not care for most of the commenters at r/debateevolution, but I do feel if I can show it is possible to engage and refute a professor of evolutionary biology, then other creationists can hopefully feel strengthened in their beliefs.

499,"&gt; I wouldn't do it either.

It's an anti-scientific attitude to refuse to do a test because it may reveal data that contradicts your worldview.

&gt; If we accept this collagen is young and didn't degrade because of it's age -- why did the rest of the dinosaur?

Because it's not inside the bones.

&gt; When? 50k years ago? 35k years ago? My readings of the Genesis genealogies suggest a date around 6K years for Creation

The conventional carbon-14 curves propose a greater amount of C14 in the atmosphere than there is today.   The YEC's propose the opposite.  If the world were created 6000 years ago with no carbon-14 and increased from there, then all C14 dates would map to within that range.

But I'm not a YEC and if I were I wouldn't be tied to 6000 years.  All I'm saying is we have a bunch of conflicting data and I'm tired of seeing it swept under the rug.

&gt; even accepting 25K as the age for dinosaurs, or the geology -- it's all consistent with millions of years.

Dinosaurs having soft tissue and a carbon-14 age of 25k years is consistent with millions of years?

&gt; The dates don't fit.

To have carbon-14 and soft tissue in the fossil record in layers that often have a mile of sediments above them, you have to have to have a global catastrophe that's likely very wet.

&gt; The coal fields don't make sense

Since you are familiar with these topics and I'm not, perhaps you could tell me how YEC geologists explain coal, and the problems you see with their explanations?

&gt; Allentoft and Bunce estimate that DNA's half-life can be up to 158,000 years, meaning the last remnants would disappear around the 6.8-million-year mark.

You left off the first part of that quote:  ""under sub-zero conditions.""  With an estimated burial temperature of 13 ºC, the DNA's half-life was 521 years – almost 400 times longer than expected from lab experiments at similar temperatures.

1.  Your calculation with 6.8 million years is 10 times too small to be in the age of dinosaurs.
2.  That estimate is 158k/421 = 303 times too small, because you're assuming the bones are frozen, which they're not.
3.  And that in itself is still 400 times slower than the rate we observe it to break down in the lab.

Multiplying those together gives a difference of a factor of 1.2 million.

There's not a single organism with a genome smaller than ~1MB where its environment favors free living self replication?  Minimum complexity isn't my own argument here.

Kauffman advocates self-organization.  But all patterns created by chemistry are repetitive/redundant, so I don't find that idea very compelling.

9,"&gt; However, as you mentioned, Islam shares the same creation story as Christianity and Judaism. Even if you reject Christianity, would you at least agree that this account has more evidence than the other views you listed?

Well, yes and no. At least at my current state of knowledge, I would say Christianity has an edge about attesting the common belief of ""Christians"" at that time about Jesus, one big thing is multiple attestation. IMO it does show that it wasn't just somehow made up by some group of people or something, but was commonly believed. However I think there also stops the evidence. IMO the methods you listed only help to find out whether the author wrote something what was against or within the common belief of the time, not the truth. And common belief is nothing else than opinion, at least in my view.

I mean let's take the UFO sightings as an example. It's comparable to Christianity (or religion in general) in a way. Some people start claiming seeing UFOs. The explainations why they saw it (assuming there are no UFOs, not the literal meaning, but the alien spaceship meaning) can be numerous. Some may have simply made it up, some maybe have mistaken something for an UFO, while others hallucinated. Now, let's go hypothetical and unrealisitical step further and some people start writing down about these sightings, in a similar fashion as the bible authors. As we now have a bunch of texts about it, we could use your methods to work out which texts are the most authentic. However in the end we won't find the truth, but only what the common belief was of the ""UFO seeers"". Hope this somewhat absurd example shows why I think the methods can't show any truths with certainty.

Also, as far as I see it these methods only work on the NT, thus the OT is as credable as any other religious text in my opinion, thus also its creation myth is as credable as any other creation myth. Or are there also methods which can be used as evidence for OT?

&gt; The authorship of some of these books is contested. We can talk about that too if you'd like?

Yes, if it's not too much. I can't remove the feeling that some early authorities couldn't just manipulate the texts so that it better suits the Jesus narrative.

&gt;&gt; Though I don't see how the methods you listed can differentiate between truth and the common belief of the people (living around the author).

&gt; I think having authors as witnesses makes a difference.

It may be the best evidence we have, but how can we trust they aren't unreliable or weren't manipulated in any way by some authorities? I just can't get out of my mind that it can be just constructed.

15,"Yeah, maybe you are right and the explanation we can find in that link has too many problems, but luckily I gave you this link only because I had no time to reply fully.  

My best reason to not take these finding seriously is the one I wrote before, that carbon dating can't give you accurate results if the sample is too old. The reason for this is quite simple, but maybe I am not good explaining it, but still, I try: 

So we know the half-life of C-14. It is 5730 years (actually if you think about it, this would be explanation enough in itself).   
We have a pretty good idea to how much C-14 should we expect from something that is alive, it is one carbon-14 atom for every trillion carbon-12 atoms. It is important to know, that this is an estimated value.  

If we have a sample that contains 1% carbon, and we measure the number of carbon atoms in a milligram we get something like 6\*10^18, this means that we expect 6\*10^6 C-14 in the sample, this is 6000000 C-14 atom. We measure this if the sample is from something that was alive just a minute ago.   


years old | number of atoms
---|---
0 | 6000000 ± 10000
5730 | 3000000 ± 10000
11460 | 1500000 ± 10000
17190 | 750000 ± 10000
22920 | 375000 ± 10000
28650 | 187500 ± 10000
34380 | 93750 ± 10000
40110 | 46875 ± 10000
45840 | 23437 ± 10000
51570 | 11718 ± 10000
57300 | 5859 ± 10000
63030 | 2929 ± 10000
68760 | 1464 ± 10000


The problems are: 

- we estimated the ratio between C-12 and C-14 in living matter, it is not perfectly accurate
- we can't count the number of atoms exactly
- the C-14 / C-12 ratio in the atmosphere is constant, but not exactly the same
- there are two good ways to measure the ratio, but no way yet to measure it accurately

So lets say we examine a sample and we get 3000000 C-14 atom.  
First, we know that this is more like  3000000 ± 10000, because we can't measure it precisely.   
Second, we know that many of our data is estimated and we don't exactly know how many C-14 will be left even after millions of years so we modify our table above to include a ± 10000.
  

We still know that this sample is about 5700 years old, it can be 5500, or 5900 but it doesn't really matter. 

If however we examine a sample and we get 1000 C-14 atom ± 10000. We could say that this is somewhere between ∞ and 50000 years, but we just say this is outside the range of our measurement.   

I said in one of my previous comment, that with a really old sample our accuracy is so bad that we can't do anything with it, but if you see that table above, you can think that I am not right, because if the creationist will get 22000 years old estimate, we can be sure that there were enough C-14 to be measured.  

The problem is, that the above is just an example from my part, and there are many factors, for example, try to calculate the results in the table above if we don't have 1% carbon in our sample, but 0.1%. If we measure 1000 C-14 in this sample, our result will be between 20000 - ∞ and we did nothing but changed one thing.  

Sadly, we can expect problems with the measurement if the scientist is creationist, you can see why if you read the link I provided before (below the ""What exactly are we dating here? Sample contamination and general trustworthyness"" title). 

Another, smaller explanation: look at this [image](http://d2r5da613aq50s.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/167922.image1.jpg) and try to imagine it as a thermometer. If you measure 90% with an accuracy of ± 5%, the number of half-lives will still be pretty accurate, but if you measure 5% with the same accuracy, the result is unusable. 


Sorry for the wall of text, I just thought the description of carbon dating in this way will be useful, because interestingly I didn't find any similar example.  

TLDR: This is like trying to weigh trucks and elephants using bathroom scales, watching the springs go flying, recording the diverse weighs yielded, and declaring that the scales must be defective.

17,"&gt;It's certainly far simpler than any free living cells. Today I could write a self replicating program in just 1-2 very simple lines of code. But computer algorithms are a much more constrained environment than the real world, so I don't think we can reasonably draw parallels. To get closer we would first have to replicate both the hardware and the software, and have it replicate itself using only sunlight, water, and a pile of dirt.

Well, no. Von Neumann's machine is not a computer program it's an abstract machine.

At around 13 minutes in [one of their talks](http://youtu.be/QbdH3l1UjPQ) at a geology conference, they say that AMS and beta-decay methods are in agreement, C14 concentrations decrease with distance from the fossils, and the C13 concentrations in the triceratops match expected values for an animal that consumes C3 carbon fixation system plants (those in temperate environments).

This seems to argue against contamination.  AMS and beta decay being in agreement mean that independent measurements using different techniques give the same result.

&gt; but we have to compensate for background radiation and for potassium decay and probably there are many other factor I don't know about.

Potassium?  It emits an electron when it decays.  That won't create any new C14 like Uranium or Thorium decay will.  Or maybe you are talking about something different and I'm not following?

Have you never seen the trick with the old cameras where a guy stands at the left side of the group while it scans, then runs over to the right side of the group?  No photoshop necessary and the guy shows up on both ends of the line because the camera scans so slowly.  My 8th grade class's teachers did it, so they show up on both sides of the ~100 students in the class pictures.  It is very similar to that, except you have much longer than just 15-30 seconds between hitting those parts of the image.  Usually 5+ minutes, so the clouds move and can get scanned again.  For the one I linked, it doesn't even do continuous scans, but intelligent pointing, so you would expect the image to be pieced together somewhat randomly over an extended time period.  Clouds move, do you expect them to stay still for 60+ minutes?

&gt;Also, is the size variation of North America in these earth ""photos"" ""totally normal for that type of instrument""?

Absolutely not (for a single geostationary instrument, that would be a LOT of parallax distortion), but those are either not from the same instrument, or the orbit was adjusted, which does happen occasionally as satellites/instruments reach end of life or the mission changes.  I would need to see which mission(s) those images came from.  I strongly suspect they are not from the same instrument, which means they are taken from very different points.

One image is pretty clearly in a high orbit (and probably north of the equator) over the eastern US. (The right image)

The other is in a low orbit (probably centered somewhere south of the equator) of the western US.

It is kind of like how if you put your head close to something, tilt away so that your right eye is really close to it, but your left eye is farther away, then look out of only one eye at a time.  Your eyes see really different images in terms of size + angle.

Or for another example.  Two different pictures of the same thing set to the same image size.

43,"&gt; NASA has been caught using photoshop to stitch together images. A NASA artist even admits it

Hey, guy who has worked on the instruments that make those images here.

There is a misconception that taking a picture of the Earth is like taking a picture with your camera, where you go ""snap"" and take a shot of the whole thing.  This is definitely not the case.  If you did that, you would have really bad resolution, not usable for anything you might want to do, like predict weather.  Imagine you want to read license plates on all the cars parked in a stadium parking lot and deliver this as a single big picture.  If you zoom the camera out far enough to see all the cars, you can't read the plates.  If you zoom the camera in far enough to read a plate, you can only see 1 car.  So as a compromise, you use a video recorder instead of a camera, zoom way in, then do a slow sweep across each row of the parking lot.  Then you use photoshop to turn that into a single picture.

Now imagine cars are constantly changing spots in the parking lot.  You'll probably have the same car in your picture multiple times...

The data that comes from the weather/imagery satellites (technically the payload instruments, the satelite is just a vehicle) comes down in swaths, like the sweeps of the parking lot.  A swath is a left to right (theoretically could be right to left, but they never are on existing instruments) scan of the disk (disk being a term for the 2d image of the 3d spherical Earth).  The data analysis then ""stitches"" these swaths back together to make a full image of the Earth, like you assembling the whole parking lot in photoshop.  Stitching is not some magical hoax, it is the industry accepted name of the process of taking multiple small pictures and turning them into a big one.  It comes from how you stitch a blanket or clothing, because you are taking multiple pieces to make a continuous whole, arranging them north to south, and matching up the pixels in the bottom of the northern piece with the top of the southern piece to get the best alignement.

The scanning process takes time, especially on the older instruments.  So each swath, beginning to beginning, might be 5 minutes.  Because of this time difference, clouds move (they move really fast, sometimes) and your spacecraft's orbital position can adjust slightly too.  Because of this disparity, you have to match the pixels up and ""stitch"" the image.

[See conspiracy site here](https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/10/06/nasas-blue-marble-earth-is-a-fake/)  You can see where they have shown clouds that appear multiple times.  This is totally normal for that type of instrument.  Notice the cloud is always shifted from north to south and west to east.  This is because of the way those instruments scan, and if the conspiracy theorists had spent any time researching how the instruments scan the earth, they would know this is normal.  In fact, the language they use makes it seem like the image is not even captured in swaths, but intelligently chooses where to point and capture next based on where clouds are, so you get the most pictures of the land without clouds in the way.

To go back to my parking lot photo metaphor, its like people keep walking in front of your camera, so when you make the full lot photo in photoshop, you always choose an image without a person blocking you. (except this discrimination happens in taking the photos, not in stitching them.",6,1490729953,2017-03-28 15:39:13

This was response to my reporting of Nobel Prize winner Hermann Muller's work on mutational load where I reported:
http://www.uncommondescent.com/darwinism/darwins-delusion-vs-death-of-the-fittest/

&gt; will suggest two refinements which will show that even with moderate rates of mutation per individual per generation, genetic deterioration will happen. Further, this claim is reinforced by the work of Nobel Prize winner Hermann Muller who said a deleterious mutation rate of even 0.5 per individual per generation would be sufficient to eventually terminate humanity. So the simple model I present is actually more generous than Muller’s. Current estimates of the number of bad mutations are well over 1.0 per human per individual. There could be hundreds, perhaps thousands of bad mutations per individual per generation according to John Sanford. Larry Moran estimates 56-160 mutations per individual per generation. Using Larry’s low figure of 56 and generously granting that only about 11% of those are bad, we end up with 6 bad mutation per individual per generation, 6 times more than the cartoon model presented, and 12 times more than Muller’s figure that ensures the eventual end of the human race.

In response, Dzugavili attempts a rebuttal by saying:

45,"From RH Brown's paper, it may look superficially a dating method that has a range that returns:

&gt;between fossil ages 3000 and 2,000,000 years

is unusable.  It would be an unusable range if one were trying to establish dates between 3,000 and 2,000,000 years.  But it would be useful to establish something isn't 40,000,000 years old.

So why the wide variance in ranges?  Temperature!  If temperature is assumed cold, one gets a 2,000,000 year date, if hot, a 3,000 year date.  But lets look at the requirement for a 2,000,000 year date:

&gt;Using 7ºC as a mean annual temperature for modern times, Equation (5) specifies an effective average storage temperature of -19ºC for a 160-fold reduction. Due to the exponential dependency of racemization rate on temperature, the mean temperature during a large portion of the storage time would have to be lower than -19ºC to establish a -19ºC effective average between +7ºC and the beginning of storage. For 17ºC, rather than 7ºC, as a mean annual modern temperature, the corresponding effective average storage temperature would be -11ºC. These simplified estimates fully establish that the pattern of figures (3) and (4) cannot be explained on the basis of lower temperature on land and on the ocean floor in the past (Miller and Hare 1980, p. 431). 

So to get a 2,000,000 year date, one has to assume the creature was living in an ocean that got frozen!  If the fossil was in warm climates, this is untenable.  But even assuming the fossil was at well below freezing for 2 million years, then 40,000,000 years is still likely untenable.

So, let's suppose the question of fossil age is open.  Is it worth betting one's soul on Charles Darwin and the paleontologists are right?  There is no salvation in Charles Darwin and paleontology.  A Christian can believe in evolution, but an atheist is wagering his soul that evolution is most definitely right, because otherwise that means there might be a Creator he might be accountable to.

&gt;Jesus, /u/stcordova is an idiot.

&gt;On the basis of the D/L ratio for the total shell, from Figure 4 this shell could be assigned an age anywhere in the range between about 30,000 years and about 2,000,000 years.

&gt;I mean, holy fuck. That's quite the range, isn't it? 30,000 to 2m years, based on this dating method?

&gt;That's fuck awful. From the appearance of things, protein dating doesn't seem accurate beyond a minor window and seems entirely superceded by radio-isotope methods.


Suppose the measured range of amino dates is 30,000 to 2,000,000 years, it means it can't be 40,000,000 years or 400,000,000 years.  So the imprecision is moot when even the most extreme possible value of age is still 20 to 200 times below what it should be.

As I already quoted form RH Brown:
&gt;All amino acids from the organic material that produced the oil in this shale should have become racemic long before the 40-60 million years specified by the Eocene age of this formation. 

So what if the date range might be from 3,000 to 2,000,000 years, it's not 40,000,000 years.  And that's enough to reconsider paleontological dates.  If he fossil is at most 2,000,000 old, but the paleontologists say it should be 40,000,000, then the paleontologists are off by 38,000,000 years.  That's a heck of a lot better than being off by at most 2,000,000 years!  

As I pointed out, amino acid racemization dating is inaccurate to establish what time the creature died, but it is plenty accurate to establish a range of when it cannot have died.

Suppose we are trying to establish the time of death of a corpse using amino acid dating, like say amino acid dating the teeth.  Well, amino acid dating is too inaccurate to give the hour and minute the guy died, but we can be assured the corpse isn't 10 million years old.  Amino acid racemization dating is inaccurate to establish what time the creature died, but it is plenty accurate to establish that it can't be older than 50 million years!

&gt;...In response, Bada explains that as long as the samples have not been contaminated by amino acids of recent origin, the relative racemization pattern should follow the order aspartate&gt;alanine&gt;leucine. “That is what makes the race mization studies so unique,” he says. “Deviations from the expected relative racemization pattern are a sure sign of the presence of contamination

There is a problem invoking the contamination argument that involves the compounding interest paradox.  What applies to C14 applies to homochirality contamination.

In doing this you'll realize the amazing consistency of scripture.  A simple example from the evidence you provided... you mentioned Revelation 6:13 saying stars will fall from the sky... the Greek word ""aster"" not only refers to celestial stars, its also used to refer to symbolic stars and also to false teachers and Jesus himself (the morning star).  Our modern word ""asteroid"" comes from the Greek asteroeides.  

I can't find ""asteroeides"" anywhere in the Strong's concordance.  This implies to me the word doesn't exist in the bible and that means it possibly wasn't in use at the time of its writing.

The problem is, that if we measure something really old and we subtract the background radiation, what c-14 we have left is less than the margin of error.  

Your 22000 years old example is not accurately measured, if we measure it multiple times, we can see how unusable the results are, because maybe the same sample will dates to 6000 years and the next 43000 years, etc... We can know that we can't measure this accurately, but creationist will still cherrypick one result.

So my point is, that we don't measure these as you think, we don't get accurate values in the 0-50000 years range and everything older than that 50000+. 
Instead we get more more inaccurate result the older the sample is and the result will be so inaccurate with a really old sample, that we can't do anything with it.  

You think of this like a mercury thermometer which will show the highest temperature it can measure even if the temperature is much higher, but you should think of it like a digital thermometer which will show error-03 or something like this if you measure something too hot.

76,"&gt; The best we can hope for is some small tissue sample that is still soft from exceptionally well preserved fossils

Based on the study with 6 out of 8 bones I think we can say soft tissue is common.  I don't know how often it is for it to be blood red or smell like rotting flesh, but that happens sometimes too.  [Here](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7285683/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/scientists-recover-t-rex-soft-tissue/) you can see some that are red.  On the smell, this is from [an interview with Mary Schweitzer](http://discovermagazine.com/2006/apr/dinosaur-dna):

1.  ""Once, when she was working with a T. rex skeleton harvested from Hell Creek, she noticed that the fossil exuded a distinctly organic odor. ""It smelled just like one of the cadavers we had in the lab who had been treated with chemotherapy before he died,"" she says. Given the conventional wisdom that such fossils were made up entirely of minerals, Schweitzer was anxious when mentioning this to Horner. ""But he said, 'Oh, yeah, all Hell Creek bones smell,'"" she says.""

&gt; The oldest dates that can be reliably measured with carbon-14 are 50000 years, I don't see why would this be erroneous

Because we get dates as young as 22,000 years old.  The coral analogy would only account for this if the date was 50,000 years old.

I would also argue is probably still somewhat higher than 50k, but 50k is fine for this argument.  So if you get an age younger than 50k you've got a few options:

1.  The bone was contaminated with modern carbon sometime in the last several thousand years.  Perhaps from bacteria or something else?

2.  The bone was contaminated due to poor handling by researchers.

3.  The bone was surrounded by very high density uranium or thorium in the ground, which produced new C14 through neutron capture.  But I don't think the needed concentrations exist in nature.

4.  It actually is younger than 50k.

Allow me an analogue:

We see the structure of the ship and we know that ships like this built in 1900-1920. We find some small part of the ship that we know are made with a method that is about a hundred years old. We find many other things that we can date to be around hundred years, but you find a date and time wall clock which stopped working at january 13, so you say this ship is only a few months old.

However, as you mentioned, Islam shares the same creation story as Christianity and Judaism.  Even if you reject Christianity, would you at least agree that this account has more evidence than the other views you listed?

&gt; I infer by your posts, that except Paul no biblical author ever met Jesus.

Among new testament authors, I think that Matthew, John, Peter, James, and probably Jude also met Jesus.  Those first four were Jesus's disciples.  James and likely Jude were Jesus's brothers.

I also think the large majority of the new testament was written before the destruction of the temple in 70AD, including the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and also Acts.  Apart from some vague prophecies by Jesus of the temple being destroyed, this event is never mentioned in the NT.  Even though it would have huge theological influence.  Which makes me think the NT was largely written before this event.

Luke is the author of Acts, but he stops before the death of Paul in the mid 60's.  Luke's gospel was written before Acts, which places it before then as well.  Paul, who traveled with Luke, also quotes parts of Luke's gospel, which would also have it being written before his death.  Or I guess you could argue that he and Luke are actually quoting from a common source.

At the beginning of Luke's gospel he mentions that others had already written accounts of the life of Jesus before he did.  His gospel also has many similarities with Matthew and Mark, suggesting those parts were borrowed.  So I think it makes sense to put Matthew and Mark before Luke.

James and Peter were also killed in the 60's, which put their works before then as well.

I know less about the dating of John's books, but most scholars--even conservative ones--put them after 70AD, often around 90-95AD.  So I'm fine with that date as well.

The authorship of some of these books is contested.  We can talk about that too if you'd like?

&gt; Though I don't see how the methods you listed can differentiate between truth and the common belief of the people (living around the author).

I think having authors as witnesses makes a difference.

If you can point me to something showing otherwise then I'll certainly take an honest look.

I think my biggest hang-up with this being evidence for Young Earth, while it definitely seems compelling, is that saying that soft tissue can last thousands of years but not millions of years by definition requires extrapolations, just like radioactive dating, and therefore the position requires believing that scientists are *wrong* in their extrapolative assumptions about the reliability of radioactive dating, because they don't fully understand it, while *simultaneously* believing scientists were *right* in their extrapolative assumptions about how long soft tissue could last, even though they don't fully understand that, either.",4,1490579752,2017-03-26 21:55:52

Even though they've separated sauropods and theropods, they still have have carnivorous herrreresaurs with the sauropods, but Eoraptor (with both carnivorous and herbivorous teeth) is on the theropod side, which means they essentially now have problems of either carnivores descending from herbivores or vice versa on *two* branches now. 

It's also amazing to see that chart show how narrow a band of time contains almost *all* of the branching into the major dinosaur groups, like a dinosaurian version of the Cambrian explosion, which to me seems to suggest that either the lines were actually all created separately around that time (given the old earth timeline) or that they conveniently diversified not gradually but very quickly, likely using intelligently designed ""Evolution 2.0"" mechanisms...

I haven't read the op's link, but it's common for dinosaur bones to have the features I described.  For example [this study](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8352) found preserved proteins in six out of eight bones, none of which showed any external signs of preservation:

1.  ""we examined eight dinosaur bones from the Cretaceous period, none of which are exceptionally preserved... putative soft tissue (either erythrocyte-like structures, collagen-like, fibrous structures or amorphous carbon-rich structures was observed in six of our eight dinosaur specimens.  Incredibly, none of the samples showed external indicators of exceptional preservation and this strongly suggests that the preservation of soft tissues and even proteins is a more common phenomenon than previously accepted...  Detection of fragments of the amino acids normally found in collagen supports the results obtained from TEM analysis where the ∼67 nm banding is consistent with potential preservation of the original quaternary structure of the protein.""

So  the preservation is better than I remembered:  The quaternary structure is preserved, not just tertiary.  The charcoalized fragment you shared is of no relevance here.

&gt; if this is your only argument, I am good

Young age creationists have also carbon-14 dated about a dozen or so dinosaur bones to 22-39 thousand years old.  That is two lines of evidence the bones themselves are young, while the other techniques rely on dating the surrounding rocks.  Are the young age creationists correct?  I don't know.  But I do think this is worth a serious look.

I often see the ""carbon 14 dating only works on samples younger than 50ka"" argument, but I am hoping you agree it is erroneous?  If not we can go through the reasons.

90,"&gt; People and people groups gradually change their worldviews all the time. Sometimes because their parents do, or because of who they marry. Paul's case is different though. He was a pharisee trained in the Jewish law. On a trip to kill Christians when he claimed to encounter the resurrected Jesus, and because of this he became Christianity's most outspoken evangelist.

Yes, but you gave the impression that you believe the main reason people became Muslim is because they were subjugated. Objectively speaking, Islam converted more regions without subjugation than Christianity. From the top of my head, the only people which converted to Christianity which lived outside of the former borders of the Roman Empire without more or less any subjugation are the Slavic people and in a some ways the Germanic people. All others were more or less converted by ""crusades"". For example the Balkan people were converted AFAIK by crusades. Also most of the African people as well as the people of South and North America converted because of colonialism, thus subjugation. Though as defence Christianity/Europe didn't border as much regions and people as the Islam, so it naturally had less chances to convert others. 

It doesn't say anything about the truth of any religion, but I'm just telling that, as I often here the common theme that Islam was only spread by war and terror (speak: subjugation). Though it is true that the Islam around the Mediterranean was spread by more or less war and terror (speak: subjugation), but there are also regions which converted to Islam peacefully just by contact with it and, at least in my layman general history knowledge, far more frequent than in Christianity's case. I'm not a Muslim, but I find it unfair that most people believe that Islam was mostly spread by subjugation, and Christianity wasn't.

&gt; I don't know a single word of Arabic. But I know Muslim critic David Wood has criticized the Quran saying it's full of broken Arabic which makes it difficult to interpret.

I looked at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rigMARKrNDw) video. So first of, just personally, I don't like his tone. It's this antogonizing tone that many one-sided news speaker (?) have which are also prone to use strawman arguments, in my experience. 

Secondly, he claims or better said quotes Gerd Puin who claims that the Qur'an is incomprehensible, even though Muslims claim it otherwise. So I don't know any Q. Arabic and I never read the Quran, but this statement makes me question his claim. So basically he is saying even though most Muslim, Arab Muslims I suppose, don't have porblems with understanding/interpreting it, he claims the Qur'an is mostly incomprehensible. That's very questionable IMO. It's similar to claiming the Bible contains many evil/immoral things, though Christians claim it otherwise.

Then, he claims that Muslims rather don't to have the Quran translated, because the already broken Q. Arabic is intranslatable. The reason I heard the most, from Muslim friends and the internet, why they always prefer the original Quran is that Muslims want to preserve the Word of God as well as possible. Though I was under the impression that the original Q. Arabic was only highly adviced, not required. And translating from any language to any other language loses always some information and the more different the cultures of the language's speakers are the more drastic the lost. 

Some reasons of the top of my head. One reason is that Quran can be considered poetry, as it is written in [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_\(poetry\)), simimal to how Ancient Greeks and Romans did it. The usual dilemma in translating poetry is whether the meaning or the ""feel"" should be prioritized. So when going for the meaning in the Quran, the ""feel"" will be marginized. 

Then there is the issue of word polysemy/ambiguity, that is a word has several more or less related concept. Almost all words are aculture specific, so even though one could say there is a one to one translation for certain words, there will be always slight nuances. For the lack of a better example, let's take the word ""balls"" in English. One meaning of it is ""spheres"", another ""testicles"". So when there is a joke on ambiguity like ""she kicked my balls"" then there are two possible ways of interpreting it. However when translating into German, there would be a problem, as it doesn't have the same polysemy as German. If I just translated it as ""sie hat meine Bälle getretten"", normally no German would even think about testicles. To convey the other meaning one would say ""sie hat meine Eier getreten"", which would be literally ""she kicked my eggs"", which on the other hand no English speaker would normally think of testicles. I think, though rather immature example, it shows how translation can loose information. In my example it has lost its ambiguity. Of course I don't think something like a testicle joke won't appear in the Quran, but I think you can imagine that scenario happening, when word **X** is used as a metaphor for an concept or something, however by translating it the nuances get mixed up. I think one can compare it very well with rap. If I translate a very good rap, it looses most of its effect and meaning, because raps are generally very culture specific.

Also a good example are the German words ""Gemütlichkeit"", which is often said to be not translatable into one word. To be honest, I would just translate it as ""cosiness"", but maybe I just misapply the meaning. For argument's sake let's say it's whole meaning isn't translatable with one word. Even though German and English culture are relatively close to each other, there are cultural words which don't translate well into English. Now, imagine translating the Quran which is influenced by a much different culture than the English one. The occurance of such words as ""Gemütlichkeit"" is much higher, than between English and German, and may have much bigger differences and significance.

Also, a significant translation error which found a way to common belief is the Apple of Eden. AFAIK it was never specified that the fruit was an apple, however because it was translated as ""malum"" into Latin which meant ""apple"" and ""evil"", depending on the lenth of the **a**. IIRC it was some sort of pun.

And also, if I'm not completely wrong, isn't it also adviced for Christians to also read the original texts if possible, at least in more serious settings.

&gt; Thallus wasn't a Christian. We know about his writings from Julius Africanas who was a Christian writing much later. Africanus cites Thallus saying that there was darkness due to an eclipse. Africanus contests this, because at the time of the crucifixion during the Jewish Passover when the moon was not in the right place of the sky. The wikipedia article you linked dismisses this because it's a second-hand reference. But so is a good portion of all our history from antiquity. 

Oh, I didn't noticed that he isn't a christian, thanks for mentioning. Isn't it dismissed, because we can calculate solar eclipses and there was none near the date of the pasover? The only solar eclipse that could have been able to be seen was on the 24 November 29 according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness#Naturalistic_explanations). The lunar eclipse explainations are questionable. I mean I don't think the moon's reflected sun light has any major effect on the brightness of the day. The other explainations are possible, though I find it strange that it was written down so vaguely. However if one of the other explainations happened, I don't think it would be considered a miracle, but rather just a coincident.

&gt; But I think the seven points I laid out in m other reply to you does put the weight in favor of authenticity. I also think that if the NT had no miracles, none of it would be controversial in the least.

Yes, I also have the impression that most historians think NT is mostly correct, except the miracles part. I also personally do think that NT is mostly historical, if one excludes the supernatural/devine stuff.
However you also give me the impression (man I use this phrase too often), that you believe in the truthness of the miracles which are reported to have been done by Jesus and you also say that Christianity's miracles have more credence. Though I don't see how the methods you listed can differentiate between truth and the common belief of the people (living around the author). Most authors didn't live at the time of Jesus (I infer by your posts that only Paul did), that means that the only other source would be the common belief of the people, however thay may not reflect the truth. 

I infer by your posts, that except Paul no biblical author ever met Jesus. So how can we be certain he didn't lie somehow. Maybe he was converted by people around him, so that he genuinly started believing, so that he just took the events for granted somehow. I'm skeptical believing in just the testemonty of one or few people.

You appear to believe in Christianity not only because you were brought up this way, but also because you are convinced by evidence. So I'm interested how do you view the Islam and its credability. One of the main reasons you listed you belief in Christianity is because its miracles have attestation. I'm aware you said you don't know much about the Islam, but Islam has also attestation of its miracles. Does that fact make it for you more credable or kind of an alternative to christianity? If not, why exactly?

Normally, scavengers, water, and microbes destroy whole carcasses after a few years at most, but what about animal remains buried in mud during Noah’s Flood that then dried into hardened sediments? Rapid burial kept scavengers from them, or we’d have no fossils. And rapid drying would limit microbe growth.

As I see it, you should look at the fossilization of soft tissues and evolution in general the same way. Flat earth is ""debunked by simple observations"", and I think creationism is debunked by some simple and not so simple observations. The linked article obviously is in the not so simple category, but still an observation, fact.

Clement did not meet Jesus.  I didn't mean to imply he did.  Neither did Mark or Luke who wrote two of the four gospels.  Still these sources are far closer to the original events than we have for almost everything else in antiquity.  Also it's very difficult to date Clement as late as 140 because Paul mentions Clement in his letter to the Philippians (verse 4:3), and Paul was killed in the mid sixties.

If this seems difficult, consider that earliest biographies of Alexander the Great, by Arrian and Plutarch, were written over 400 years after his death, and this is where our history of him comes from.  I mentioned Bart Erhman previously, who is an agnostic new testament historian, former Christian, and probably the leading critic of historical Christianity today.  Even [he says](http://mp3.aomin.org/805Transcript.pdf) ""For the New Testament we have much earlier attestation than for any other book from antiquity.""

All.  Jesus was crucified in 30-33AD.  The earliest book of the new testament was Paul's letter to the Galatians, which might have been written around 45-50AD.

&gt; Since the authors were believers, 

The books of the New Testament has about a dozen authors, but Paul is the only one who has his name signed to a majority of them.  So in one respect it was largely written by a man who was formerly one of Christianity's greatest foes.

122,"&gt; I believe a general all-purpose creationism is as scientifically testable as any other theory. If you are trying to identify one particular Creator, that would be harder to test for. The scientific method is decent as far as it goes. But it can not get to ultimate truth. At the highest levels, ""Science"" does not claim to get to truth. It only claims to get ""closer to truth"". That is true, but by the time it is distilled down for public consumption, it is presented as unassailable truth. For the masses, the message is ""you must believe what we tell you. You may only challenge us if you have a doctorate that we have granted to you.""

&gt; In reality it is obvious that the scientific method is useful, but it makes no truth claims. That would be like using the Scientific method to test the validity of the scientific method. It's blatantly circular. It's just another manifestation of the regress argument.

However in the end the scientific method is the best we have. I may be not perfect, but it is all we have. So even though we may not be able to use it to pin point the truth. So in the end one should still use it.

&gt; Once we have put ""science"" in its proper place, yes, creationist claims can be tested with the scientific method. Some off the top of my head:

&gt; Russel Humphreys accurately predicted the strength of the magnetic fields of some distant planets based on assumption of young age.

&gt; The rate at which helium escapes into the atmosphere matches creationist predictions

&gt; Creationists have claimed to have been finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones for at least 20 years. It has only gained mainstream acceptance in the past 3 years or so.

&gt;Creationists predicted that non encoding DNA was also non-junk. Project encode backs this up. They have found a use for something like 80% of all DNA so far. This does not leave enough ""junk DNA for evolution to tinker with. 

I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on them so I let it be. Though I was under the assumption that ""Junk DNA"" was never a thing and was only used colloquially and ""non-encoding DNA"" was the proper name. So when you say non-encoding DNA was also non-junk, do you mean Creationists found out that they are encoding or what exactly? If that, I think nobody is saying that Creationists can't may scientific correct claims.

&gt; It's just another test to see if we are talking about contingent beings or necessary beings. If contingent beings create morality, then their morality is likewise contingent (subjective). If necessary beings create morality, then morality is necessitated (objective).


Maybe that's because of my English skills, but I can't follow you again. What I get is that in your view, contingency and morality is important for identifying the true creation myth. But I don't understand why do you think morality is something that is important?

And you still don't answer why you put all religions into two groups, and IMO also falsely, because several other religions have the criteria, you stated, to be with the Abrahamic religions. How is this grouping important to state that one creation myth is ""better"" than the other? So let's say for arguments sake, group 1 has objective morality and group 2 hasn't. How does it bring us nearer to the truth?

















&gt; By the way, if Morality is not objective, we can not decide that by consensus. We would need an objective test.

But it is easily seen. First of all, I'd like to define how I was taught was morality even is. Basically to say it short, morality just states what is and what isn't an acceptable behavior in an culture. Certain aspects may vary more than other aspects, cross-culturally. In the following I will state several examples:

For example, let's take slave ownership. Now one would consider it immoral to have slaves, at least in our western cultures. However some time ago, e.g. in America slave ownership was not considered immoral, at least in the southern states. This alone shows that morality is culture specific.

Let's take nudity or sex. In cultures heavily influenced by abrahamic religions, nudity and sex are pretty immoral to have if not married. In other cultures it's less of an issue. One can see for example in A. Greek society that nudity and sex was all in all moral even without marriage.

Let's take homosexuality. In cultures heavily influenced by abrahamic religions, homosexuality is very immoral. In some cultures it is/was even punishable by death. Again in A. Greek society that is not the case, and homosexuality was more accepted. Pederasty was even in a legal code somehow.

Let's take pederasty/pedophilia (there may be a difference, but I think in today's western culture they are mostly the same). In the A. Greek culture pedophilia was all in all rather acceptable. In today's western culture pedophilia is not acceptable at all.

These where examples that show how certain aspects are not universally moral or immoral, but culture-dependant. That alone shows that morality is subjective. Than there is a more individualistic approach.

Let's take people with anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) (psychopathy, sociopathy), which IMO shows the best that there is no objective morality. One can write very much about ASPD, but in a nut shell one can say, even though anti-social disorder is a spectrum, the main difference between ""normal"" people and them is that they don't have an emotional response to morality. For example, if we, the ""normals"", do something that is moral, or in other words is viewed as acceptable in our culture, we feel good; if do something that is immoral, or in other words is viewed as unacceptable in our culture, we feel bad. People with ASPD just don't have that response. They know just like you and me what is acceptable in their society, but they just can't feel it emotionally, because of how their brain is wired. For example we were taught that lying is bad, so that we feel generally bad when we do it. ASPDer don't feel the bad thing. However it's also the same with good things. If we do something good for others, we feel good, but ASPDer don't feel the good thing. And they are only the extreme.

Let's take moral dilemmas for example. If morality is objective there shouldn't be something like moral dilemmas, because there would be always an objective solution which all can agree on. Let's take these: You kill a person or 5 people die; you kill your parent or 5 people die; you kill a person or 5 near familiy members die. The dilemmas are is it better to not kill a person and let 5 people die or is it better to kill a person and let 5 people live. Is it better to kill a family member and let 5 people live or vice-versa. Is it better to kill a person and let 5 family member live or vice-versa. Some say one should stay away from doing killing even if it kills 5 people, others say it's better to kill one person to save the other 5. Some say they would never kill their parent and rather let the other die, though if the roles were reversed they'd kill the person to let 5 family members win.

I got somewhat carried away. I think I stop here, haha.

&gt; I'm trying to say that for Abrahamic religions, God is bigger than that. 

What evidence do you have that other religions don't have such deity/deites? As I wrote, for example it's a common misconception that Greek didn't believe strongly in their gods. I don't think they just thought as them, as I already said, as just some sort of powerful witches. They were feared just as much as the Abrahamic god.

&gt; Yeah, pretty much. You can do some general tests to see if the basic framework is plausible, but you're not gonna pin every little detail down.

Are you reffering here to ""Do you think of the Genesis creation myth also as mostly irrelevant cultural paradigm that has no more (and no less) empirical evidence than any other?"" or ""Because I got the impression that you think the Christian creation myth has more reasons to be believed in than others.""?

&gt; Yeah. I'm willing to double down on that one. Take a box. Stick the entire universe inside the box. Now ask yourself ""If it is right to call any being ""god"", then is that being greater than the sum total of all matter and energy (same stuff, I know) inside the box, or is that being equal to or less than all the matter and energy inside the box?"" If greater you have the three Abrahamic religions to choose from. If less you have all the other religions and all other philosophies. I know of some other religions that say there is a creator god, but that god is unapproachable and unknowable. There is such a being in early Mesopotamian religions, and Baha'i and Greek thought and other stuff. But if that being is unknowable, unapproachable, or an impersonal force then the religion functions as in category two. It still says the universe and everything in it is on its own. No outside help.

But again, where do have it from? It appears to me that it's only your opinion that their god isn't as big as yours. Again all religions see their gods as all-powerful as the Abrahamic, though in the polytheistic case the power is more or less divided. I don't think any fundamental Hindu will say they don't see their gods as the biggest things and bigger than universe or something like that. A hindu might also just say the same thing as you and he might have the same evidence/non-evidence.

And I also didn't get the reason even why should a having a ""bigger"" deity/deities make a creation myth truer? So for arguments sake, let's say I have a religion were the god is like you said only the universe and not larger. So how would it make this religion less true?

&gt;Baha'i

It may be contested, but one can say Baha'i is also an abrahamic religion, as its prophets are descendent from Abraham.

And also another question. You say Abrahamic creation myth is truer. But which one. Islam has another creation myth than Christianity and Judaism IIRC.

124,"&gt; I'm curious where you heard someone was saying this was contested?

Oh, my bad, I realized I mixed up some facts. I was remembering being taught that there was something about Jesus' life where there wasn't much common concesus about. I kind of assumed it was the crucifixion.

&gt; I'm in the US so I tend to know more about Mormonism than Islam. But the enemies of Islam who were converted because they were subjugated. James and Paul became among Christianity's main evangelists after being converted. We know less about James, but Paul said he converted because he saw Jesus alive after he had been killed.

I'm not a historian, so take it with a grain of salt, but over the years I read some histories, and for example the Mongols converted to Islam. IIRC they were the ones invading/conquering/subjugating Muslim regions. Similarly, in South India Arab traders brought the Islam over, so that a relatively large Muslim community was created, so that even Mosques were build, though I don't know whether the Muslims were only the Arab traders or also the native inhabitants. Later Muslims conquered also some parts of India, though it was mostly North India IIRC. I'm not really sure about that, but it seems the Turkic people also adopted the Islam without being conquerred. At least, the Turkic groups around the desert Kyzylkum (Kazakhs, Turmens, Uzeks etc) acquired Islam not through conquest. Also Islam spread to Indonesia without conquest, and is now the country with the most Muslims in the world. Also looking at a [map of the percantage of muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam#/media/File:Islam_percent_population_in_each_nation_World_Map_Muslim_data_by_Pew_Research.svg), one can see that there are countries in East Middle Africa that have a relatively high Islam population. Because of their distance to the ""Muslim Empire"", I suppose they also became Muslim not by conquest, though I don't know anything about them.

There are more examples of that like Buddhism. AFAIK, Buddhism spread also mostly without conquest. For example, China adopted it without being conquered by any other Buddhist nation, as well as Japan. Buddhism also spread to Indonesia, though was then, as I already wrote, outnumbered by Islam.

&gt; Do you have a particular miracle in mind? Afaik they are rather poorly attested and late.

I don't know much about them. The most frequent I heard was the linguistic miracle of the Quran. It is written so perfectly (in Quran Arabic), that only God could have written it (AFAIK, the Qur'an is the direct word of God). Many Muslims challenge others too write something comparably beautiful as the Quran, according to them it was never achieved. As a hobby linguist, I find it far-fetched, as beauty and language is very subjective. Also one has to define what ""beauty"" is.

Then one I also heard often is that IIRC most Quran verses were not revealed in chronological order. And even though there weren't in no chronological order, it all makes sense if one puts it together. In addition to that, IIRC the word ""middle"" is in the middle of the quran somehow. Either the word is in the middle of all words or the verse, in which the word ""middle"" is, is in the middle of the Quran.

Then there are some others, I don't know much about. IMO [google](https://www.google.de/search?q=Islam+miracles&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=vOTWWIK6F_SA8QfLkaGYCA) will help you there better than me.

&gt; Thallus (50s) wrote about darkness and an earthquake around the time of the crucifixion. First Clement (late first century) mentions the resurrection and other miracles. But why a distinction on ""biblical context""? If the early Christians had decided to include Clement in the canon, would it not count? If they had decided to exclude the book of Hebrews, would it then count? When Justin Martyr wrote to the Roman Emperor Antonius Pius (a non Christian), he cited Rome's own historical archives (now lost to us) where he could read that Jesus healed diseases and raised the dead. But if his last name isn't a clue, things didn't end well for Justin Martyr.

I never heard of these sources, so I googled it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallus_\(historian\)) says "" A common view in modern scholarship is that the Crucifixion darkness is a literary creation rather than a historical event."". And the google page of [Crucifixion Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness) says ""Modern scholarship, noting the way in which similar accounts were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Book of Amos and the Book of Exodus."". So as a layman, I would have a hard time believing it.

The google page of [First Epistle of Clement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_of_Clement) says ""The letter was composed at some time between AD 80 and AD 140"". I may be wrong, but I don't think at that time the author would have met Jesus personally, and IMO the author only wrote what he heard about him. Since I'm not very knowledgeable about that, I can't say determitive statements.

Maybe ""biblical context"" isn't the right term, but I basically mean with it any literature which purpose it is more or less to spread or convey the religion, or something between the lines. If I got it correctly, all/most literature about Jesus was made after his death, so that most information is what the common populus was talking about and not what actually happened. Since the authors were believers, they only wrote down the ""best"" indormation. That's why I think a distinction between ""biblical context"" and not is important for such things like miracles. Though I don't know how to define it properly. It's all assumption though, please correct me if I'm wrong. 

For example, many miracles are based on the Hadiths. Hadiths are secondary literatures about Mohammed and his deeds, however, similar to biblical literature written many years after Mohammed. Some of them depict miracles either of God or Mohammed. However one wouldn't, at least I wouldn't, use them as evidence for the miracles either God or Mohammed supposedly did, as they are written in an ""quranic/muslim context"", and were more or less used to spread/convey Islam in a similar process described above. The authors most probably wrote down what was said about Mohammed, and the ""best"" information was written down. Again, if I'm wrong about this, please correct me.

138,"Wait, can you explain one thing then. Surely if the heliocentric model was true, in places of high latitude, like the arctic, in their summer where they see the sun not set for many days/weeks but it is always in the sky, they would have to see the sun go left and right and effectively zig zag in that way continuously?

First, take a look at this vid just as a reminder about what I am talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndlQNicOeso


Anyway, this is due, according to mainstream science, to the tilt of the earth causing the circle of that northern place to never take them out of the light of the sun. Like a circular path of a carousel which is tilted at an angle so that it rotates not in purely the horizontal plane, but also slightly in the vertical plane, meaning the rider goes up and down as well as 'right' and 'left'.


So in the arctic summer, this northern part of the earth is tilted towards the sun. Ok.


Let's say that a person is standing at that northern place/country when they are at the lowest point of that circular path. This is where the sun would appear the highest to them in the sky and would be directly above pretty much. As they keep looking at the sun, but are now turning 'left' (anti-clockwise rotation of earth) they are also going up. This causes the sun to appear to them as if it is going 'right' as well as 'down'. Ok.


When they are the furthest 'left' of their circular path which has been taking them away from the sun, they now continue going up (their path *upwards* is still halfway done) but they now start going 'right' whilst still facing the sun. Now they are being taken back inwards, towards the sun. Therefore as they are looking at the sun it should keep going down as they are going up, but it should be going 'left' now as they are going 'right'. But this doesn't happen, as you can see in that video. In the videos of this phenomenon, the sun is always going right, as well as up and down.

But on flat earth even if I were to accept that there was some massive conspiracy theory, it is still debunked by simple observations we can all perform:

1. You can see distant objects disappear over the ocean horizon--the bottom disappears first because the earth is curved.  [This photo](http://stupidconspiracies.org/misc/toronto.gif) looking at Toronto from Olcott, New York (39 miles away) shows that it sinks a good deal below the horizon.

1. You can call someone on Skype that lives on the other side of the world. It will be night time when it is daytime for you. If the earth were flat then we would all experience day and night at the same time.

1. You can see the shadow of the moon on the earth during a solar eclipse, and a round shadow of the earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse.  This can't be explained by the earth being a flat round disk because we see solar eclipses during the day, but it is still night time for people on the other side of the world.

1. People in the southern hemisphere can see different stars than those in the northern hemisphere, such as Polaris.  They also see the whole sky rotating around a different point in the sky, which matches their latitude based on the curvature of the earth.

",4,1490439679,2017-03-25 07:01:19
151,"Time for a very sincere answer.

So, first off, I'm going to say this: I do not believe the earth to be an immovable flat disc-ish thing. However, I want to emphasize to everyone involved, that it is not logically impossible for this to be the case.  Nor is it logically impossible that you are in the Matrix.

So, as to your first question, I do think it is *possible* that the earth is flat. However, I do not think the earth is flat.  (Just like it is *possible* that I am currently dreaming, but I do not think that I am currently dreaming.)

Second, I do not trust secular scientists.  Or any most any scientist, for that matter.  I actually don't think that the verses in the Bible say what you're saying they do.

For instance, in that 1st Chronicles passage--that is clearly poetic. In the very next verse, the ""heavens are glad""---This is cool and interesting, sure. But it is not like Genesis 1, which is written as a historical narrative.  A lot of obviously figurative language is around it, like ""let the earth rejoice.""  Dirt doesn't rejoice, and sky isn't glad.  It's definitely figurative here.  I'd say the other passages are like that, too.

If you want, I could go through literally each and every passage with you and explain why I do not think it is saying what you think it does.

But this leads us to the next question: Why does God describe the earth in such a way that it is compatible with a flat earth model?  Well...I'm sure that there are some that would say it doesn't.  But I would say that there is ambiguity of language enough that it could logically allow for it.  As to why? I would say, so folks like yourself might give him a listen, and get convicted over your own wrongdoing, and ask him for forgiveness.  That's why.

So...as to your big / final / bold question...as a creationist, sure, the flat earth model *could* be incorporated into my system, if it turned out to be true.  But I don't think it's going to turn out that way.  ",8,1490439254,2017-03-25 06:54:14
152,"&gt; As Creationists, why can't the flat earth model be incorporated in your belief system?

Because the Flat Earth model is wrong and lives on a conspiracy theory that the moon landing was fake and that all of the images we have of the Earth today are photoshopped. It's special pleading. 

The other verses you cited ignores contradictory verses like the Earth hanging from nothing and the mention of the terminator which is only possible in the Ball Earth model. The verse you cited of God stretching or rolling the Heavens is often used as support of a expanding universe and has nothing to do with a solid dome. The solid dome myth is strong, since we don't even have information on what exactly the Hebrews believed in the past. Most of it comes from a belief that the Mesopotamian's did in the Enuma Elish and so therefore, the Hebrews did as well. If I remember correctly, this started around the time of Voltaire and it's one of the most powerful claims you'll find on the internet that isn't true. The word used in Hebrew is "" rāqîaʿ"" and before the enlightenment this was commonly interpreted as Expanse and usually thought of as some unknown substance, not a solid dome. God calls the Expanse ""Heaven"" and the birds fly in it.

Job 37:18 is the one often cited but there are problems with that verses translation

1. The Hebrew word rei, translated ""mirror"" is found nowhere else in the Old Testament. If you look at a Hebrew dictionary you will find it is derived from the Hebrew word raah, which means ""to appear"" or ""to see.""

2. The meaning of the Hebrew word [shachaq]( http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/hebrew/nas/shachaq-2.html ) is usually ""cloud"" or ""dust."" And in this verse shachaq is poorly translated to mean ""Sky"" or ""Heaven""

Most apologists point out that Job 37 is referring to a Storm for the first several verses so it talking about Clouds makes WAY more sense.
When citing Psalms you have to remember that it's a poetic book and from the very start, you can tell it shouldn't be taken literally by its language. Joshua is describing what he saw that day from his point of view. Not poetry or non-literal like the Psalms mostly are, but from his reference point. I don't see the challenge to inerrancy and these aren't even the best ones you could cite.

157,"&gt;The problem you are not addressing is how can something evolve if it isn't replicating,

I) The ones that *can* replicate start to evolve.

&gt;how can it replicate in any serious manner if it isn't already homochiral.

II) The ones that have started to evolve, and were homochiral by happenstance, evolve more efficiently. 

III) The more efficient homochiral replicators outcompete the less efficient replicators. Only homochiral proteins and/or ribozymes remain.

&gt;No one has put a credible alternative in terms of amino acids alone in that discussion. 

You're again arguing with something noone said. 

Of course we know life didn't just evolve from amino acids alone in water. ",4,1490412757,2017-03-24 23:32:37

163,"&gt; Did they do this by breaking or mutating a gene at certain places?  Could one demonstrate shared mutations in these various crops as a result of design rather than common descent?

They genetically engineer the seeds so that they would create plants whose seeds can't be planted.  They did this so as to force farmers to buy seeds from them every year.  If you're interested, I can suggest only a google search since I've long since lost all my links. 

&gt; Could one demonstrate shared mutations in these various crops as a result of design rather than common descent?

They did put intentional markers which one might call damage on some of their GMO plants so they can sue farmers who grow crops without Monsanto's authority.  The did indeed do things so that their trademark design could be detected. I don't know however if in fact they put ""made by Monsanto"" across all their GMO's, but they sure did something.

&gt;1) Do we have more shared defects in common with those animals who are more like us than with those who are less like us?

Don't know, but I would guess so.  For example bacteria don't have diabetes or cancer, but mammals do.

&gt;2) Are there some shared defects that we have in common with animals who are supposed to be more distantly related to us than chimps but which do not appear in chimps? For instance, (hypothetically) do we share a defect with raccoons that we do not share with chimps?

I don't know, but I would imagine so.  When I hear veterinarians talk, I'm often struck how they characterize so many ailments in animals as the same kind of ailment in humans.

For example type 1 diabetes in dogs:
https://www.vetinfo.com/type-1-diabetes-symptoms-in-dogs.html

As far as I know, type 1 diabetes may have a genetic component.  Unfortunately I'm not aware of a mammalian-wide gene comparison.

I should point out, if they do find mammalian-wide genetic disorders, it's good evidence natural selection doesn't work so well to weed out heritable diseases and would support John Sanford's genetic entropy claims.",1,1490407709,2017-03-24 22:08:29
164,"&gt;Because self-catalysed replication and polymerisation implies tautologically that a dominant handedness would evolve.

No it does not.  Self-catalyzed replication experiments happen with pools of already homochiral substances.

Heterochiral mixtures prevent secondary structures like alpha helices from forming, hence a functional polypetide doesn't form to even start sorting things out.  

How are these peptize going to catalyze each other?  In the solid state? Unlikely, so in the aqueous state? But in the aqueous state where the products are subject to spontaneous hydrolysis to break apart what little is put together.

But, experimental evidence is on the side of my claims.  A dead pool of amino acids stays that way.  No exceptions have been found, and no one seriously believes a pool of amino acids will spring to life spontaneously.

The problem you are not addressing is how can something evolve if it isn't replicating, and how can it replicate in any serious manner if it isn't already homochiral.

Theory and experiment are on the side of the claims I put forward.  

No one has put a credible alternative in terms of amino acids alone in that discussion.  I don't expect them to because they would be fighting well understood chemical concepts like the Gibbs free energy profiles of the reactions in question.",3,1490406805,2017-03-24 21:53:25

167,"1.  Yes.  Likely because we have more genes in common with animals that are more like us.  Otherwise they wouldn't be more like us.

2.  Yes.  And between other animals too.


Here are some examples of number 2:

1.  The vitamin C pseudogene in [bats and songbirds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145266/?report=classic): ""Given the currently accepted phylogeny of bats, these results therefore conclusively demonstrate that inactive genes can be reactivated during evolution [Fig 5 shows this would have had to independently happen twice] ... If one assumes that the inability to synthesize vitamin C is ancestral in the Passeriformes [songbirds], then the ability of synthesizing vitamin C has been reacquired four times. If one assumes that the ability to synthesize vitamin C is ancestral in the Passeriformes, then the ability of synthesizing vitamin C has been reacquired three times and lost twice.""

2.  [In a gene called Uox](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/5/640.long):  ""The nonsense mutation (TGA) at codon 107 is, however, more complicated than others. It occurs in the gorilla, the orangutan, and the gibbon, and therefore requires multiple origins of this nonsense mutation.""

3.  [Humans and sheep](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1134321/pdf/biochemj00108-0076.pdf):  ""Therefore the calculations confidently predict that the two related human and ovine [sheep] P2 pseudogenes of known sequence arose independently of each other from their respective P2 genes. It appears that the occurrence of a stop codon in exactly the same position in the sequences of both the human and ovine pseudogenes is coincidental.""

1.  In a paper called [SINEs of the perfect character](http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/9979.full) (I love that title): ""Even simple insertions and deletions within coding regions have been considered to be unlikely to be homoplastic [occurring independently], but numerous examples of convergence and parallelism of these events are now known.""

2.  The third row in figure 7 [in this e coli paper](http://www.jbc.org/content/270/25/15327.long#F7) shows 4 lines of e coli independently mutating the same 182bp deletion 4 times, which occurred ""between a perfect 7-base pair direct repeat"".  Another 317bp deletion was observed to evolve independently twice.

3.  [Another in e coli](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/1/113.full.pdf), ""Nine independent deletions were observed, but seven of them had breakpoints identical to the previously characterized H1 deletion [see Figure 2A] ... the frequent appearance of the Hl deletion is likely the result of an especially long (13 bp) repeated sequence at it's endpoints"".  They conclude, ""This study provides a compelling reason to avoid the assumption that parallel evolution of deletions is rare until the mechanisms underlying insertions and deletions are better understood.""

4.  In [this study](http://www.nature.com/oncsis/journal/v1/n2/full/oncsis20121a.html), researchers saw ""a seven nucleotide duplication, affecting codons 108–110 resulting in a frame shift and premature stop codon at position 150"" in two unrelated human families, demonstrating ""that this mutation arose independently"".

170,"&gt; First off, I'd like to ask you, is creationism a scientific fact or rather a belief for you? I ask this, because IMO if it's only a belief, there is no point talking about. If it's a scientific fact for you, you should be able to show scientific evidence

I'll do my best.  I guess I'm more of an armchair philosopher than an armchair scientist.  You may find better, or more detailed answers from others on this sub.

I believe a general all-purpose creationism is as scientifically testable as any other theory.  If you are trying to identify one particular Creator, that would be harder to test for.
The scientific method is decent as far as it goes.  But it can not get to ultimate truth.  At the highest levels, ""Science"" does not claim to get to truth.  It only claims to get ""closer to truth"".  That is true, but by the time it is distilled down for public consumption, it is presented as unassailable truth.  For the masses, the message is ""you **must** believe what we tell you.  You may only challenge us if you have a doctorate that we have granted to you.""

In reality it is obvious that the scientific method is useful, but it makes no truth claims.  That would be like using the Scientific method to test the validity of the scientific method.  It's blatantly circular.  It's just another manifestation of the regress argument.

Once we have put ""science"" in its proper place, yes, creationist claims can be tested with the scientific method.  Some off the top of my head:

Russel Humphreys accurately predicted the strength of the magnetic fields of some distant planets based on assumption of young age.

The rate at which helium escapes into the atmosphere matches creationist predictions

Creationists have claimed to have been finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones for at least 20 years.  It has only gained mainstream acceptance in the past 3 years or so.

Creationists predicted that non encoding DNA was also non-junk.  Project encode backs this up.  They have found a use for something like 80% of all DNA so far.  This does not leave enough ""junk DNA for evolution to tinker with.  

That's just off the top of my head.  If you want to go deeper on any of those, you may want to find somebody around here who is really into it.

&gt;However, why do you have these criteria in the first place? I quite don't understand it. Also, last time I checked, the common concensus was that there was no objective morality, but only subjective. So I don't know how there could be an absoulute standard for motality. Also why should they have absolute morality?

It's just another test to see if we are talking about contingent beings or necessary beings.  If contingent beings create morality, then their morality is likewise contingent (subjective).  If necessary beings create morality, then morality is necessitated (objective).

By the way, if Morality is not objective, we can not decide that by consensus.  We would need an objective test.

&gt;To be honest, I have a hard time following what you mean. Why should matter and energy (IIRC according to Einstein they are the same thing), if we increase the dimensions? Which scientists say that?

&gt;Personally, I don't think anything in our universe must apply to the ""simulation operators"". I mean if you look at our games for example. They are more or less life simulations, but only much less complex than life. IMO we can only say that, the simulation operator(s)'s universe must be more complex than ours, by that analogy, at least.

Yeah.  that didn't make sense, did it?  How about this?  The universe could be sitting in a proverbial box on God's proverbial bookshelf for all the significance it is.  I am trying to get away from the idea that God is confined to another universe, which is basically like our universe, but at a different scale.

If you feel like it, go look up ""the last answer"" by Isaac Asimov.  In his short story he postulates that the sum total of all matter/energy and all knowledge in the entire universe is as close as you're going to get to ""god"".  I'm trying to say that for Abrahamic religions, God is bigger than that.  

&gt;Do you think of the Genesis creation myth also as mostly irrelevant cultural paradigm that has no more (and no less) empirical evidence than any other? Because I got the impression that you think the Christian creation myth has more reasons to be believed in than others.

Yeah, pretty much.  You can do some general tests to see if the basic framework is plausible, but you're not gonna pin every little detail down.  You know about the evolutionary tree of life I'm sure.  The creationist framework has multiple trees.  So you would have one horse-like ancestor.  Then on that tree you would have Zebras and donkeys and horses and the like, all coming from one horse like ancestor.  Then you would have a dog like ancestor.  On the dog tree you would have wolves and coyotes and all the different dog breeds and so on...  But you don't have the horses and doge merge into one tree if you go back far enough.  I don't think ""science"" would ever get a person to the day 1, day 2, day 3 thing, although people do postulate what they call an ""orchard of life"", and then they do work to try to discover which animal belongs on which tree.

I don't believe Science can prove anything.  It can only disprove things.  In that regard I do not think science can give the ""Christian myth...more reasons to be believed""

&gt;However where do you have that that's were ALL they believe in started with this, and why are Abrahamic religion excempt from that, at least you give me that impression?...[snip]

Yeah.  I'm willing to double down on that one.  Take a box.  Stick the entire universe inside the box.  Now ask yourself ""If it is right to call any being ""god"", then is that being greater than the sum total of all matter and energy (same stuff, I know) inside the box, or is that being equal to or less than all the matter and energy inside the box?""  If greater you have the three Abrahamic religions to choose from.  If less you have all the other religions and all other philosophies.  I know of some other religions that say there is a creator god, but that god is unapproachable and unknowable.  There is such a being in early Mesopotamian religions, and Baha'i and Greek thought and other stuff.  But if that being is unknowable, unapproachable, or an impersonal force then the religion functions as in category two.  It still says the universe and everything in it is on its own.  No outside help.

176,"Separate reply here because I'm introducing a lot of new material to this discussion.

&gt; Could you do a short ELI5 and tell me what this evidence is despite bible verses?

The documents that were later collected together to be the new testament are our primary source material for early Christianity.  Without those our knowledge is pretty limited.  You could go with sources written later--but material usually get more unreliable with distance from an event, so why would you want to?

But I think there are some good criteria we can use to determine whether an ancient author is likely telling the truth, or just blowing smoke:

1. The criteria of multiple unique attestation. Multiple sources all giving us different perspectives and details about an event, with some overlap.

2. Undesigned coincidences. Multiple sources give us pieces that only make sense when put together. E.g. How did Matthew and Mark know what happened to John the Baptist in Herod's household? Because Luke 8:3 tells us ""Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household"" was a follower of Jesus.  Likewise in John 6:5 why does Jesus ask Philip (almost never mentioned otherwise) where to get bread?  Luke 9:10 tells us they were near Bethsaida, and John 1:44 tells us Philip was from Bethsaida.  There are dozens of these. Fabricated lies don't corroborate additional details.

3. The criteria of embarrassment. If something casts negative light on an author or his friends, but the author tells us anyway it's probably true, while embellishments and fabrications typically display people (the authors and their associates) in a positive light focusing on their triumphs.   In the NT we're told the Jews said Jesus was demon possessed and later that the body was stolen. Paul had a murderous past, Jesus' mother and brothers thought he was crazy, women as the first witnesses to the resurrection, Peter denied, Nicodemus and John the Baptist doubted, the disciples abandoned Jesus in fear, and then he was flogged and crucified--the most humiliating death of all.

4. As we talked about before:  James, the brother of Jesus, was a skeptic during Jesus' life. Paul formerly hunted and killed Christians. But both became Christians and died as martyrs refusing to recant after encountering the risen Christ. Nearly all the other disciples met the same fate for the same reason. The gullible make good martyrs but liars do not; if they had fabricated it's expected they'd recant to save themselves.

5. There's little motive for fabrication--Jesus' followers lived under poverty and persecution. None of the three categories of motives (power, wealth, and sexual gain) fit. Mohammad and Joseph Smith used religion to gain all three.

6. If you give too many details of a falsehood's time, places, and people involved, it can easily be disproved. But the NT is full of very public claims that went unchallenged. ""God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it."", as Peter addressed the Jerusalem crowd in Acts 2.  Likewise you don't list high-profile people like Joseph of Arimathea, Pilate, or Herod in made-up stories because everyone knows them (or their relatives/friends) and could go back and use them for fact-checking.

7. We can build histograms of common names from first century documents and tombs, and the common names in the new testament gospels are the same common names found in other documents from near first century Jerusalem, following a similar curve.   Name frequencies change over time and from place to place. Moreso, we see patterns where common names have qualifiers added to them. Take a look at the following paragraph from Matthew 10:2-4:  ""Simon (1), called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James (11) the son of Zebedee, and John (5) his brother; Philip (61) and Bartholomew (50); Thomas and Matthew (9) the tax collector; James (11) the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (39); Simon (1) the Cananaean, and Judas (4) Iscariot, who also betrayed him.""  The parenthetical numbers indicate how common the name is among first century documents, and you can see that the lower numbers have qualifiers like ""the tax collector"" added to them.  This pattern permeates the gospels.   It's unlikely that first century fabricators would know to get minor details like these right in order to fool 21st century historians.

I'm not saying any of these are proof.  They're not.  But each one makes us more confident the documents are reliable, and makes it less likely they are fabricated.",4,1490392802,2017-03-24 18:00:02
177,"&gt; I was under the impression the common concensus was that we can't be for sure whether a crucifiction happened.

1.  Gerd Lüdemann is a widely respected atheist new testament historian.  [He says](http://books.google.com/books?id=RdECNYZrAgIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Jesus%E2%80%99+death+as+a+consequence) ""Jesus' death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.""

2.  Bart Erhman is a NT historian and a leading agnostic critic of Christianity.  He's written (in a book not available online) that ""One of the most certain facts of history is that Jesus was crucified on orders of the Roman prefect of Judea, Ponitus Pilate.""

3.  Craig Evans is a NT historian and a Christian.  He [wrote](http://ge.tt/3ou33of/v/0):  ""Perhaps one of the most significant areas of consensus involves the factors lying behind Jesus' crucifixion. Virtually all agree that the Romans were the principal players.""

I could give you a dozen more if you'd like.  I'm curious where you heard someone was saying this was contested?

&gt; Jerusalem was destroyed and rebuild several times, thus removing most possible evidence. 

Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans, following a Jewish rebellion.  But our evidence is from documents--primarily the new testament documents, which were in circulation throughout the Roman empire before that time.

&gt; How does showing that critics converted indicate that the religion is true?  One could say the same about Islam.

I'm in the US so I tend to know more about Mormonism than Islam.  But the enemies of Islam who were converted because they were subjugated.   James and Paul became among Christianity's main evangelists after being converted.  We know less about James, but Paul said he converted because he saw Jesus alive after he had been killed.

&gt; How was Jesus not a charismatic leader?

Jesus certainly was charismatic.  Sorry I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

&gt; Mohammed/Quran did many miracles

Do you have a particular miracle in mind?  Afaik they are rather poorly attested and late.

&gt; outside of biblical context there is no evidence that supports miracles and such.

Thallus (50s) wrote about darkness and an earthquake around the time of the crucifixion.  First Clement (late first century) mentions the resurrection and other miracles.  But why a distinction on ""biblical context""?  If the early Christians had decided to include Clement in the canon, would it not count?  If they had decided to exclude the book of Hebrews, would it then count?  When Justin Martyr wrote to the Roman Emperor Antonius Pius (a non Christian), he cited Rome's own historical archives (now lost to us) where he could read that Jesus healed diseases and raised the dead.  But if his last name isn't a clue, things didn't end well for Justin Martyr.",3,1490392757,2017-03-24 17:59:17

&gt;    Jesus was crucified under order of Pontias Pilate

I'm no historian, but last time I checked I was under the impression the common concensus was that we can't be for sure whether a crucifiction happened. If I remember correctly one of the reasons was that Jerusalem was destroyed and rebuild several times, thus removing most possible evidence. However it's generally believed that Jesus existed though outside of biblical context there is no evidence that supports miracles and such.

&gt;    Within a few years or less of this event, his followed were convinced they saw him rise from the dead.


&gt;    Former skeptics like Paul and James also became Christians because they were convinced Jesus rose.

I kid you not, reading your post was like a ""blast from the past"". It was all the stuff we used to talk about on the internet 20 years ago. I am not trying to belittle your questions at all. It is actually very interesting to me to see somebody from (what I believe is) a different culture and an earlier dialogue. In case you were wondering, we never reached a resolution, but we did quit bringing it up so much out of exasperation. Now, on to your other stuff.

Haha, glad to give you some nostalgia.

____

First off, I'd like to ask you, is creationism a scientific fact or rather a belief for you? I ask this, because IMO if it's only a belief, there is no point talking about. If it's a scientific fact for you, you should be able to show scientific evidence.

&gt; If you believe that the simulation operators exist in a universe where the physical laws are such that the simulation operator[s] have an absolute understanding of their eternality, and have an absolute (absolute, as in not merely expedient) standard for morality then I would put you in category one. If the simulation operators do not know how they ""came to be"" and/or do not have an explanation for morality beyond expedience then I would put you in category two.

However, why do you have these criteria in the first place? I quite don't understand it. Also, last time I checked, the common concensus was that there was no objective morality, but only subjective. So I don't know how there could be an absoulute standard for motality. Also why should they have absolute morality?

&gt; Prometheus was a function of the universe. Prometheus did not create the universe out of nothing. Thus, he was not the actual creator.

Even though you put it in quotes you didn't answer the question ""Why do you put all others in the second group?"". 

I misunderstood your usage of ""intelligent designer"". I thought you meant with it some deity who created all living things, kind of. So he didn't created it. However one could say that in one (but IIRC the most mainsteam) version of the Ancient Greek creation myth, Chaos was the creator god, in a similar fashion as Yahweh, though instead of creating the world directly, he created dieties, which in turned caused everything else.

&gt; I may have already answered this. But if not, then I will say that if the universe ceased to exist, then Prometheus would cease to exist with it. On the other hand, if the universe ceased to exist, an intelligent designer would not cease to exist. In theological terms... (I'm a Christian, but I'm pretty sure Muslims came up with this one first) Prometheus is a ""contingent being"" and an intelligent designer is not a contingent being. This is because an intelligent designer existed before any of the universe existed and He created it.

I don't know what's your opinion is about it, but I assume you have only the mainstream opinion. You put it as if A. Greeks didn't believe their gods were all-powerful. They were all in all less poweful than Yahweh in the Abrahamic religions, but that's mostly because Yahweh is kind of a combination of all ""aspects"", whereas polytheisitic deities represent usually one ""aspect"", but that doesn't mean they believed them to be, Idk, some sort of, for the lack of a better word, only powerful female and male witches.

Also, as I said, Idk about the other religions, but in A. Greek religion, at least in the mainstream creation myth Chaos was the universe and he created everything else.

&gt; If we postulate ""one simulation away."" then we are just saying its turtles all the way down. I mean nothing of the sort. I am saying that reality would then have (I don't know...) more dimensions or different dimensions or a completely different physical (or non-physical) framework where matter and energy can be created out of nothing. I mean every one of the 30+/- fine tuning arguments are completely valid for our universe only. Foundationally, we can not presume they apply to the simulation operator[s]. If you agree then we agree.

To be honest, I have a hard time following what you mean. Why should matter and energy (IIRC according to Einstein they are the same thing), if we increase the dimensions? Which scientists say that?

Personally, I don't think anything in our universe must apply to the ""simulation operators"". I mean if you look at our games for example. They are more or less life simulations, but only much less complex than life. IMO we can only say that, the simulation operator(s)'s universe must be more complex than ours, by that analogy, at least.

&gt; I will grant you this. However, Big Bang Theory, abiogenisis, the Anthropic Principle and Common Descent are all nothing more than another mostly irrelevant cultural paradigm that has no more (and no less) empirical evidence than any other. It is supported by nothing more than a culturally apropos genetic fallacy. Naturalism is its own ""creation myth"".

Do you think of the Genesis creation myth also as mostly irrelevant cultural paradigm that has no more (and no less) empirical evidence than any other? Because I got the impression that you think the Christian creation myth has more reasons to be believed in than others.

&gt; It's not all they believe in. It's where they start. From there they diversify. To the best of my knowledge, there is no other philosophy or religion that claims an accessible and non-contingent (aka ""Necessary being"") Creator. It's impossible to prove a negative but I have been looking for another one for about 20 years. If you find another one then let me know. I will happily include it in my list. I actually thought I was being generous in including some people who believed in a simulation.

However where do you have that that's were ALL they believe in started with this, and why are Abrahamic religion excempt from that, at least you give me that impression?

I'm a little unsure what you mean with ""accessible and non-contingent"", but I guess with accessible you mean you can interact with deities and with non-contingent the deity is independent somehow, like not created by anything else. Again, why should the ""true"" religion have a creator of both attributes? IMO the non-contingent part is in a way understandable, but why should you be able have get into contact with him/her/it?

In A. Greek religion gods were usually very well accessible. They had much spiritual experience with him. One example can be seen in Homer's Oddyssey or Illiad for example, where almost every times a deity intervenes. For example, Socrates was among other things put to death because of impiety, that IMO does imply that A. Greeks held their gods sacred. The gods weren't non-contigent, if I understood the term correctly, however Chaos was non-contingent, as he was the first who was and created everything else.

&gt; You got me there. The word is Gnostic and that's where I know it from. If the word is Greek, what did it mean before the Gnostics adopted it? 

One could roughly translate it as ""fullness"", as it comes from πλήρωμα. Which in turns is derived from πληρόω ""to fill"" and -μα, which is a nominalizer. [Here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%AE%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek) is the wiktionary page.

The doctrine of election seems to be mostly settled, but Christians often do a wonderful job disagreeing with each other at the sight of any vague opportunity. Five chapters ahead we find a corollary verse:

I actually don't think that's what the scripture teaches.  Jesus himself said:

If the requirement was that we have perfect understanding and perfect knowledge and a Christian worldview to believe God in our unsaved condition, then none of us would be saved.  

Jesus understands we may not first believe in him before we begin to see the truth.   Richard Lumsden, Dean of a science department at Tulane, is that of a man who first realized he was so wrong about so many things just based on the evidence.  He didn't have a Christian world view to start with, but God was able to help him see the light even while his mind was in darkness.  Then God's light broke through the darkness.

From what I can tell, the student that started Lumsden on the road to his conversion must have used the arguments like the one I'm using.

238,"&gt;What troubles me is shared broken genes or mutations because these cannot be accounted for by common design unless the designer is trying to trick us or is imperfect, and God is neither of these.

Actually I had no problem with shared mistakes, if that really is the case.  Lots of animals died in Noah's flood.  Was the guilt the animals guilt, or was it Adam's and the rest of mankind the reason the animals died?

I think its possible that however God broke humans, he could put that break in the animals as well since he obviously let his wrath pour on the animals for man's sin.  Lots of animals have juvenile diabetes.  Veterinarians know there are lots of shared defects between humans and animals.  Why should this not extend to the genome????

I should add, human intelligent designers like Monsanto created self-destructing seeds.   God created a world that had the capacity to self-destruct if man sinned, and that is what is happening on so many levels.

&gt;The last option seems to be what you are suggesting. Am I right? 

It accounts for some of it, but I think death is now engineered in some mammals.  

You listed 3 options, and now I add the 4th, namely deliberate malevolent design.    The plagues of Egypt weren't benevolent designs.  I think the death and decay in this world is also by design.

Romans 8:20
&gt;**For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it,** in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its **bondage to corruption** and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 

Creation is in ""bondage to corruption"" as in decay and death and maybe a few other things.  That is by design.

Some IDists say our world is ""the best of worlds"".  That's not what the scripture teaches.  Our world is the ""momentary light affliction"" that is building for us a weight of glory 2 Cor 4:17.

The false assumption is that God wouldn't engineer malevolent designs.

246,"As discussed, we don't know for sure if these are mistakes anyway.  It's possible many Alus could now be functionless, not because of the Alus themselves but for some other reason than we suppose.  That is, some of the machinery that was surrounding or needed to make the Alu might be damaged now.

I'm doing a little research on the patterns of similarity and diversity.  What evolutionary biologists interpret as phylogeny is actually steganography.  

&gt;**Steganography**

&gt;Finally, we come to the research theme that I find most intriguing. Steganography, if you look in the dictionary, is an archaism that was subsequently replaced by the term “cryptography.” Steganography literally means “covered writing.” With the rise of digital computing, however, the term has taken on a new life. Steganography belongs to the field of digital data embedding technologies (DDET), which also include information hiding, steganalysis, watermarking, embedded data extraction, and digital data forensics. Steganography seeks efficient (that is, high data rate) and robust (that is, insensitive to common distortions) algorithms that can embed a high volume of hidden message bits within a cover message (typically imagery, video, or audio) without their presence being detected. Conversely, steganalysis seeks statistical tests that will detect the presence of steganography in a cover message. 

&gt;Consider now the following possibility: What if organisms instantiate designs that have no functional significance but that nonetheless give biological investigators insight into functional aspects of organisms. Such second-order designs would serve essentially as an “operating manual,” of no use to the organism as such but of use to scientists investigating the organism. Granted, this is a speculative possibility, but there are some preliminary results from the bioinformatics literature that bear it out in relation to the protein-folding problem (such second-order designs appear to be embedded not in a single genome but in a database of homologous genomes from related organisms). 

&gt;While it makes perfect sense for a designer to throw in an “operating manual” (much as automobile manufacturers include operating manuals with the cars they make), this possibility makes no sense for blind material mechanisms, which cannot anticipate scientific investigators. Research in this area would consist in constructing statistical tests to detect such second-order designs (in other words, steganalysis). Should such second order designs be discovered, the next step would be to seek algorithms for embedding these second-order designs in the organisms. My suspicion is that biological systems do steganography much better than we, and that steganographers will learn a thing or two from biology, though not because natural selection is so clever, but because the designer of these systems is so adept at steganography.

&gt;Such second-order steganography would, in my view, provide decisive confirmation for ID. Yet even if it doesn’t pan out, first-order steganography (i.e., the embedding of functional information useful to the organism rather than to a scientific investigator) could also provide strong evidence for ID. For years now evolutionary biologists have told us that the bulk of genomes is junk and that this is due to the sloppiness of the evolutionary process. That is now changing. For instance, Amy Pasquenelli at UCSD, in commenting on long stretches of seemingly barren DNA sequences, asks us to reconsider the contents of such junk DNA sequences in the light of recent reports that a new class of non-coding RNA genes are scattered, perhaps densely, throughout these animal genomes. (microRNAs: Deviants no Longer. Trends in Genetics 18(4) (4 April 2002): 171-3.) ID theorists should be at the forefront in unpacking the information contained within biological systems. If these systems are designed, we can expect the information to be densely packed and multi-layered (save where natural forces have attenuated the information). Dense, multi-layered embedding of information is a prediction of ID. 

&gt;It’s time to bring this talk to an end. I close with two images (both from biology) and a final quote. The images describe two perspectives on how the scientific debate over intelligent design is likely to play out in the coming years. From the vantage of the scientific establishment, intelligent design is in the position of a mouse trying to move an elephant by nibbling at its toes. From time to time the elephant may shift its feet, but nothing like real movement or a fundamental change is about to happen. Let me emphasize that this is the perspective of the scientific establishment. Yet even adopting this perspective, the scientific establishment seems strangely uncomfortable. The mouse has yet to be squashed, and the elephant (as in the cartoons) has become frightened and seems ready to stampede in a panic. 

&gt;The image that I think more accurately captures how the debate will play out is, ironically, an evolutionary competition where two organisms vie to dominate an ecological niche (think of mammals displacing the dinosaurs). At some point, one of the organisms gains a crucial advantage. This enables it to outcompete the other. The one thrives, the other dwindles. However wrong Darwin might have been about selection and competition being the driving force behind biological evolution, these factors certainly play a crucial role in scientific progress. It’s up to ID proponents to demonstrate a few incontrovertible instances where design is uniquely fruitful for biology. Scientists without an inordinate attachment to Darwinian evolution (and there are many, though this fact is not widely advertised) will be only too happy to shift their allegiance if they think that intelligent design is where the interesting problems in biology lie.

247,"&gt; I'm embarrassed to ask this, but what is homoplastic? 

No worries brother. Homoplastic mutations are convergent mutations. Homoplasy [definition]( http:www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/homoplasies.asp ) Is

""A homoplasy is a character shared by a set of species but not present in their common ancestor. A good example is the evolution of the eye which has originated independently in many different species. When this happens it is sometimes called a convergence.""

When they are calling ALU insertions non-homoplastic in the literature they are saying that it's unlikely that they inserted through convergence. Most point out they are randomly inserted throughout the genome and so independent convergence is rare, which I disagree with. I was saying that the shared error argument fails in many ways because they (Mutations, Insertions) actually can happen independently in the genome and within hotspots in the genome since we've observed this many times.

&gt; these Alus, imho, are genuine mistakes in the human genome. 

Through Genetic Entropy? I'd say that's correct. Mutations are eventually going to do it. I think that most ERVs are the product of some former functional elements that got degraded through mutations and became viruses. I can see the same with certain ALUs also, possibly becoming parasites.",2,1490366252,2017-03-24 10:37:32

249,"&gt; that a certain religion's creation myth is the new truth

I think Christianity has much more evidence supporting it than any other religion.  Antony Flew was a famous atheist who spent his life debating against Christians.  Near his death he became a deist but never a Christian.  He said:  ""The evidence for the resurrection is better than for claimed miracles in any other religion. It's outstandingly different in quality and quantity.""

Among the minority of New Testament historians who reject the resurrection (Jews, agnostics, atheists), they still widely agree that:

1.  Jesus was crucified under order of Pontias Pilate
2.  Within a few years or less of this event, his followed were convinced they saw him rise from the dead.
3.  Former skeptics like Paul and James also became Christians because they were convinced Jesus rose.

Whether you agree or disagree with them, there is no other religion that has its critics conceding so much.  The others involve at best a charismatic leader with few or no claimed miracles, or legendary development over many centuries.",6,1490364832,2017-03-24 10:13:52
250,"&gt; why do you think so few biological scientists believe in creationism?

I once put this list together for someone else who asked the same question.  Some of this is speculation.  

1.  Many immediately reject creation or ID from the many embarrassingly bad ""why are there still monkeys"" arguments used by laymen.  They assume there's nothing beyond that.

2.  It's what they were taught in school and they never questioned it.  ""I didn't give it much thought; It wasn't my area of concern"", as Michael Behe [reflected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9SmPNQrQHE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m00s) of his postdoc research days as an evolutionist.  ""college students have not been shown the weakness of Darwinian evolution"" as Joseph Kuhn [wrote in 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246854/?report=classic).

3.  A lot of biologists aren't exposed to problems outside their own field.  For example paleontologist and ID critic Don Prothero [wrote that](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ptb/6959004.0001.001/--stephen-jay-gould-did-he-bring-paleontology-to-the-high?rgn=main;view=fulltext) ""Nearly all metazoans [meaning animals] show stasis, with almost no good examples of gradual evolution... the prevalence of stasis is a puzzle that has no simple answer"" but lamented, ""by and large the neontological [non-paleontologist] community still 'doesn't get it'... The journal Evolution continues to publish almost no contributions by paleontologists""

4.  Others just don't talk about the problems.  Renowned chemist James Tour (inventor of nanocars) [describes](http://youtu.be/PZrxTH-UUdI?t=52m3s) his own experience: ""Let me tell you what goes on in the back rooms of science – with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. I have sat with them, and when I get them alone... I say, ""Do you understand all of this, where all of this came from, and how this happens?"" Every time that I have sat with people who are synthetic chemists, who understand this, they go 'Uh-uh. Nope.' These people are just so far off, on how to believe this stuff came together. I've sat with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. Sometimes I will say, 'Do you understand this?' And if they’re afraid to say 'Yes,' they say nothing. They just stare at me, because they can’t sincerely do it.""

5.  Some see anything other than materialistic naturalism is seen as a violation of scientific professionalism.  [At one conference](http://www.fredheeren.com/washtimes.htm), ""Chinese scientists encouraged the investigation of a variety of new hypotheses to explain the Cambrian explosion: hydrothermal eruptions, sudden seafloor changes, even intelligent design. This last was too much for one American paleontologist who stood up and shouted, 'This is not a scientific conference!'""  Likewise the famed Lynn Margulis (proposed symbiogenesis theory) [said](http://discovermagazine.com/2011/apr/16-interview-lynn-margulis-not-controversial-right), ""The critics, including the creationist critics, are right about their criticism. It’s just that they've got nothing to offer but intelligent design or 'God did it.'""

6.  Many biologists don't have much training in engineering.  Many of the patterns claimed to only arise by common descent are the same I see in the code I write or among other objects designed by humans.

7.  Some recognize insufficiencies in evolutionary theory, but hope new theories will arise to resolve them.  Evolutionists [Depew &amp; Weber published in 2012](http://ge.tt/8zEY5DM/v/0?c): ""Darwinism in its current scientific incarnation has pretty much reached the end of its rope...  however, we are confident that a new and more general theory of evolution is evolving.""

8.  A bias toward sensationalism in the media--which is true everywhere and not just with evolutionary biology.

9.  It's taboo to publish anything from the ID movement.  As [one example](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/08/on_the_origin_o_3075521.html), last year Springer was going to publish 20-so-papers from ID proponents.  They had already passed Springer's internal peer review and Springer agreed to publish them.  But a public campaign threatened to boycott Springer if they published, even though none any of the critics had even read the papers.  Springer complied, but the papers were still published in World Scientific after also passing peer review there.

10.  A small number of rather popular evolution ""evangelists"" shame anyone who dissents from the Party line.  For example see [Jerry Coyne's response](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/lynn-margulis-disses-evolution-in-discover-magazine-embarrasses-both-herself-and-the-field/) to Lynn Margulis claiming evolution doesn't work (cited above).  Coyne says she's ""dogmatic, willfully ignorant, and intellectually dishonest,"" ""wrong in the worst way a scientist can be wrong,"" and ""embarrasses both herself and the field.""

11.  Rigged debates.  Sean B. Carroll (well known biologist) [wrote a critique](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5830/1427.full) of Michael Behe's work in the journal Science:  He cited ""the tuning of color vision in animals"" as a response to Michael Behe as an example of observed evolution creating through a long process of gradual steps.  To support this, Carroll cites his own book where he describes (based on phylogney) lineages would have had to evolve color vision multiple times, lose it, and then evolve it again.  This would have happened among the presumed ancestors of reptiles, fish, and mammals so none of it is even observed to begin with.  Behe [correctly noted](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20160812074352/http://behe.uncommondescent.com/2007/06/response-to-critics-part-2-sean-carroll) that Carroll's papers show ""different species have different protein binding sites"" but ""they demonstrate nothing about how the sites arose.""   Behe submitted [a brief response](http://ge.tt/67r7YOg1/v/0?c), only to have Science to trim the last 100 words.  Science gave Carroll [a far longer response](http://ge.tt/67r7YOg1/v/0?c) chastising Behe for not addressing this very point he addressed [in the 100 words that were trimmed](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20160812182651/http://behe.uncommondescent.com/2007/10/back-and-forth-with-sean-carroll-in-science-2/).",4,1490364147,2017-03-24 10:02:27

255,"&gt; Do you think creationism should be taught in school?

Both it and evolutionism are historical interpretations. As such, they neither one belong in the ""science"" classroom, except as any historical interpretation might be incorporated into a science classroom. To say that Evidence X is in line with the creationist model but conflicts with the evolutionist model. Evidence Y does the opposite, Evidence Z matches with both, and Evidence Q conflicts with both, is not to ""teach"" creationism or evolutionism; it's to teach model-building and interpretative frameworking and contrast/comparison.

But to ""teach creationism"" (or ""evolutionism"") in a ""Science"" class? No.

&gt; Do you think of creationism more of a belief or more of a scientific fact?

It's a belief. So is evolutionism. Scientific evidence may support or conflict with one or the other or both.

&gt; If belief, why do creationists advocate creationism over evolution?

Two basic reasons:
1) ""Because the Bible told me so"", and most creationists come from a Bible-favoring culture, which ingrains that mentality into them.

2) It's a sensible alternative to evolutionism. ""Intelligent Design"" is also a sensible alternative, but only postulates the probability of a creating Intelligence without specifying who that is or what kind of personal relationship we might or might not have to it or about any details about the IDer's origins. Creationism goes a step forward in claiming that this Intelligence has communicated to us, in the form of the Bible, and it's that book that informs the creationist as to some of the details of his origins.

I realize that many dispute the historicity of the Bible, but I'm convinced it's a better historical document, by far, than the historical documents of other faiths.

If that's what you remember me saying, it's understandable why you think that you *won.*

Because I don't think you could possibly be further away from what I actually said.

&gt;Viruses do evolve into other viruses, but the first viruses did not evolve from something that you would recognize as a modern virus.
Once upon a time, there were protocells and protoviruses which were very similar to each other, but one was a parasite and the other a host. A billion years later, their descendants are very different.
Because we know of environments in which topo isn't necessary (i.e., small linear genomes and single stranded genomes), it's most parimonious to reach the conclusion that the common ancestor of cells and viruses originally had genomes which did not require topo, and the present condition is a result of coevolution between viruses and their hosts.
It is even feasible that this interaction is what led to the environment that facilitated the evolution of large, topo requiring genomes, and topo, at the same time. (As a poster above mentioned, topo may have evolved first in viruses and then been acquired by cells.)
You're making a mistake I see creationists often make; you assume the current, incredibly convoluted web of life is the only way life can work at all. really, It only looks that way because it's been evolving pseuso randomly for almost 4 billion years.

&gt;What do you think of the papers in the literature that state that ALUs are ""Excellent markers for Phylogeny"" Because of them not being Homoplastic? I haven't found many answers but I'm curious to what your thoughts are.

I'm embarrassed to ask this, but what is homoplastic?

I think for human phylogeny they are good markers as far as Alus unique to each line of humans.  

These Alus, imho,  are genuine mistakes in the human genome.  Most of the Alus are essential, but  they are toxic if they break away from the original design and insert themselves where they're not supposed to be.

They are so toxic that when they insert themselves where they shouldn't be, that there is no way, in the opinion of many creationist geneticists, that any primate could tolerate 1 million insertions (about 10% of the genome) over any length of time.",2,1490337904,2017-03-24 02:45:04

267,"&gt; His hatred of ID is so obvious

Just like most of BioLogos. I used to be a Theistic Evolutionist myself before I had a crisis of faith and realized I can't be honest with myself regarding Genesis and believe in Evolution or that God even guided or set up the process because of the problem of dead end species. It just wouldn't work. I had countless Christians on the Liberal side of the spectrum recommend me BioLogos and Dennis Venema. I have read most of what they have written and at the time I had no idea that Creationists like you or the ones that belong too CMI, AIG, ICR even existed so I thought it was settled science
 and it always astonishes me that fellow professing Christians are willing to argue against a Designer and with their writings being no different then the Atheists I read. Some form of Creationism is needed to be a honest Christian IMO.

&gt; There is no way to tell just by looking at the genome if it is a mistake or was intended

Well in most ERV or Transposon debates I've read or participated in, the 2 common evidences they use to show that some or most are worthless retroviral insertions are

1. Reverse Transcriptase

2. LTRs 

Which we do see in HIV-1 is in fact, mostly the case and then you see the constant phylogeny's of the retroelement families. But I have seen papers that challenge both of those assumptions the more we learn so what I thought was a problem for me and other Creationists, might not actually be the case. We are starting to have answers for why 8-15% of ERVs and others, might have LTRs and target-site repeats flanking them. Perhaps most viruses descended from ERVs? That could be very plausible. We just need to learn more and continue to study these things and I'm confident more clearer answers will come about by reading the SINES from the LINES of evidence. (Couldn't help myself)

What do you think of the papers in the literature that state that ALUs are ""Excellent markers for Phylogeny"" Because of them not being Homoplastic?

272,"Thanks for taking the time to reply.  You said you grew up in Germany, and there are not many creationists there.  I absolutely believe you.  Everything you said is pretty much exactly the conversations we had here in the US in the early to mid '90's when the internet was in its nascency.  I kid you not, reading your post was like a ""blast from the past"".  It was all the stuff we used to talk about on the internet 20 years ago.  I am not trying to belittle your questions at all.  It is actually very interesting to me to see somebody from (what I believe is) a different culture and an earlier dialogue.  In case you were wondering, we never reached a resolution, but we did quit bringing it up so much out of exasperation.  Now, on to your other stuff.

&gt;Actually, I forgot to add that I'm technically an ID believer, because I kind of believe, or at least consider it for possible, for the universe being just a simulation, and thus the beings doing it being kind of gods. Though to add to this IMO it doesn't only imply an creator god but also creator gods.

If you believe that the simulation operators exist in a universe where the physical laws are such that the simulation operator[s] have an absolute understanding of their eternality, and have an absolute (absolute, as in not merely expedient) standard for morality then I would put you in category one.  If the simulation operators do not know how they ""came to be"" and/or do not have an explanation for morality beyond expedience then I would put you in category two.
&gt;Why do you put all others in the second group? As long as I know, most of them have more or less something like a intelligent designer. For example IIRC in the A. Greek religion it was believed that Prometheus created living beings on the earth. So he may not be the highest god (he was in fact a Titan, which is however a type of a supreme being, as a Gods), but still. There are also other religion's creation myths I can't remember right now.

Prometheus was a function of the universe.  Prometheus did not create the universe out of nothing.  Thus, he was not the actual creator.

&gt;Also what do you mean exactly by an intelligent designer?

I may have already answered this.  But if not, then I will say that if the universe ceased to exist, then Prometheus would cease to exist with it.  On the other hand, if the universe ceased to exist, an intelligent designer would not cease to exist.  In theological terms... (I'm a Christian, but I'm pretty sure Muslims came up with this one first) Prometheus is a ""contingent being"" and an intelligent designer is not a contingent being.  This is because an intelligent designer existed before any of the universe existed and He created it.

&gt;How can you say that even an interlligent designer who is only one simulation away has related physical laws which has something in common with our own universe?

I am not saying this.  I am saying that we exist in a universe where you, me and everything else is governed by physical laws whereby we cannot increase matter and energy in the universe.

If we postulate ""one simulation away."" then we are just saying its turtles all the way down.  I mean nothing of the sort.  I am saying that reality would then have (I don't know...) more dimensions or different dimensions or a completely different physical (or non-physical) framework where matter and energy can be created out of nothing.  I mean every one of the 30+/- fine tuning arguments are completely valid for our universe only.  Foundationally, we can not presume they apply to the simulation operator[s].  If you agree then we agree.

&gt;As long as I'm concered every mythology of any religion has a creation myth, and thus more or less also a ""creator god""

I will grant you this.  However, Big Bang Theory, abiogenisis, the Anthropic Principle and Common Descent are all nothing more than another mostly irrelevant cultural paradigm that has no more (and no less) empirical evidence than any other.  It is supported by nothing more than a culturally apropos genetic fallacy.  Naturalism is its own ""creation myth"".

&gt;Why do you think that's all the religions of your second group believe in? And why do you think the Abrahamic religions are excempt from that?

It's not all they believe in.  It's where they start.  From there they diversify.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no other philosophy or religion that claims an **accessible** and **non-contingent** (aka ""Necessary being"") Creator.  It's impossible to prove a negative but I have been looking for another one for about 20 years.  If you find another one then let me know.  I will happily include it in my list.  I actually thought I was being generous in including some people who believed in a simulation.

&gt;As I never heard of it I wikipediad it. According to wikipedia, there is no indication that pleroma was used in anceint greek times. The only places it's used is in a christian context. Only the name is Greek

You got me there.  The word is Gnostic and that's where I know it from.  If the word is Greek, what did it mean before the Gnostics adopted it? 

&gt;why should an intelligent designer even make a religion truer?

It shouldn't.  ID is the only thing that can answer the fine tuning argument I guess, but after that it's up to you to decide what's ""truer"".

273,"&gt; I reject the notion that all life shares a common ancestor.

The neat thing about the DNA of various living creatures being so similar is that the reason the DNA is similar across the board is because *the code is good.* I'm educated in information technology; I've written programs, and I understand binary to a certain extent. Where binary is a 2 character code, DNA has 4 distinct characters in the code; so where binary has options to the power of 2, DNA has options to the power of 4. For example, we have two binary characters with two options for each character; 00, 01, 10, and 11, or 2^2. That's four possible combinations. With DNA, you have 4 options: A, G, C, and T. That's 4^2, or 16 possible combinations; four times as many combinations as binary. When you add an additional character, binary has 8 possible combinations, or 2^3; DNA then has 64 possible combinations, or 4^3. The gulf between the two in terms of complexity only grows as you add more characters. A byte of data is 8 binary digits, or 2^8, which is 256 possible combinations of 1s and 0s in an 8 character space; for a comparable ""byte"" of DNA, it is 4^8, which is a staggering 65,536 possible combinations. And we haven't even touched on RNA.

The point is, much like a computer program (and honestly, this is over simplifying it; working, living DNA is far more complex than a computer program) you need to have a programmer design the program to get it to work at all. You can't just have a bunch of junk code come together and assemble a working program; this analogy has been used way too much, but it's accurate: having a bunch of random DNA come together and form a living organism is much like an F5 tornado sweeping through a junkyard and assembling a working F-16 fighter jet. If you ever looked at animations showing what occurs inside a single living cell, you should know that what occurs inside one cell is more complex than all of the automated factories on this planet *combined.*

There's some kind of mental block in people when I try to explain this to them; say you have a computer program, and you randomly insert just one character into the code. If you try to run the program, it *will* crash, and life is unfathomably more complex than a simple computer program. At the barest of minimums, the code for life had to be designed. The next thing the world's scientists are going to say is that aliens designed/created us for _______; no one will ask who created the aliens. I'm of the opinion that the coming great deception will be the fallen angels and demons masquerading as aliens. And before you scoff at the idea of extraterrestrials, bear in mind that, by definition, angels are extraterrestrial.


And for fun, I should mention that DNA is literally a biological information system, meaning it is subject to [information entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory); we are witnessing this in every living creature across the planet. [Humans, as a species, are getting weaker.](http://www.thedailysheeple.com/the-human-race-is-dying-dna-degeneration-would-eventually-lead-to-the-total-extinction-of-humanity_082013) We are watching the polar opposite of evolution occur, and the human race collectively still believes that evolution is how we got to where we are now.

274,"&gt; In the first group, you have the three Abrahamic religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) and you have people who believe we exist in a simulation. If you subtract out morality, then a simulation-operator is basically a stand-in for any generic creator-God.

&gt;  If the person claims that we are in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation (and so on)..... and they never get to an ultimate intelligent designer who exists in a fundamentally different place with completely unrelated physical laws that have nothing in common with those of our universe then that person would be in the second category.

How can you say that even an interlligent designer who is only one simulation away has related physical laws which has something in common with our own universe?

As long as I'm concered every mythology of any religion has a creation myth, and thus more or less also a ""creator god""
&gt; How would you know which one is right? They all believe the same three things. But then they all put their own spin on it after that. The three beliefs are this:

&gt;1) we all come from the same stuff.

&gt;2) because we are all the same stuff, humanity is part of the creative force in the universe.

&gt;3) we are evolving

Why do you think that's all the religions of your second group believe in? And why do you think the Abrahamic religions are excempt from that?

&gt; For point 1) They had the Pleroma, which was the one thing that the universe was when the universe was homogeneous.

As I never heard of it I wikipediad it. According to wikipedia, there is no indication that pleroma was used in anceint greek times. The only places it's used is in a christian context. Only the name is Greek

&gt; But I ask you, When there are so many philosophies, both ancient and modern that are telling me that the universe is all that is (despite proof), and they are all telling me that I am fundamentally made of the same stuff as a rock, or a bug or a deer and everything else, and they are telling me that I am evolving, how do I know which one to trust? I mean, everybody tells me that I am evolving, but how do I know if I am supposed to be heading toward Nirvana, or ruling an empire in order to ascend to godhood, or just waiting for a billion years? How do I know which myth to believe?

Despite asking rhetorical questions, you clearly mean that of all options the abrahamic religions must be the ones to choose. However IMO you made bunch of strawman arguments, you said that certain religions believe in something what they don't believe(d) in. For example the intelligent designer. It is true that not all religions have an intelligent designer (in my view it's someone who creates all living beings more or less personally, as opposed to someone who IS everything), but it's certainly not only the Abrahamic religions. Also, why should an intelligent designer even make a religion truer? According to the this subreddit, ID only needs that the creation of the unverse is created somehow with help of intelligence, it may be one it may be more deities. Then you said that the Ancient Greek religion believed in pleroma, which wikipedia doesn't suggest to be true, as then there would be some non-christian references. And than you simply put Abrahamic religions in one group and all other religions you just refer as philosophies.

275,"&gt;Do transposons make up the majority of genomes for all life?

For eukaryotes, yes. I don't have a reference off the top of my head, but I'm reasonably certain I've read that in most eukaryotes we've sequences, the majority of the genome is transposable elements of some kind, either DNA transposons or retrotransposons. Maize, for example, [is 85% transposable elements.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5956/1112) 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think redundancy is particularly relevant, since we can accurately identify the percentage of a genome that is coding sequence, and we generally just call protein-coding genes functional. I suppose you could find a case where that isn't the case, but my inclination is to just call anything protein-encoding functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

The biggest genomes are in unicellular eukaryotes. The biggest is *Amoeba dubia*, with 670 *billion* base pairs. And this is a single-celled organism! No developmental constraints, no tissue-specific gene expression. Just a single cell, with lots of repetitive, nonfunctional DNA. 

If junk DNA is not a real thing, we need to be able to identify functions for all of that stuff. And the stuff in the maize genome. And explain why onions and their close relatives have genomes that range from seven to 32 billion base pairs, when humans only have three billion. Does an onion require six times the information as a human, while closely related plant species (in the same genus) require twice as much again, and others are fine with less than half as much? No, none of that makes any sense. A far more reasonable explanation is that lots junk DNA has accumulated over the years. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are small eukaryotic genomes, down in the 2-3 million base pair range. Interestingly, [these genomes are exceptionally dense](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1082) - small intergenic regions, few repeats, and notably, a general lack of transposable elements. In other words, this is what a genome without much junk DNA looks like. ",2,1490324089,2017-03-23 22:54:49
276,"&gt; Why do some papers refer to ALUs as parasites or parasitic? 

Because of the damage done by evolutionary thinking.  Here is Ayala giving the standard reasons in 2010 as he criticized Stephen Meyer. His hatred of ID is so obvious:

http://biologos.org/blogs/archive/on-reading-the-cells-signature/
&gt;There are also lots and lots of DNA sequences that are nonsensical. For example, there are about one million virtually identical Alu sequences that are each three-hundred letters (nucleotides) long and are spread throughout the human genome. Think about it: there are in the human genome about twenty-five thousand genes, but one million interspersed Alu sequences; forty times more Alu sequences than genes. It is as if the editor of Signature of the Cell would have inserted between every two pages of Meyer’s book, forty additional pages, each containing the same three hundred letters. Likely, Meyer would not think of his editor as being “intelligent.” Would a function ever be found for these one million nearly identical Alu sequences? It seems most unlikely. In fact, we know how these sequences come about: one new Alu sequence appears in the genome for every ten newborns, generation after generation. The Designer at work? Unlikely: many of these sequences damage the genome causing abortion of the fetus during the early weeks of life.
&gt;Perhaps one could attribute the obnoxious presence of the Alu sequences to degenerative biological processes that are not the result of ID. But was the Designer incompetent or malevolent in not avoiding the eventuality of this degeneration? Come to think of it: why is it that most species become extinct? More than two million species of organisms now live on Earth. But the fossil record shows that more than ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived became extinct. That is more than one billion extinct species. How come? Is this dreadful waste an outcome intended by the Designer? Or is extinction an outcome of degeneration of genetic information and biological processes? If so, was the Designer not intelligent enough or benevolent enough to avoid the enormity of this waste?

You ask:
&gt;2.How many ALUs have a signature of insertion, if at all?

There is no way to tell just by looking at the genome if it is a mistake or was intended.

&gt;I'm not sure that pointing out several cases of function necessary proves they are all are functional like some of my fellow Creationists and ID proponents do, since we definitely need a percentage of function similar to the one ENCODE attempted to give us. I do think it certainly helps ease up on the shared error argument, helping us realize what they potentially did before the fall or what they do now, but then you will often hear 

Agree, I try to say ""potential function"".  But if I may point out, regarding Alu's this paper from PNAS that makes a mockery of Ayala:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901480/

&gt;“These findings bring to mind information storage models. As the number of potential editing sites in each Alu-containing transcript is high, usually several dozens, the potential for combinatorial encrypted information is enormous. Binary use of A or I in millions of sites in the neural cell transcriptome can be considered equivalent to the 0’s and 1’s used for information storage and processing by computers. It is tempting to speculate that the more abundant RNA editing found in the human brain may contribute to the more advanced human capabilities such as memory, learning, and cognition. This suggestion is consistent with the hypothesis that the advantage of complex organisms lies in the development of a digital programming system based on noncoding RNA signaling (46, 56). The combinatorial posttranscriptional RNA editing of noncoding sequences may therefore contribute to higher brain functions and may play a role in the evolution of human specialization.”

Nearly all the Alus were subject to A-to-I editing making it an amazing random access memory.

http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/12/17/gr.164749.113.full.pdf+html
&gt;Based on bioinformatic analyses and deep targeted sequencing, we estimate that there
are over 100 million human Alu RNA editing sites, located in the majority of human genes. These findings set the stage for exploring how this primate-specific massive diversification of the transcriptome is utilized.

If we take the central nervous system alone with 100 billion cells with 100 million Alu editing sites, the RAM capacity is on the order of:

10^18 bytes, sextillion bytes!

So what Ayala said was trash could turn out to be treasure!",2,1490323520,2017-03-23 22:45:20

&gt;Do you think creationism should be taught in school?

No, at least not in a science class. I have no problem talking about it in a study on worldviews or religion, but I don't think it should be a requirement. Then again, I also don't think that the Big Bang or Universal Common Ancestry should be taught as unquestionably factual science classes either. One might argue that they are not taught unquestioningly, but it is often interpreted that way by students.

&gt;Do you think of creationism more of a belief or more of a scientific fact?

I think it is a belief. I differ from some creationists on this point in that I don't think that creationism is a scientific theory. It was derived from the Bible, not from the scientific method.

Most creationists advocate creationism over Universal Common Ancestry because we think it more closely aligns with the description of history given by Genesis.

For point 1, they have the Brahman. That's as close as you are going to get to a creator God in Hinduism.  But it isn't a creator.  The Brahman is the ultimate reality of everything.  Not personal. Not separate.

Point 2 should not be too hard to demonstrate.  Reincarnation should not need that much defense.  You could come back as a bug or a cow or a bird or whatever.  All part of the Bhrahman, all connected.

3) This one shows itself in the concept of spiritual emancipation.

The Greeks has the same thing.  

For point 1) They had the Pleroma, which was the one thing that the universe was when the universe was homogeneous.

For 2) They had the same sort of pantheism where since we all came from the same stuff, we are all the same stuff.

For 3) They would Deify their leaders, as if their leaders had ascended (or evolved).  Their leaders didn't really evolve to godhood, since they had no concept of a Creator God.  But they evolved to a higher being that was just another part of the pleroma.

Same thing with secular naturalism.

1) ""We are all stardust""

2) [should be self-explanatory] Since the universe is all that is, and since we exist, therefore we are part of the thing that created ourselves.

3) we are still evolving.

But I think there's a misunderstanding here in that our critics think we claim that any feature requiring simultaneous mutations can't evolve.  That's not the case at all.  Michael Behe, who is the main proponent of the simultaneous mutation arguments, clarifies this extensively in his book, Edge of Evolution.  He uses Malaria evolving resistance to the drug chloroquine as an example of two simultaneous mutations--a main focus of the book.  In HIV where population sizes are huge and the mutation rate is several orders of magnitude greater than any cellular life, Behe [estimates](https://books.google.com/books?id=zm_NoZ6_AZoC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22to+generate+all+possible+six-nucleotide+mutations+in+HIV%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidzau_yODSAhVBwYMKHUhgDiMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22to%20generate%20all%20possible%20six-nucleotide%20mutations%20in%20HIV%22&amp;f=false) it could evolve a gain requiring up to six simultaneous mutations:

289,"Wonderful.  Ok that's great you took general biology.

One thing to note is that even to me, the arguments looked very credible even as recently as a decade ago.  A human designer can make many shared mistakes (like spelling errors in his writing), but we wouldn't expect that of God, so if evolutionary biologists characterize something as a ""shared mistake"" it becomes compelling evidence that there is shared common ancestry.  You are very right to say it's a powerful argument.

The problem for common descent evolutionary theory is if these ""shared mistakes"" are discovered to actually be functional or at least potentially functional.

That is the case with many segments of the DNA like pseudogenes and Alu repeats in the last few years only.

Since you took biology you are aware of genes.  There are definitely defective copies of genes that emerge in the process of replication that we see in the lab.  So some pseudo genes are actually what the evolutionists say they are.  But it doesn't mean that anytime one sees a copy of a gene that doesn't code for a protein (or lncRNA) that it necessarily is a mistake.  

One of the first breakthroughs was when a researcher realized cancer started to happen when there was damage to ""pseudogenes"".  A better term in that case is not pseudogene but microRNA decoy.  That was the case of the  PTENp pseudogene.  reference below.

Biologists Ken Miller testified in favor of Darwin in the infamous Dover vs. Kitzmiller debate:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District

Ken Miller argued pseudogenes were proof of common ancestry and he used the Beta-globin pseudo genes as an example.  Well after the trial and after the Darwinists won, research came out proving him wrong.

https://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/04/an_icon_of_the_/

&gt;A new paper in Genome Biology and Evolution argues that the famous beta-globin pseudogene is functional. Why is this pseudogene famous?
Well, it’s been Exhibit A — literally, offered as evidence in a court case — for critics of intelligent design who argue that our genome is full of useless, functionless junk, and therefore can’t be a product of design. Near the beginning of his testimony on the very first day of the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, Brown University biology professor Kenneth Miller testified to the court that the beta-globin pseudogene is “broken, and it has a series of molecular errors that render the gene non-functional.” (Day 1 AM, p. 79.) 

Some of the pseudogenes are involved in microRNA regulation. To understand microRNA regulation, here is a description:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA

With respect to the pseudogene I mentioned earlier, here is some data.


http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167851
&gt;Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor-suppressor gene. **PTEN pseudogene (PTENp) acts as an endogenous RNA, which regulates its parental gene by competitively binding to the 3’ UTR of PTEN gene in the human. Despite the importance of this pseudogene, little is known about the molecular evolution [sic] of PTENp in mammals.** In this study, we identified 37 pseudogenes from 65 mammalian genomes. Among them, 32 were from rodents or primates. Phylogenetic analyse showed a complex evolutionary history of this gene family. Some PTENps were shared both in primates and rodents. However, some PTENps were shown to be species-specific, such as the tasmanian devil PTENp1, nine banded armadillo PTENp1 and gibbon PTENp1. Most interestingly, the naked mole rat (NMR), an anticancer model organism, possessed 17 copies of PTENps, which were classified into four clades based on the phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, we found that all the 3’UTR of PTEN and PTENps shared common microRNA (MicroRNA) binding sites in NMR, based on our prediction of specific MicroRNA binding sites. Our findings suggested that multiple gene duplications have occurred in the formation of PTEN/PTENp gene family during the evolution of mammals. Some PTENps were relatively ancient and were shared by primates and rodents; others were newly originated through species- specific gene duplications. PTENps in NMR may function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate their counterpart genes by competing for common MicroRNAs, which may be one of the interpretations for the cancer resistance in NMR.",4,1490314260,2017-03-23 20:11:00

299,"&gt;transposons, which make up most of the human genome

Do transposons make up the majority of genomes for all life?

&gt;You could use knock-out assays, where you silence or remove one or several regions, and see if there is a fitness cost.

I unfortunately don't have an article/study link in my notes so feel free to correct any of the following information:

I've read that in some cases like that of yeast, over 80% of the genome must be knocked out until the organism can no longer live. However, they've also found that studied organisms have genetic redundancy or genetic “backups”. Therefore, when a knockout has occurred, the same function is being performed in a different way.

Essentially this would show that genomes have multiple sets of ‘instructions’ for various functions.

Before continuing on this, does this sound correct to you?

In general, would you say that organisms that reproduce rapidly have the largest genomes or are there unicellular organisms or Eukaryotas or Bacteria/etc that also have very small genome sizes?",1,1490301943,2017-03-23 16:45:43

302,"Thanks for the question! I was wondering if anyone was going to ask about junk DNA. Short version:

&gt; Was ENCODE wrong in their findings or conclusions?

Yes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's why: 

ENCODE uses an overly broad definition of ""functional."" It's really that simple. They include everything with biochemical activity, e.g. protein binding or transcription. Well...a lot of things get transcribed that don't have a *function*. 

For example, endogeneous retroviruses (ERVs), are viruses that integrated into our chromosomes and mutated, preventing them from getting out. Over time, mutations have accumulated in these now ""dead"" viral sequences in the human genome. But many of them still have promoters that attract transcription factors, and many are actually transcribed to RNA. But that don't do anything *for the cell*. They just sit there and sometimes bind proteins or make RNA. Activity, but not function. 

&amp;nbsp;

The same is true for transposons, which make up most of the human genome. Transposons are a type of mobile genetic element, so even when they become nonfunctional, some of that ancestral activity is often retained - protein binding and/or transcription. Doesn't mean they have a function.

&amp;nbsp;

A better standard than biochemical activity is to evaluate whether something has a *selected function*, meaning, has it been selected to do something *for* the cell?

There a couple of ways to evaluate this:

You could use knock-out assays, where you silence or remove one or several regions, and see if there is a fitness cost. 

Or you could sample over time to determine the dN/dS ratio, the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous (changes an animo acid) changes to synonymous (does not change an amino acid) changes in a region. If it's &lt;&lt;&lt;1, that's strong evidence the region is under purifying selection and is therefore functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

Neither of these assays are perfect. Knockouts are difficult and expensive. dN/dS isn't super useful for non-coding regions, nor regions that require a specific length, but not a specific sequence. But these two ways will provide a much more precise estimate of functionality compared to simply evaluating biochemical activity. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, there is the question of enormous genomes. Onions have huge genomes, way bigger than humans, and the onion family, all very similar, shows enormous differences in genome size. Why would that be if everything (or most of it) was functional?

Furthermore, the largest genomes are in unicellular organisms. The common explanation for the functionality in the human genome is that there is a complex control of gene expression necessitated by multicellularity, particularly during development. Well, these amoeba don't have embryonic development; they're just a single cell. But their genomes are WAY bigger than ours. If everything there is functional, what do they need it all for?

&amp;nbsp;

So yes, junk DNA is a real thing. ENCODE is wrong.

In other words the judge made a ruling on the case and as a trier of fact concluded that we proved our case that they discriminated against my religion and they failed to follow up or investigate a written complaint of religious discrimination.

A topic I haven't seen discussed much is that of Junk DNA (let me know if you have already discussed this and I'm just not seeing it). 

I'm assuming you're familiar with [ENCODE's Junk DNA Study](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6099/1159.summary) which found ""80% of the human genome serves some purpose, biochemically speaking"". 

This has caused much discussion with regard to the Theory of Evolution. Here are some quotes with regards to Junk DNA: 

[Sydney Brenner, 1998](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982298704270): ""The excess DNA in our genomes is junk, and it is there because it is harmless, as well as being useless, and because the molecular processes generating extra DNA outpace those getting rid of it.""

[Dan Graur, 2012](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/gbe/5/3/10.1093/gbe/evt028/2/evt028.pdf?Expires=1490627886&amp;Signature=A7EHhSK-Pm8wsGBWniCLZ4MHDk~uoOvC0sliqp2P0UoRcaTmpX~Ub~fqGT8qAFzawblevzltvjgzPJ~nmF9UyMpxh4timinLfdrg65D-RiT46tgh9EjcHy7eFhtGhiz09XWYtRmC5FztBl6ryLhcDIVUBDjetz0zRP-FyM8yd2esERuKmdM52uHzK~9L5K3zg572w2TaCr9J1e2M1RVkOxClV2AatmsTcpFLBrEEWIOS75r38iRUg45walfwP9UlMuUfw7zrgn0eIw7n6JcTrZsy1siNEnsfN0Q76ydH9jVPpolwBVIGWgN5kT3FDH19IVMaL1LDIQFSYYLBlqqiwA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q): ""there exists a misconception among functional genomicists that the evolutionary process can produce a genome that is mostly functional""

[Larry Moran, 2014](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-creationist-tries-to-understand.html): ""if the deleterious mutation rate is too high, the species will go extinct... It should be no more than 1 or 2 deleterious mutations per generation."" Humans have 56 to 160 mutations per generation, which would require most DNA to be loosely functional or junk in order for most to not be deleterious.”

The idea of a mostly or completely functional genome falls in line with what creationists would expect yet seems to be something Evolutionary Theory did not predict.

324,"&gt; But I'm looking for a response to the challenge for evolution is to produce large amounts of information.

Genome duplication does that, in two ways. 

First, with additional regulatory complexity, you can exert finer control over development at small spatial scales, permitting more complexity. This is why having more hox genes, and 1 vs. 2 vs. 4 hox clusters, is so important. 

Second, by duplicating everything, you permit mutations to accumulate without a fitness cost. One copy stays the same, but there isn't purifying selection against changes in the other copy, so an enzyme can target a different molecule, or a transmembrane signal receptor can respond to light rather than a chemical signal. 

And recombination is how you get novel adaptations together when they appear in different lineages. These mechanisms all work together. Saying this one or that one is insufficient misses the point; they're all operating. 

That's how you greatly increase the amount of information and complexity without having to accumulate millions of point mutations sequentially. 

Take it or leave it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I'm looking for any species we can observe evolving tens of billions of beneficial, non-destructive mutations. 

Like I said elsewhere, you're establishing an unreachable burden of proof. ""Look, all I want to to be able to watch billions of years of evolution in a petri dish."" You want billions of beneficial mutations in a genome of millions of base pairs? In the span of a few decades? Not going to happen. 

More importantly, there's an implicit error in this question, the assumption that a specific mutation or genotype is inherently good or bad. That's not the case. It's based on the environment. You can be good in one time and place, bad in another. 

If we were to grow up a population in the lab, it would adapt to that environment, then stabilizing selection would predominate, and the substitution rate (rate at which mutations are fixed) would slow significantly. Change the environment, maybe you can get it to swing in a different direction, but again, at some point you reach an equilibrium. 

So you're welcome to reject the notion that all of this is possible. 

For each of these above points, I'm not really interested in further back and forth. Respond to the above points if you like. 

&amp;nbsp;

But what I'd really like is to address this: It seems like you are rejecting inductive reasoning as a valid way to draw conclusions. 

I'm repeatedly saying ""Here's mechanism M we've observed, and it results in outcome O1. In nature, we observe very similar outcome O2, and based on our observations and experiments, we conclude that mechanism M is probably responsible.""

And you seem to be replying, ""Outcomes O1 and O2 are sufficiently different that even if mechanism M was responsible for O1, we need more direct observation of it causing O2, or something of similar magnitude, before we can conclude that it did so."" 

For example, I'm claiming since we've observed how new functions can rapidly appear in HIV proteins without loss of the ancestral function, we can conclude that this process is in part responsible for the diversity we see in extant organisms. But you argue that we cannot conclude that those processes are sufficient without much more direct observation of them leading to changes of the magnitude required for, for example, ancestral tetrapods to diversify into mammals and reptiles. 

Is that a fair characterization?

As you know, I'm looking for any species we can observe evolving tens of billions of beneficial, non-destructive mutations.  If 10^20 mammals did it, why can't we observe 10^20 microbes doing it, which there are more than enough of to do within human lifespans?

&gt; Already done: Recombination, sexual reproduction, diploidy, genome duplication. You've rejected these mechanisms as valid.

Population genetics as a field has rejected the idea that these ideas even hold a candle to the wind of factors that slow evolution (by slowing natural selection) as organism complexity increases.  Much smaller population sizes, more nucleotides, more deleterious mutations, and longer linkage blocks. Michael Lynch who is a high respected and published population geneticist [says](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/450.full):  ""all lines of evidence point to the fact that the efficiency of selection is greatly reduced in eukaryotes to a degree that depends on organism size.""

&gt; Recombination, sexual reproduction, diploidy, genome duplication

Many microbes already have recombination.   And other than recombination which produces new sequences only at very specific hotspots (in mammals), these other three just copy or reshuffle the existing information.  But I think you are arguing these speed evolution a billion-fold?

Recombination certainly can and does create rapid phenotypic change.  But I'm looking for a response to the challenge for evolution is to produce large amounts of information.

&gt; Cool, tetrapods existed earlier than we though[t]

Would a rabbit in the cambrian also show that mammals evolved much earlier than we thought, and perhaps more than once?

331,"1.  We don't know.
2.  It depends.

Sorry these are not as specific as you're looking for.  I think I don't have enough information to know if endosymbiosis is happening in the amoeba you linked.  I read the [second paper](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)00753-2) you linked in full because it was more recent and not too long.

Let's suppose one day in the remote past, a cyanobacteria got lost and wandered into this amoeba.  Over millions of years his descendants lost most of their genome that was only used as a free living organism, and eventually his psaE gene got transfered to his host.  Later, a deletion removed its shine-dalgarno motif, some introns got inserted, and the gene became expressed.

Is this macroevolution?  Depends on who you ask.  I don't even use the term because of the ambiguity involved.  If given enough time do microevolutionary changes add up to macroevolutionary changes?  Sure.  Is there enough time for this to happen in microbes?  I'm skeptical because of unrelated design arguments, but ultimately I don't think we have any good way of knowing.  Is there enough time to evolve mammals or birds or any other complex clades?  No, I don't think there is.  And not by a long shot, which I'm discussing in our other thread.

But in our other thread you say ""If this does not convince you in the least that eukaryotic cells can evolve, nothing will.""  How do we know how long this process took to happen?  Did it take some 10^38 of them before this happens with just one gene?  Or does it happen once every million years or so?  Or did God simply re-use the psaE gene this way, instead of creating a different nuclear gene that looks nothing like it but is less efficient?  Maybe you can develop this argument further and rule out some of these possibilities?

Here's something that may help:  I remember in Perry Marshall's debate with Stephen Meyer, he mentioned an experiment where symbiogenesis was observed to happen in real time.  Here is the [full transcript](http://cosmicfingerprints.com/stephen-meyer-debate/).  You can ctrl+f ""symbiogenesis"" and see where he links to the paper.  But Marshall also argues the cells would require a lot of choreography already in place to allow this to happen, which just pushes the problem of design back a notch.

333,"&gt;  Primary endosymbiosis, bacteria becoming an organelle. And your response is ""this isn't observed evolution."" Just dismiss it with a handwave. Nope, not happening.

No, this is the whole point.  Evolution is a theory of transformation, not a theory of similarity.

You are showing me a pattern of similarity that is very common in our own designs and calling it is powerful evidence for evolution.  Why do the Google Chrome and Safari web browsers both use webkit?  Common ancestor.  Why does node.js use the V8 javascript engine from Google Chrome?  Horizontal transfer.  Why is a 9"" tablet halfway between an 11"" and a 7"" tablet?  Transitional organism.  My current work project has me working with an Intel x86 motherboard that has a simple Arduino chip on the same PCB.  Most Arduinos are separate boards so this is clearly endosymbiosis in progress :)

So, how do we answer the question as to whether evolution is a good explanation for similarities?  Perhaps we could measure the rate at which evolution produces new and functional information?  Hey, that's the point I made above.  But we see something like a billion-fold difference between the rate evolution would need to create useful information in mammals, verses the rate at which we see it happening in very large microbial populations of equivalent size.

Whole genome duplications just give you the same information twice.  The issue is the rate at which evolution produces new and unique functional information.  And as you know, nobody thinks whole genome duplications played any meaningful part in mammal evolution anyway.

This is not to say you can't make any argument from similarity.  If you highlighted patterns that are expected under evolution but don't make sense under common design, then that would be evidence for evolution.  Talk Origins puts focus there for example.  But the patterns we're talking about can fit under either.

&gt; Do we need to observe a hox cluster duplication in a natural population for you to buy it?

No.  This is unrelated to my objection.

&gt; ""what would convince you?"" quite clear: Nothing.

Here's a couple things:

1.  Show me some population of microbes around 10^20 in cumulative size evolving tens of billions of beneficial, function producing or modifying mutations.

2.  Or show me a reason we should expect mammals to evolve such mutations several orders of magnitude faster than the microbes.

The items on your list:

1.  ""More genome similarity between humans and, say, birds than between humans and chimps.  Or pick whatever groups you want."" -&gt; How about mammals [sharing more genes](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7446/full/nature12111.html#f3) exclusively with fish (2059) than they do exclusively with birds (892) ?  But any evolutionist would argue that there were just different genes lost in each lineage.  Having nested similarities (but with substantial discord) is also a pattern we see in designed objects.  An iphone and an android have much more in common than either do with an ICBM missile, after all.

2. ""Tetrapods before vertebrates"" and the other A before B's:  How about [footprints](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/the-tracks-of-a-ghost/) with alternating limb movements clear traces of tetrapod toes from before the fishapods like tiktaalik?

3. ""absence of a system of hereditary inheritance""  Don't you need this for any kind of reproduction--under evolution or design?

336,"Yes, I've read a bit about that, and I have two thoughts:

First, the discovery that iron ions can preserve soft tissue is awesome. Like, that's a once-in-a-century discovery. 

Second, attempts to carbon-date these samples will never give a reliable answer. There's always going to be some background level of noise if the actual concentration is below the threshold of detection of the technique. So it's like putting a 20 point weight on a scale that maxes out a 10 pounds. How much does it weigh? Well, 10 pounds, according to this scale! 

Similarly, you can't date material that is millions of years old using a technique that maxes out around 60 thousand years. Dating rocks around the fossils using some other method, strontium, uranium-lead, whatever (I'm not a geologist or physicist, so I'm not super will versed on the various dating techniques), you get a consistent answer of at least 65 million years for dinosaur fossils. To overturn that finding, you'd need not just one contrary result, but a mountain of them, using multiple dating techniques with overlapping resolution windows.

353,"&gt; Are these truly predictions 

Yes, they are. The prediction is that organisms that are more closely related should be more similar than organisms that are more distantly related. So even though, for example insect wings and bird wings are both used to fly, we'd expect more similarity between bird wings and whale fins than bird wings and insect wings. If the opposite was true, if, for example, bird wings and insect wings had the same internal structure, and whale fins whale fins were something completely different, that'd be weird and unexpected. But we don't see that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, this kind of begs the followup question: Isn't that a circular argument? We know they're more closely related because they're similar, and we expect them to be similar because they're more closely related.

And there are two responses to that. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, we can use one set of morphological traits to determine evolutionary similarity. For example, being a vertebrate or an invertebrate. Broad characteristics. And we can then make predictions about more specific characteristics based on these broad categories. So it's not ""Based on A, these two organisms are closely related, so we expect A to be similar,"" but ""Based on A, these two organisms are closely related, so we expect B through Z to be similar.""

&amp;nbsp;

The second response is that we now use DNA sequences as the basis for determining relatedness, since we can compare across many more dimension much more rapidly that using morphological traits, and as I mentioned, we have direct, experimental validation of those techniques. So we can say, ""Based on the similarity of DNA sequence A, we know these organisms are closely related, so we expect structures B through Z to be similar."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Response to edits.

Greatest weaknesses? I think a major problem is what is sometimes called a ""adaptationist"" approach, which is ascribing a selective advantage where there may not be one to explain the presence of a specific trait. I think a lot of evolutionary change can be explained by non-selective processes such as genetic drift and neutral mutation accumulation, but this is not acknowledged in many cases. 

Strongest argument *against* evolutionary theory? This is going to sound like a cop-out, but there aren't any good ones. Oh! Did you see it? That thing that just wooshed by was any credibility I had left on this sub. But it's true. Irreducible complexity, genetic entropy, no beneficial mutations, no transitions fossils, evolution is too slow, anything Wells said above. None of it stands to scrutiny. 

Longer version of the of that quote - I think the answer is ""these processes are not constant, but they vary predictably given a few variables."" So for example, given what we know about the environment before and during the Cambrian, rapid adaptive evolution is expected. Same thing after mass extinctions. With regard to modeling mutations, we do see variation in the mutation spectra of different organisms, i.e. some mutations are more common in some thing, less common in others. To make a model accurate, you have to experimentally determine the mutation spectrum of your organism, then make sure the model conforms to those observations. Otherwise it won't do a good job. ",6,1490199443,2017-03-22 12:17:23
354,"&gt; But such similarity is one of the many accurate predictions of evolutionary theory.

First of all - thanks for the epic reply. I think I can keep my head above water on this one. Are these truly predictions and do they actually suggest a correlated or causative relationship? Could Murray Eden's view as quoted below not also provide some type of explanation?

&gt; “It is,” he wrote referring to Darwin’s theory, “as if some pre-Newtonian cosmologist had proposed a theory of planetary motion which supposed that natural force of unknown origin held the planets to their courses.” - Murray Eden




**EDIT #1:** Lastly, for the sake of time, I am very curious to ask you a similar question to what you had asked /u/JoeCoder some time ago, with a slight twist. Based on your obvious expertise in this field, what are in your opinions some of the greatest shortcomings or weaknesses of the current subsets of evolutionary theory which are so prevalent in academic circles? Or, to perhaps even venture a step further, what is your strongest argument for the converse position relative to the one you hold now on this topic?

**EDIT #2:** A slight post-script to the Murray Eden quote. Or, the ELI5, non-plagiarized version: ""Is it reasonable to assume based on an observation of a phenomena in the natural universe which continues in a predictable way at this point in time has remained constant over longer periods of time which we have not observed with no sensitive dependence on initial conditions? Is this a tenable, albeit elementary corollary to evolutionary biology in your view? Independent of the latter most question, if we concede to the first question, how do we control for scale and (the most fringe-worthy tangent) a Schroedinger-esque observer effect?"" After going through your entire response more thoroughly, I am replying with a fair amount of sleep debt and so may have still missed something, but I think the only point I can recall (which may have been from another video entirely) is regarding Darwinian genetic algorithms and the alleged curious absence of their expected function when trying to replicate some findings with computer simulations (TL;DR having to effectively fine tune your random mutation simulations).

The answer is yes, these claims have been refuted, to the extent that they are claims regarding the validity of evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Miller-Urey experiment doesn't demonstrate the feasibility of abiogenesis.

Technically correct; it's almost inconceivable that a single experiment could. But this experiment was 65 years ago. Since then, there has been [an incredible amount of work](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ssv4s/abiogenesis_hypothesis_and_evidence_of/) on the question. If you want to refute the theory of abiogenesis, you need to refute *those* experiments, not the one from 1953.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Darwin's tree of life

We use DNA sequence comparisons now, not morphological comparisons like Darwin did, and the validity of these techniques [has been experimentally verified.](http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol445D_W00/exp_phylo.pdf)


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Homology in vertebrate limbs

The objection is that the similarities themselves don't directly indicate an evolutionary relationship. That's correct. But such similarity is one of the many accurate predictions of evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Haeckel's embryos

Nobody teaches these anymore, because Haekel's theory, that organisms kind of recall their evolutionary history during development, isn't correct. What happens is that the general characteristics develop first, then increasing specific characteristics. So at some earlier states, vertebrate embryos look *more* similar than they do at later, more differentiated, states. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Archaeopteryx

This isn't the only dinosaur-to-bird intermediate. Here is a [kind of long but fun read](https://www.wired.com/2010/12/written-in-stone-excerpt/) on the topic. Also, saying ""well, it's more reptile-like than bird-like"" isn't a refutation that it represents and evolutionary intermediate. 


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Peppered moths

Nobody uses this anymore. There are better examples - antibiotic resistance, flu resistance to tamiflu, tuskless African elephants, to name a few. Plus, almost nobody disputes that relatively small-scale adaptive changes are possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Finches

Fine historical example, [but DNA sequences, not the beaks, show the relationships.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7539/images/nature14181-f1.jpg) And they don't keep growing or shrinking because the climate on the islands hasn't changed in a single direction - it fluctuates, and that climate dictates optimal beak size. But if it did go one way, you'd see corresponding, longer-term changes to beak morphology. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Four-winged fruit flies

The argument here is that changes can happen, but they are detrimental. As a counterpoint, I'd show Vpu, a protein in HIV that has acquired a completely new function compared to the same protein in SIV (the virus from which HIV evolved), without losing it's old function. So the ""old"" version of the protein does one thing, the ""new"" version does two. Ta-da, a new beneficial trait. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Horse evolution

&gt; Hominid evolution

Wells himself acknowledges that the evidence we have for both of these strongly supports the evolutionary hypothesis, but objects to the implications, i.e. that humans are ""just"" animals. Fair enough, but as far as evolutionary theory goes, these two examples strongly support it.

&amp;nbsp;

After the ""icons"" part, he talks about a few other things

&gt;Cambrian Explosion

Strong evidence *for* evolutionary theory; preceded by an increase in *genetic* diversity, climate becomes more diverse, rapid *morphological* diversification to occupy new niches. Same thing we see after mass extinctions. Exactly what you'd expect from evolutionary processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Only beneficial mutations useful to evolution.

Neutral mutations are extremely useful, since they permit an accumulation of changes that can become beneficial in other contexts, like if the selective pressures on a population change. Even detrimental mutations can be useful, if high diversity itself is favored, like in trypanosomes (parasites that mutate really fast - helps them evade the immune system).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Bacteria that evolve resistance are still bacteria.

Richard Dawkins and most evolutionary biologists will say they're open minded to Intelligent Design and Creation!

Also, someone could be an out and out liar.  So, stuff will be leaked if the vetting is only through the net.

I was part of some secret creationist groups, but we only allowed membership if there was personal contact and references.  This was really important since some of the people involved were professors at universities fearing for their jobs.

I found out the hard way how Darwinists behave in academia.  Dr. Caroline Crocker, a professor of biology at my alma mater, attended my first ID club meeting at George Mason (GMU) in 2005.  A reporter from the journal Nature was there, and 3 weeks after our story was made public in the April 28, 2005 cover story, she was fired from the university, her career permanently ruined and doomed to poverty.  The official story from GMU was that her contract merely expired, it had nothing to do with her anti-evolutionary views.  Baloney.

After that incident, in 2007 I was offered tuition-free opportunity to be a grad student at Robert Marks Evolutionary Informatics Lab.  A month before I might have started, the Darwinists shut Marks' lab down and put gag order on him...

So I went to Johns Hopkins instead (by God's grace) in 2007.  Then the Darwinists contacted professors at that University and tried to get me expelled from my graduate program, but thankfully I graduated.

Even a few years before that evolutionary biologists turned ID sympathizer Richard Sternberg was fired from the Smithsonian Institution and NIH, and it prompted Presidential and Congressional investigations that found evidence of wrong doing, but in the end weren't enough to save Sternberg.

I graduated, and Creationists Ben Carson was supposed to speak at my graduation, but then when he said marriage is between a man and a woman, he was effectively barred from speaking.

All this to say....we probably don't have much of a chance to remain private anyway.  There are too many Darwinists who have no morals and ethics about the way the treat creationists.

So closing this gap is one thing I would need to see to convince me that natural processes are sufficient.

Genome duplication. This is a thing that happens. Do you not accept this as a real process, think it happens too slowly, or can't have large effects?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;what is the greatest amount of non-functional space would you need to traverse at once to get from pro- to eukaryotes?

I *just* gave you a paper with an example of primary endosymbiosis happening. If you accept that that process is actually happening, you should have no problem accepting that eukaryotes can evolve. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Also let's talk about this thread. 

Feel free to post in it if you want to talk about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt;And an instance of primary endosymbiosis happening right now.

&gt;I responded to these in my replies to your other comments--these aren't cases of observed evolution.

Okay, look. Here's the problem. We have a case of one of the most important processes in the history of life on earth happening before our eyes. Primary endosymbiosis, bacteria becoming an organelle. And your response is ""this isn't observed evolution."" Just dismiss it with a handwave. Nope, not happening. 

That's disappointing. And enlightening. It makes the answer to the question ""what would convince you?"" quite clear: Nothing. There is nothing. Because this is exactly what anyone could want. This is the half-a-duck, the half-an-eye. It's a bacteria living inside a protozoan that is literally partway between freeliving cyanobactia and chloroplast. 

If this does not convince you *in the least* that eukaryotic cells can evolve, nothing will. You're not having this discussion in good faith. And like I said, that's disappointing. 

&amp;nbsp;

And to be fair, since I asked, let me answer: What would convince me I'm wrong?

Eukaryotic cells before the oxygen revolution.

More genome similarity between humans and, say, birds than between humans and chimps. Or pick whatever groups you want. Snakes and whales vs. snakes and lizards. Whatever.

Birds before reptiles in the fossil record. 

An oxygenated atmosphere before oxygenic photosynthesis existed. 

Tetrapods before vertebrates.

379,"&gt;A loss of reproductive capability between two populations is easy and happens all the time, and changes in ploidy are one factor that can lead to it. But what does this have to do with whether a common ancestor can evolve into flies or worms? As you know, plants don't even have hox genes. I am not following where you're trying to go with this?

This is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the *gain* of reproductive capability between two incompatible species via genome duplication in hybrids. 

The argument goes like this:

Hox clusters appear to be the result of genome duplications.

Genome duplications occur regularly - for example, it often results in speciation in plants, via [allopolyploidy.](http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/levin/bio213/evolution/polyploidspec.gif) [Here's an example.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/26645603/figure/fig2/AS:267729135468568@1440843008470/Figure-5-Examples-of-recent-allopolyploids-Tragopogon-mirus-and-T-miscellus.png) 

This same process - *just* the the genome duplication step - is the best explanation for the arrangement of animal genomes. ([Here's an example for vertebrates.](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030314http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030314))

Having additional hox gene clusters is a requirement for increasing animal complexity. 

So put it all together - hox gene function, hox gene sequence homology, genome duplication, and the answer is quite clear - successive rounds of genome duplication led to the degree of change required for the evolution in complex animals. That's how you get large-scale changes with relatively small, observable processes.

&amp;nbsp;

We can observe the process in nature, we can observe the effects of changes to hox genes in the lab, and we can see the signatures of genome duplications in animal genomes. Do we need to observe a hox cluster duplication in a natural population for you to buy it?",4,1490110192,2017-03-21 11:29:52

I pasted the wrong link to the second paper.  Here is the [second paper](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0020)--same conference.

&gt; the rest of your argument is nothing more than an argument from incredulity.

It's an argument of measuring rates of functional evolution, and it's far far too slow:

1.  After trillions of e coli, we are impressed that they duplicated their existing citrate gene a few times, landing the copies next to a promoter that expresses them when there's no oxygen.  The other beneficial mutations actually degraded or destroyed genes, giving them a net loss.
2.  A trillion malaria to evolve the 1-4 steps to gain adovaquone resistance.
3.  10^20 malaria to evolve chloro-quine resistance.
4.  10^20 HIV to evolve &lt; 5000 beneficial mutations shared among the various strains.
5.  We don't know how many bacteria to evolve the 5-step cipro resistance, but I would guess numbers somewhere in this same range.

This is certainly functional evolution.  I even [argue against creationists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/33acvp/evolution_can_and_does_create_new_information/) who say this isn't new information.  And among 10^20 malaria there surely were other beneficial mutations.  But we are not seeing radical diversification.

Given these rates of evolution how do you evolve mammals, given 200 million years and a cumulative population of 10^20 or so?  You would likely need tens of billions of beneficial mutations to account for such diversity.  This is a huge difference between what we see evolution doing in microbes and what it would have needed to do in the past.  Especially given the four reasons why microbes should evolve functional gains much faster, which I listed above.  So closing this gap is one thing I would need to see to convince me that natural processes are sufficient.

Does this mean I think evolution can account for all microbes?  Probably not.  There are far too many unknowns.  Between all the steps involved, what is the greatest amount of non-functional space would you need to traverse at once to get from pro- to eukaryotes?  3 nucleotides?  300?  This is the remote past and we have no way of knowing.  So that is why I am focusing on mammal evolution where there is more to know.

Also let's talk about [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/60kb39/creationists_you_need_to_get_your_stories_straight/).  ID people and creationists argue that there are too many deleterious mutations and not enough beneficial mutations.  You can't just conflate them all together and say ""too many or not enough mutations!""  You know this.  Why are you misrepresenting us?

&gt; Then there are Hox genes.

383,"&gt; Generally not since there are extensive barriers to inter-specific mating.

I remember [this paper](http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/vme/hgt/jbiosys18-2.pdf) suggesting that 40% of tunicates genes came from another organism (or rather the merging of organisms):  ""one group, containing about 40% of the proteins, supports the classical assemblage of the tunicate with vertebrates, while the remaining group places the tunicate outside of the chordate assemblage. The existence of these two phylogenetic groups is robustly maintained in five, six and nine taxa analyses. These results suggest that major horizontal gene transfer events occurred during the emergence of one of the metazoan phyla.""

As you can imagine we're skeptical that such a process could happen.  The abstracts of your symbiogenesis papers read:

1.  "" Lauterborn obtained its photosynthetic organelles by a similar but more recent process, which involved a different cyanobacterium, indicating that the evolution of photosynthetic organelles from cyanobacteria was not a unique event, as is commonly believed, but may be an ongoing process.""

1.  ""The chromatophore genome of P. chromatophora strain M0880/a was recently sequenced, revealing that its size (∼1 Mbp) has been reduced and that it lacks several genes important to cyanobacteria, including a few photosynthetic genes. Here, we obtained concrete evidence that psaE, one of the photosynthetic genes, is expressed from the nuclear genome of P. chromatophora. This indicates that the psaE gene has been transferred into the nuclear genome from the chromatophore.""

With beneficial mutations we regularly see them arising in the lab and in the wild, usually in microbes because of the numbers we've been discussing.  From that we can even make estimates of how often they occur.  These papers are very interesting, but I was hoping to be able to do the same for horizontal transfers as we do for beneficial mutations--to measure and quantify their rate.

409,"&gt;But first on Behe: I don't even use irreducible complexity arguments because I think there are too many unknowns. I think he's right about the areas of evolution he has explored, but his work is too specific to extrapolate. 

There's a lot of wiggle room there, but I'll take it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Behe has published at least two other papers since 2004. Not a lot but it's incorrect to say he hasn't published anything.

The first appears to be a review, and the second isn't a paper at all. It's the introductory remarks of a conference section chair. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Yes it does, but

Nothing after the but matters. The process exists, but it's not part of Behe's model. Therefore the model is not an appropriate tool to determine the rate at which the changes he's looking for can occur.

&amp;nbsp;

I beg your pardon, but the rest of your argument is nothing more than an argument from incredulity. ""I don't think these changes could happen fast enough."" Okay. But we watched them happen in the lab. And this is just one experiment. There's another very similar from a couple of years earlier (Barlow and Hall 2003, on cefepime resistance, I think), and the punch line from that one was that after documenting the novel forms of resistance in the lab, they actually appeared clinically a couple of years later. I can't say what the population size was, but it sure didn't take very long once the selective pressure was present. Then there's the LTEE, and *literally every experimental evolution experiment ever*. At some point, the weight of these experiments, done in small populations (relative to natural populations) over extremely short timespans has to make you wonder, right? Like, where exactly is the limit in terms of what can evolve?

&amp;nbsp;

I've also given you an example in nature in HIV-1 group M Vpu. *You* provided another with N-Vpu. Those are the types of changes that aren't supposed to be possible. 

Then there are Hox genes. 

[And an instance of primary endosymbiosis happening *right now*.](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(09\)00753-2) These are all large-scale changes. I mean, acquiring a new organelle? That involves extensive HGT between the large and small organisms, tons of new protein-protein interactions, revisions of massive gene networks, changes to defense mechanisms...and, again, because I want to emphasize, this, we're watching this happen *in real time*. There is no question of ""can this happen,"" or ""did this happen"". The answer is yes, and it's happening again *right now*. 

&amp;nbsp;

So rather than play whack-a-mole with each new example, each ""well process X couldn't happen fast enough,"" I have a single question: What, specifically, would convince you that natural processes are sufficient to generate extant biodiversity? ",8,1489981502,2017-03-19 23:45:02

On a related note, you don't need signature of a viral insertion to infer HGT. One dead giveaway is a different codon usage profile. If the codons within a gene or region differ significantly from most of the genes in the genome, that's a telltale that it's a horizontal acquisition. ",6,1489981059,2017-03-19 23:37:39

I misunderstood what you were saying above.  I thought you were saying animals would have more rapid adaptation because of recombination.

This isn't an example of observed evolution.  It's just counting the hox genes in different animals.  How do you get from that to an argument toward what evolution can do?  Files don't become worms when their hox genes get duplicated.

&gt;  Do you dispute that gene duplication counts as ""microevolution""?

I avoid the terms micro and macro-evolution because I don't think they are not well enough defined.  My argument, outlined [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/5zyfi2/im_an_evolutionary_biologist_ama/df5nttk/) is that evolution is too slow at finding and fixing useful mutations to account for animal evolution.",2,1489979591,2017-03-19 23:13:11

I don't quite understand what you're asking. ""Help"" evolution? If you mean ""facilitate more rapid adaptation,"" it works the same in both. You can't generalize a rule about ""how much"" it will help, since, especially with multipartite genomes, you get into questions of linked vs unlinked genes. Recombination allows for more rapid adaptive evolution, in everything.

416,"Ok this is good because now we are exploring one of the main reasons I reject evolutionary theory--I think microbial evolution, where we can watch far more generations, shows that evolution is way too slow.  And you are a microbiologist who focuses on evolution so that's great too.

------------------

But first on Behe:  I don't even use irreducible complexity arguments because I think there are too many unknowns.  I think he's right about the areas of evolution he has explored, but his work is too specific to extrapolate.  Also, Behe has published at least [two](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656902) [other](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_others03) papers since 2004.  Not a lot but it's incorrect to say he hasn't published anything.  

&gt; Behe's model simply assumes such a pathway out of existence.

Yes it does, but Behe is careful to explain this.  In Edge of Evolution Behe provides p. falciparum (human malaria) evolving resistance to the drugs pyrimethamine and adovaquone as examples of stepwise gains, and that these happen and spread far enough to be detected after about a trillion cell replications.  As opposed to the 10^20 for chloroquine resistance, which requires two mutations before a selective benefit is realized.

&gt; develop robust experimental support for the ideas he promotes in his books.

The first paper above is a review of a good number of microbial evolution experiments over the last few decades--he breaks down the beneficial mutations into categories of gain, modification, or loss of function.  

--------------

Ok, now on antibiotic resistance.  I read your paper.  Here is a [free version](https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/bme207/Fall09/Lecture%2013/Science%202006%20Weinreich.pdf) of it for anyone else interested.  I'm especially pleased that you picked a case where we are actually looking at specific mutations that improve the function of a gene.  So often when discussing antibiotic resistance I see examples where it's transmitted on a plasmid, or mutations are destroying a gene.

So how many bacteria does it take to evolve one of these 18 possible paths of 5 mutations?  I know with p falciparum evolves resistance to the drug pyrimethamine through a path of [four incremental mutations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715478/figure/F2/), and it takes about a trillion of them to do so:  ""[approximately 1 in 10^12](http://www.jci.org/articles/view/21682).""

Given this, how should we expect humans to evolve from an ancestral ape species?  There would be fewer than 1 trillion human ancestors since a chimp divergence.  And beneficial traits should be much harder to fix in our own populations than in bacteria.  Four reasons:  We have a far higher deleterious mutation rate than bacteria.  That means the majority of selection is spend removing deleterious alleles rather than promoting beneficial mutations with typically much smaller selection coefficients.  Our population sizes are much smaller, also weakening selection.  Recombination occurs at what, about once or twice per chromosome?  Such a massive amount of hitchhiking also impedes selection.  And having so many more nucleotides also decreases the average selection coefficient of mutations.

When we get into even larger microbial populations, I haven't seen much better.  With 10^11 HIV virus particles per person, 35 million people infected with HIV, and multiple HIV replication events, that's what, something like 10^20 HIV that have existed since the events when they first entered humans?  Judging by the lengths of the red lines in [figure 2 here](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~larget/Genetics629/Fall2009/hiv.pdf), we have about 5000 mutations that have fixed in the various HIV lineages during that time.  Let's generously assume all 5000 were beneficial.  Likewise we there would be about 10^20 mammals that evolved from a common ancestor over the last 200m years.  Bats, humans, whales, the platypus, and so on.  How do you do that in fewer than 5000 beneficial mutations, because of all the factors that makes their selection so drastically less efficient than HIV?  

&gt; there's a reason asexual animals don't stick around, and it isn't because they evolve slower.

I would guess it's because deleterious mutations accumulate faster whenever there's no recombination.  You tell me?

This is a good word to learn. It is EQUIVOCATE:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation

&gt;Equivocation (""to call by the same name"") is an informal logical fallacy. It is the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time). It generally occurs with polysemic words (words with multiple meanings).

&gt;What is light cannot be dark.

&gt; Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

Think about it.   It's a way to deceive or come up with bad ideas.

&gt;A boy can change a house by painting it

&gt;To change a house into a 747-jet liner, it requires change

&gt;since boys can change a house, they can change a house into a 747 jet liner

that would be totally bogus, but a lot of evolutionary claims follow the same rhetorical (not scientific) form.

This can also happen with plants, which [caused the Irish potato famine](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/agriculture_02).

423,"That is the claim, but the question is whether this is a reality.

The simplest way to understand the problem is to think of hacking someone's password.

If the password is one letter, it's not so hard.  Assuming an alphabet of say 26 letters, if you try 26 different letters, you'll eventually figure it out.

It becomes harder if we go to a two-letter password.  You will need to explore 26x26 = 26^2 = 676 attempts to guarantee you'll find the password.


If you go to 3-letter passwords it becomes

26x26x26 = 26^3 = 17,576 to guarantee you'll find the password

for 4-letter passwords
26x26x26x26 = 26^4 = 456,976 to guarantee you'll find the password

once you get up to a 20 letter password it will take

26^20 = 19,928,148,895,209,400,000,000,000,000 to ensure you'll find the password

So what does this have to do with macro evolution?  It is misleading to think that if evolution can solve a simple design problem (like a single-letter password), it can solve slightly hard design problems (a 20 letter password), and then really hard design problems (a 1000 100-letter passwords).

This is the problem with evolving proteins which have an alphabet of 20 letters called amino acids.  Proteins, like passwords require specific sequences in certain parts of the protein which are somewhat like passwords.

It's reasonable to think there are lots of proteins that have 30-letter ""passwords"".

A 30-letter protein ""password"" would require exploring

20^30 = 1,073,741,824,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

possible combinations.

There are some subtleties to this which requires understanding a little bit of chemistry and physics and molecular biology, but that is the gist of it.  It's not exactly that simple, and to know the exact details requires a bit more to learn than what I just said.

Macro evolution entails evolving new proteins that are radically different than the pre-existing set.  If the new protein only required a single-letter change from a pre-existing, not much problem, but if it requires a 30-letter change, the creature is out of luck.   There are possibly thousands of proteins that are unique to each complex species.   

We can selectively breed a potato to make smaller, or bigger potatoes, but we can't evolve them into rabbits.  That's partly because of the problem of evolving new proteins.

Hope that helps.

424,"I guess that depends what you mean by ""microevolution"" and ""macroevolution."" Yes, variation happens within species all the time, and species can split into multiple species. In theory, if this continues happening, then the species will be more and more varied, producing what I suppose you could call ""macroevolution."" However, there are a few caveats to this:

* Genetic variability tends to decrease over generations unless mutations introduce new variability. From what I can tell, the decrease in variability seems to outpace the rate of mutation, but evolutionists would doubtlessly say that it does not over long periods of time. I have heard other creationists describe this as a directional difference: microevolution is a downward spiral, whereas macroevolution requires an upward trend, so more of the former does not lead to the latter.
* As creationists, we believe that the diversity of life is at least partially accounted for by divine creation rather than totally by evolutionary processes, regardless of whether macroevolution or universal common ancestry is possible.

The terms ""microevolution"" and ""macroevolution"" are too vague and misleading, I think, whether discussing the subject with creationists or with evolutionists. I tend to avoid the terms altogether. Instead, I use a consistent definition for ""evolution"": a shift in allele frequencies within a population over time.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding self-assembly, it probably didn't start with DNA. It was probably RNA, which is pretty similar but a bit more chemically reactive, and therefore more likely to assemble. RNA is important because it can store information like DNA, but it can also catalyze reactions like proteins. 

&amp;nbsp;

Under realistic early-earth conditions, RNA monomers self-assemble in sequences long enough to have biochemical activity. The sequences are random, but if you generate a lot of them (like millions-to-billions a lot), some are going to be functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

Because DNA is more stable, we think that once this system existed, it was beneficial to use DNA as the ""storage"" molecule (in other words, selection favored entities that used DNA and RNA over those with just RNA), since it is less prone to mutation compared to RNA.

469,"Well, a couple of things.

First, it's *at least* four mutations in the Vpu gene *of one lineage* of HIV. It's a heck of a lot more than four total mutations between SIVcpz and HIV-1 group M taken as a whole. Then there are the far smaller populations of HIV-1 groups N, O, and P, plus HIV-2. There are a lot of required mutations happening pretty rapidly here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, I'm glad we agree that even Behe's pessimistic estimates are no actual barrier to microbial evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

Third:

&gt;Animals have a much much lower per nucleotide mutation rate than HIV so it would take far more animals to do the same.

Animals also have far larger genomes, so on a per-replication basis, you actually get way more mutations than HIV. Many of these are swiftly corrected, since animals have way more sophisticated error-checking and DNA repair mechanisms than retroviruses, but let us not ignore genome size. And as I've said a few times, animals are diploid, do homologous recombination, etc etc etc. So you don't need to get five random mutations all in a sequence. They can appear in different individuals simultaneously and become associated via recombination. You can't write this off because Behe excludes it from his model. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fourth, the important things here are the mechanisms. You are in effect making an argument based on the micro/macro distinction. But you have acknowledged micro-scale changes and therefore implicitly the mechanisms that cause them. 

But it's these same mechanisms operating over longer timespans that generate macro-scale change. For example, gene duplication can permit a wider range of metabolic processes. It can also result in higher-order developmental complexity, when the genes duplicated are hox or hox-like genes for transcription factors. [So you go from a tubular body to a segmented one.](http://www.mun.ca/biology/desmid/brian/BIOL3530/DB_05/fig5_12.jpg) Is there a mechanism that would preclude such processes from generating large-scale changes over long periods of time?

In this example, you can see one of the specific shortfalls of Behe's model - prohibiting beneficial intermediates. [This figure](https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/312/5770/111/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1) illustrates the possible pathways from zero to five resistance mutations, with increasing levels of resistance at every step. Behe's model simply assumes such a pathway out of existence. 

Yes, you can absolutely say ""well that isn't the mechanism Behe is trying to model."" **Exactly**. Behe *isn't* trying to model a realistic set of evolutionary processes. And that's why his model is pretty close to worthless. 

&amp;nbsp;

Separately...

&gt;which has been Behe's criticism for the last 20 years.

...this is why I don't think Behe is a good scientist. He's been complaining about the same thing for over two decades, has published *one* paper, 13 years ago, that kinda-sorta takes a stab at addressing it, and just ignores a ton of work that is *actually* relevant to the question. Meanwhile, he's written a few popular-level books on that same topic, without doing the hard to work to a) learn enough about the thing he's commenting on to be credible to specialists in the field, or b) develop robust experimental support for the ideas he promotes in his books. 

And he's been asked why he hasn't done this kind of work, during the Dover trial. His answer? ""It would not be fruitful.""

This from someone who has made a career of trying to convince non-biologists that these ideas have merit, while making almost no effort to convince biologists of the same. He claims his ideas are scientific, that they are testable, and that they are correct, but he has decided not to do the work to demonstrate any of these things are the case. Putting aside ""correct,"" he could do *a single* well-designed experiment to demonstrate they are rigorous, testable scientific concepts. But he has declined to do so.

477,"&gt; So we can confidently say that at least four specific changes from SIVcpz-Vpu to HIV-1 group M Vpu are required for tetherin antagonism in humans. 

Ok good, I wanted to establish the numbers before going further. Behe wrote in his 2007 book, [Edge of Evolution](https://books.google.com/books?id=zm_NoZ6_AZoC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22to+generate+all+possible+six-nucleotide+mutations+in+HIV%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidzau_yODSAhVBwYMKHUhgDiMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22to%20generate%20all%20possible%20six-nucleotide%20mutations%20in%20HIV%22&amp;f=false):  ""So to generate all possible six-nucleotide mutations in HIV would require only 10^20 viruses, which have in fact appeared on earth in recent decades.""

That's six versus your four, but here we're talking about RNA viruses and not animals.  Above I specifically said that ""5-7 nucelotides of non-functional space"" was a gap too large for *animal* populations to cross.""  Animals have a much much lower per nucleotide mutation rate than HIV so it would take far more animals to do the same.

Behe goes on to incorrectly state "" In 10^20 copies, HIV developed nothing significantly new or complex.""  In the debate I mentioned above, Ian Musgrave pointed out this was mistaken because of Vpu, and Michael Behe acknowledged that he was mistaken.  But four coordinated mutations is still less than the six Behe estimated for HIV.

478,"I remember reading a paper arguing that sex reduces genetic variation and [slows down evolution](http://ge.tt/4ySqP5L/v/0):

1.  ""Sex is usually perceived as the source of additive genetic variance that drives eukaryotic evolution vis-à-vis adaptation and Fisher's fundamental theorem. However, evidence for sex decreasing genetic variation appears in ecology, paleontology, population genetics, and cancer biology. The common thread among many of these disciplines is that sex acts like a coarse filter, weeding out major changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements (that are almost always deleterious), but letting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral), flow through the sexual sieve. Sex acts as a constraint on genomic and epigenetic variation, thereby limiting adaptive evolution. The diverse reasons for sex reducing genetic variation (especially at the genome level) and slowing down evolution may provide a sufficient benefit to offset the famed costs of sex.""

So I don't think it's valid to say that being sexual will speed up evolution overall.

Therefore it wouldn't make sense for Behe model all of these other processes if it makes animals worse than prokaryotes.  But let's not ignore this part of the paper:  ""but letting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral), flow through the sexual sieve"" since that's what Behe's paper *is* about.

Behe's paper is about getting two mutations to evolve a binding spot.  This is the type of evolution needed to evolve complex molecular machines, which has been Behe's criticism for the last 20 years.  These nucleotides close together so recombination is unlikely to be of much help--especially in humans but even in bacteria.  I am assuming the diagram you shared is assuming the two nucleotides are not near each other.

So yes I agree this paper from Behe has limited scope in the evolution debate.  The part I find very compelling is that in our microbial disease studies even among all these microbial populations exposed to various selective pressures, we see so little evolution.  We've talked about some of this before.  Put together some numbers if you disagree?  With estimated population sizes and the number of beneficial, non-destructive mutations fixed by selection.

485,"Sticking with Behe for now, the problem is that he does exactly what you say here:

&gt;On the rest, Behe's paper isn't trying to model the entire evolutionary process, just one specific type of mutation. 

Fair enough. But then, as you say:

&gt;he argues that if takes this many microbes to stumble upon and fix evolutionary gains, then a much smaller population of humans should not be able to evolve two-step-without-intermediate gains at all.

But that's *exactly* the problem I'm articulating. He's using a model that is oversimplified *for prokaryotes* and then drawing conclusions for humans, which, as sexual, diploid organisms, have even more complex mechanisms in play. It's completely unreasonable to draw the conclusions he does from that paper. It actually supports the *exact opposite conclusion*, showing how quickly these kinds of processes can act in real-world populations. 

""Well prokaryotic populations are bigger than human populations.""

Yup. But we're diploid and sexual, so we're better and linking to different beneficial alleles together. You can't make the argument that these mechanisms operate too slowly in humans for our evolution to be possible. There are other mechanisms at play that this model ignores.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Can you link me to some context for this graph?

The vertical axis is frequency, so the thickness of each color indicates the percentage of the population with that genotype. In the upper panel, there's recombination, so when the aB and Ab strains meet, the beneficial AB genotype rapidly appears and becomes dominant.

In the lower panel, there's no recombination, so each mutation has to occur in sequence to get the AB genotype. So the aB lineage gets outcompeted by Ab (this is called clonal interference), and then the B mutation has to occur *within* the Ab lineage to arrive at AB. 

Behe's model operates as the lower panel illustrates. But *everything*, even haploid, asexual bacteria, operates as the top panel illustrates. Ignoring that mechanism invalidates his findings. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now there are of course hotspots and coldspots for recombination, particularly in the human genome (and probably generally in animal genomes). But we're talking every few thousand bases in a genome of almost three billion. That's still hundreds of thousands of hotspots littering our genome. And bacteria are less picky about where recombination occurs (it's often associated with integrated mobile genetic elements, unsurprisingly, but happens at a pretty robust background rate). So the argument doesn't hold for Behe's model. He's estimating the rate at which a *very limited* set of evolutionary process can generate a new trait, in a population that is *ten million times smaller* than that in a single ton of soil. There is no way these results can be used to draw broad conclusions about the rate or scope of evolutionary processes as a whole over time. It's completely without merit.

487,"Okay, let's see. 

Ah, you're looking at HIV-1 group N, which is super interesting, but different from HIV-1 group M, which is the pandemic group. N is highly geographically restricted and is much less transmissible. We actually think it appeared through a separate transmission event into humans in the first place (same with groups O and P). 

But anyway, the anti-tetherin mechanisms of M-Vpu and N-Vpu are different, and N-Vpus rely on a specific binding site in the transmembrane domain that requires the four amino acid substitutions to interact *specifically* with tetherin.

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's the full paper,](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003093) and here's the key section with regard to how many of these mutations are required for the baseline functionality:

&gt;To map the amino acid changes necessary for anti-tetherin activity in the TMD of N-Vpus, we analyzed eight different YBF30 and EK505 Vpu mutants (Figure 4A). The results revealed that four TMD amino acid substitutions (E15A, V19A, I25L and V26L) were sufficient to render the SIVcpz Vpu active against human tetherin, while the reciprocal changes disrupted the effect of the YBF30 Vpu on virus release (Figure 4B). 

So in HIV-1 Group N, it is four specific mutations required for tetherin antagonism, via a completely different mechanism than HIV-1 Group M. Good find. 

&amp;nbsp;

But let's return to Group M. [Here's a rundown](http://jvi.asm.org/content/84/14/7124.full) of what parts of VPU are required for tetherin antagonism. They narrowed down the activity to requiring a few specific regions of Vpu (AAs 1-8 and 14-22, [see figure 5](http://jvi.asm.org/content/84/14/7124/F5.large.jpg)), and documented that you could induce tetherin antagonism in SIVcpz-Vpu by giving it *both* domains (but not just one of them). They then compared these regions of M-Vpu to the same regions of the SIVcpz strains most closely related to HIV-1 group M, and identified seven amino acid substitutions required to confer tetherin antagonism. Now, what I would *like* to have seen from this team was an series of single-AA alanine substitutions for each site within those two regions, or single-AA substitutions with the M-Vpu AA in the SIVcpz version, to document the exact, specific requirements. 

...And that's what we get [here, sort of.](http://jvi.asm.org/content/84/24/12958.full) This study isn't as comprehensive as I would like, since it only looked at the 14-22 region, but they identified three specific amino acids that are required (one of them ""to a lesser extent,"" i.e. the magnitude of the loss of activity was less for that substitution) for Vpu-mediated tetherin antagonism. Given that we know the 1-8 region is also required, we can infer that there is at least one more required amino acid there (though it's almost certainly more than that, based on the alignments with SIVcpz-Vpu in the previous study). So we can confidently say that at least four specific changes from SIVcpz-Vpu to HIV-1 group M Vpu are required for tetherin antagonism in humans. ",5,1489842980,2017-03-18 09:16:20

This is very widely accepted among physicists who study fine tuning.  Although with some types of fine tuning we don't know the range of possible values, or have a way of knowing.

&gt; Is there an experiment, a measurement, an observation?

Papers that study fine tuning are full of models and simulations.  They calculate what universes would be like if the numbers were different, even creating graphs showing the acceptable ranges as several parameters ate change at a time.  This is the same type of modelling that was used to estimate the mass of the higgs boson, which was later used to find it.

&gt; multiverses

If we exist one universe among a large set of universes where life is possible, it's unexpected that our universe will also have other nice things like the fine structure constant.  And there's also the Boltzmann brain problem with multiverses.  So I think design is still a better explanation.

&gt;  If you want to go all in on a fine tuning argument, be my guest, but I'm not buying. 

It's fine if we agree to disagree.  I'm just hoping to clear up some misconceptions about it.",2,1489812176,2017-03-18 00:42:56

497,"I remember reading and re-reading the debate about Vpu between Michael Behe and Ian Musgrave.  I've read a couple other papers on it as well, but it's been a while.  I do agree that this Vpu feature is newly evolved.  But I have some questions about this before responding.

1.  You say: ""If this function is absent, HIV cannot infect human cells.""  But HIV-2 [doesn't even have a VPU gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2224584/):  ""The vpu gene is found exclusively in HIV-1 and some HIV-1-related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates, such as SIVcpz, SIVgsn, and SIVmon, but not in HIV-2 or the majority of SIV isolates""

2.  Do you have a source for ""seven amino acid substitutions"" ?  I tried googling but all I found was this paper claiming [there were four](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23308067/):  ""We found that these N-Vpus acquired four amino acid substitutions (E15A, V19A and IV25/26LL) in their transmembrane domain (TMD) that allow efficient interaction with human tetherin."".  I only read the abstract.

3.  Do you have a source for the amino acid substitutions all having to be present to have any function?

498,"Sorry, I don't buy any kind of fine tuning argument. The assumptions - that there is dichotomy of chance or design, that there are no multiverses, that there *couldn't* be a universe with any other constants, that there couldn't be life with any other constants, and so on - are too much for me to accept, with absolutely no evidence. We have a sample size of 1, and we haven't even figured out that one yet, so we don't have a strong basis to conclude what *could* be possible or what *must* be the case. If you want to go all in on a fine tuning argument, be my guest, but I'm not buying. ",8,1489810196,2017-03-18 00:09:56
499,"Depends on the situation. If you have something that has an *incidental* function, I'd think it's still vestigial. For example, the idea that the appendix harbors bacteria that can repopulate our intestines after antibiotic treatment. That's pretty incidental, and wouldn't be a function at all prior to 1928. So that's still vestigial. 

&amp;nbsp;

You can also have genes or structures that did one thing, lost that function (i.e. became pseudogenes, in the case of genes), but then later gained a different function. I think this is closer to exaptation, but I can see why they might be called vestigial in the context of the ancestral function.

&amp;nbsp;

And then finally you have cases where there are functions the whole time, but we didn't know it. This is just a functional structure, not vestigiality. ",7,1489809886,2017-03-18 00:04:46
