0,I want to settle this once and for all: Creationists have no way of quantifying the information needed for anything to evolve. Prove me wrong for a SINGLE protein.,19,True,"Here's the game: Creationists (okay, just one for our purposes, /u/johnberea) claim that information in the genome accumulates too slowly via evolutionary processes for those processes to explain extant life. 

This is bunk because they (he) have no way of quantifying that information. ""Functional nucleotides"" is the metric that is provided, but nobody can actually tell me how many ""functional nucleotides"" are present in a genome. 

If that last sentence is wrong, prove it. 

Tell me *exactly* how much information, in terms of ""functional nucleotides"", is present in human myoglobin.

[Here's the gene sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4151) (and from there you can access the amino acid sequence).

4,Is Evolution unreasonably effective?,0,True,"Mathematics has been described as **unreasonably effective** in describing the observable universe.

And thus that notion has driven philosophers to try to understand why a product of the human consciousness (ie mathematics) should be so ""unreasonably effective"" in describing something that was not created by human consciousness (ie the rest of the observable universe).

And - therefore - one possible explanation is that **both** mathematics and Reality are products of consciousness - and thus there must indeed be a connectivity between human-level consciousness and the divinely creative levels of consciousness.

Similarly Evolution has proved to be unreasonably effective in creating the vast array of life on this one planet - whilst it appears to have been completely ineffective everywhere else we have observed - from the Moon to the distant exoplanets and galaxies.

And thus it is indeed reasonable to ask why it has proven so unreasonably effective only in the place that harbors observable conscious life.

And therefore one would expect the connection between consciousness and evolution to be more actively pursued and studied.

And yet the irony is that Scientists use their very consciousness in study to assert that consciousness has no real place in Reality itself.

This is indeed a puzzle for any forward thinking Scientist.",1521713432,55,2018-03-22 06:10:32

[The first post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/85iizk/science_confirms_genesis_flood_account_again/) is from WND, arguing that scientists have found water trapped within diamonds in the mantle, therefore the story of Noah's Flood has been confirmed.

[The second post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8593xq/kent_hovind_100_reasons_why_evolution_is_stupid/) is a video of Kent Hovind giving reasons why evolution is stupid. Hovind is notorious for lying through his teeth (he has a doctorate, for example, but it's from a degree mill that gives anyone a degree) and he taught high school science (but no one can point out where he ever taught), and the video is no exception to this.

The creation subreddit is becoming an increasingly absurd joke of creationism, mostly due to its desire to stay a safe space for creationists on Reddit. They want only people who agree with their ideologies there, and posts like those show that they'll even accept absurd arguments so long as they promote creationist beliefs.

If any posts like those supporting evolution were to pop up in /r/evolution, they would most likely get downvoted to hell and the posts' authors shamed for being so gullible.

9,"Creationist Claim: Mammals would have to evolve ""functional nucleotides"" millions of times faster than observed rates of microbial evolution to have evolved. Therefore evolution is false.",12,True,"Oh this is a good one. This is u/johnberea's go-to. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/82e5ww/convince_me_that_observed_rates_of_evolutionary/dvau38h/) a representative sample:

&gt;1.  To get from a mammal common ancestor to all mammals living today, evolution would need to produce likely more than a 100 billion nucleotides of function information, spread among the various mammal clades living today.  I calculated that out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/82e5ww/convince_me_that_observed_rates_of_evolutionary/dvata10/).

&gt;2.  During that 200 million year period of evolutionary history, about [10^20 mammals](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6937/how-many-organisms-have-ever-lived-on-earth) would've lived.

&gt;3.  In recent times, we've observed many microbial species near or exceeding 10^20 reproductions.

&gt;4.  Among those microbial populations, we see only small amounts of new information evolving.  For example in about 6x10^22 HIV I've [estimated](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/observed-evolution/hiv/) that fewer than 5000 such mutations have evolved among the various strains, for example.  Although you can make this number more if you could sub-strains, or less if you count only mutations that have fixed within HIV as a whole.  Pick any other microbe (bacteria, archaea, virus, or eukaryote) and you get a similarly unremarkable story.

&gt;5.  Therefore we have a many many orders of magnitude difference between the rates we see evolution producing new information at present, vs what it is claimed to have done in the past.

&gt;I grant that this comparison is imperfect, but I think the difference is great enough that it deserves serious attention.

&amp;nbsp;

Response:

[Short version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4bftQ4xxFc)

Long version:

There are 3 main problems with this line of reasoning. (There are a bunch of smaller issues, but we'll fry the big fish here.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem the First:** Inability to quantify ""functional information"" or ""functional nucleotides"". 

I'm sorry, *how* much of the mammalian genome is ""functional""? We don't really know. We have approximate lower and upper limits for the *human* genome (10-25%, give or take), but can we say that this is the same for *every* mammalian genome? No, because we haven't sequenced all or even most or even a whole lot of them. 

Now JohnBerea and other creationists will cite a number of studies purporting to show widespread functionality in things like transposons to argue that the percentage is much higher. But all they actually show is biochemical activity. What, their transcription is *regulated* based on tissue type? The resulting RNA is *trafficked* to specific places in the cell. Yeah, *that's what cells do*. We don't just let transcription happen or RNA wander around. Show me that it's actually doing something for the physiology of the cell. 

Oh, that hasn't been done? We don't actually have those data? Well, that means we have no business assigning a selected to function to more than 10-12% of the genome right now. It also means the numbers for ""functional information"" across all mammalian genomes are made up, which means everything about this argument falls apart. The *amount* of information that must be generated. The *rate* at which it must be generated. How that rate compares to observed rates of microbial evolution. It all rests on number that are made up.

(And related, what about species with *huge* genomes. Onions, for example, have 16 *billion* base pairs, over five times the size of the human genome. Other members of the same genus are over 30 billion. *Amoeba dubia*, a unicellular eukaryote, has over *half a trillion*. If there isn't much junk DNA, what's all that stuff doing? If most of it *is* junk, why are mammals so special?)

So right there, that blows a hole in numbers 1 and 5, which means we can pack up and go home. If you build an argument on numbers for which you have no backing data, that's the ballgame.

&amp;nbsp;


**Problem the Second:** The ecological contexts of mammalian diversification and microbial adaptation ""in recent times"" are completely different.

Twice during the history of mammals, they experienced an event called *adaptive radiation*. This is when there is a lot of niche space (i.e. different resources) available in the environment, and selection strongly favors adapting to these available niches rather than competing for already-utilized resources. 

This favors new traits that allow populations to occupy previously-unoccupied niches. The types of natural selection at work here are directional and/or disruptive selection, along with adaptive selection. The overall effect of these selection dynamics is selection for *novelty*, new traits. Which means that during adaptive radiations, evolution is happening *fast*. We're just hitting the gas, because the first thing to be able to get those new resources wins. 

In microbial evolution, we have the exact opposite. Whether it's plasmodium adapting to anti-malarial drugs, or the *E. coli* in Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment, or phages adapting to a novel host, we have microbial populations under a *single* overarching selective pressure, sometimes for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of generations. 

Under these conditions, we see rapid adaption to the prevailing conditions, followed by a sharp decline in the rate of change. This is because the populations rapidly reach a fitness peak, from which any deviation is less fit. So stabilizing and purifying selection are operating, which *suppress* novelty, slowing the rate of evolution (as opposed to directional/disruptive/adaptive in mammals, which accelerate it). 

JohnBerea wants to treat this microbial rate as the speed limit, a hard cap beyond which no organisms can go. This is faulty first because quantify that rate oh wait you can't okay we're done here, but also because the type of selection these microbes are experiencing *is going to suppress the rate at which they evolve*. So treating that rate as some kind of ceiling makes no sense. And if *that* isn't enough, mammalian diversification involved *the exact opposite dynamics*, meaning that what we see in the microbial populations just isn't relevant to mammalian evolution the way JohnBerea wants it to be. 

So there's another blow against number 5. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem the Third:** Evolution does not happen at constant rates. 

The third leg of this rickety-ass stool is that the rates at which things are evolving today is representative of the rates at which they evolved throughout their history. 

Maybe this has something to do with a misunderstanding of molecular clocks? I don't know, but the notion that evolution happens at a constant rate for a specific group of organisms is nuts. And yes, even though it isn't explicitly stated, this *must* be an assumption of this argument, otherwise one cannot jump from ""here are the fastest observed rates"" to ""therefore it couldn't have happened fast enough in the past."" If rates are not constant over long timespans, the presently observed rates tell us nothing about past rates, and this argument falls apart. 

So yes, even though it isn't stated outright, constant rates over time *are* required for this particular creationist argument to work.

...I'm sure nobody will be surprised to hear that evolution rates are *not* actually constant over time. Sometimes they're fast, like during an adaptive radiation. Sometimes they're slow, like when a single population grows under the same conditions for thousands of generations. 

And since rates of change are not constant, using present rates to impose a cap on past rates (especially when the ecological contexts are not just different, but complete opposites) isn't a valid argument. 

So that's another way this line of reasoning is wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's so much more here, so here are some things I'm not addressing:

Numbers 2 and 3, because I don't care and those numbers just don't matter in the context of what I've described above.

Number 4 because the errors are trivial enough that it makes no difference. But we could do a whole other thread just on those four sentences.

Smaller errors, like ignoring sexual recombination, and mutations larger than single-base substitutions, including things like gene duplications which necessarily double the information content of the duplicated region and have been extremely common through animal evolution. These also undercut the creationist argument, but they aren't super specific to this particular argument, so I'll leave it there. 

&amp;nbsp;

So next time you see this argument, that mammalian evolution must have happened *millions of times faster* than ""observed microbial evolution,"" ask about quantifying that information, or the context in which those changes happened, or whether the maker of that argument thinks rates are constant over time. 

You won't get an answer, which tells you everything you need to know about the argument being made. ",1521161646,249,2018-03-15 20:54:06
10,Faint Young Sun Paradox,5,True,"IrrationalIrritation and I agreed here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/840jhm/the_evolutionary_history_of_the_sickle_cell/dvnsfbg/

to me starting a discussion on the Faint Young Sun Paradox.  The Faint Young Sun Paradox suggests to the creationists that the fossil record is not that old.  

If the fossil record is not that old, then the patterns of similarity and diversity in biology are likely by design, not common descent and transformation by evolution, since there wouldn't be enough time to evolve things from a common ancestor.

It also suggest re-visiting other clocking methods to date the Earth.  In principle these clocks could be observed over time to see if they agree with YEC predictions.  Granted it may take a few thousand years to see some of the clocks tick, but in principle, it is a formally testable hypothesis.  There may be some clocks that are trackable in far less time.  Some YECs have suggested magnetic field studies of the planets, for example...

Astronomer Emeritus at a secular University, who happened to be a YEC, Danny Faulkner wrote:

http://www.icr.org/article/young-faint-sun-paradox-age-solar-system/

&gt;Supposedly the Sun has been a main-sequence star since its formation about 4.6 billion years ago. This time represents about half the assumed ten-billion-year main-sequence lifetime of the Sun, so the Sun should have used about half its energy store. This means that about half the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been used up and replaced by helium. This change in chemical composition changes the structure of the core. The overall structure of the Sun would have to change as well, so that today, the Sun should be nearly 40% brighter than it was 4.6 billion years ago. 

&gt;This obviously has consequences for the temperatures of the planets. It is generally believed that even small fluctuations in the Sun's luminosity would have devastating consequences on Earth's climate. A 40% change in solar luminosity should have produced dramatic climatic changes, changes perhaps comparable to the current differences between Venus, Mars, and Earth. According to evolution, about four billion years ago when life supposedly first arose on Earth, the temperature had to have been close to what the temperature is today. But if that were the case, the subsequent increase in the Sun's luminosity would have made Earth far too hot for life today. One could naively suggest that Earth began cooler than it is today and has been slowly warming with time. But this is not an option because geologists note that Earth's rock record insists that Earth's average temperature has not varied much over the past four billion years, and biologists require a nearly constant average temperature for the development and evolution of life. This problem is called the early faint Sun paradox. 


The point is, even if we suppose a mechanism like Global Warming by greenhouse gasses or moon warming by moon orbits, everything has to be miraculously fine tuned or else the Earth becomes an ice ball or becomes too hot for life.

The paradox has been claimed and disputed to have been resolved.  But even the claims of a solution require miraculous fine tuning.  It is a known paradox in the secular world, it is not something the YECs came up with, but rather co-opted from the evolutionists (pun intended).

One objection was given here by denisova:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7syy9g/how_big_of_a_gap_would_overturn_evolution_in_your/dt8wxvi/

The problem is that denisova assumes the millions of years of Earth evolution to begin with.  That is circular reasoning.  Not to mention, Earth evolution with a moon system is also rather a miraculous claim. 

So, yes, one might accept evolution of the Earth, the moon, and the fossil record, but ironically it requires statistical miracles.

There is more than just gravity needed to make a functional planet.

I was once an evolutionist, then an OEC.  But then I read the following book which argued for solar system evolution.  It had the opposite effect on me as it highlighted all the unusual events need to evolve a solar system along with LOTS of anomalies.  After reading it, I made me doubt the Solar System evolved at all, but rather it seemed a miracle created it not too long ago.

I read the book almost 14 years ago.  It transformed many of my views, ironically, toward YEC:

https://www.amazon.com/Solar-System-Evolution-New-Perspective/dp/0521675669

This thread isn't the final word.  As I said earlier, there are testable hypotheses with the clocks YECs invoke, and maybe someday I can write a review of them and their status.....

Now, are miracles and God possible?  I suggested, based purely on physics, particularly Quantum Mechanics, that secular literature says the God hypothesis is one solution to the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics:

http://creationevolutionuniversity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=161

So I've suggested a Designer, and clocks that could confirm the YEC model, one of them being the Faint Young Sun Paradox.",1520993074,95,2018-03-13 22:04:34
11,Questioning the validity of Mammalia ear evolution,4,True,"https://youtu.be/6jrguc_oXuA

Script:



The evolution of the mammalian ear was originally thought to originate from a common ancestor of synapsids and sauropsids, but eventually passed on over generations of descendent modifications going from synapsids to stem groups of mammals, down into true mammals. This line of reasoning is based on the homology of the 3 ossicle bones: the mallius, the incus, and stapes. Because the common ancestor of the two clades happen to have 1 of the 3 ossicles appearing homologous, the stapes, it follows that the same ancestral ear has diverged to mammal-like reptiles and reptile animals, including birds. Thus, it logically follows as a monophyletic trait, meaning the ear system is ancestral sharing a common origin.  

On the contrary, there appears to be a gap in the fossil record that puts this into question. In 1975 an influential paper written by Allin reported that the tympanic membrane did not actually exist in the common ancestor of synapsids and sauropsids. It was also found to be lacking in stem groups as well. He found that even though they had massive stapes, it seemed to play a role more on the jaw/skull than it did on air-sound vibrations. 

This means that the eardrums found in amniota appeared independently. Meaning that the ears of reptiles/birds and the ears of mammalian-like animals do not share a common origin that can be traced by the lines of common descent. 

If modern mammals, reptiles and birds truly did evolve from a common ancestor with a tympanic ear, it would safe to say that other structures like the external ear canal and tympanic membrane would form in the same way in the different groups. Unfortunately, that is not what the fossil record nor comparative anatomy demonstrates.

One such characteristic that separates mammalian ears from non-mammalian amniota is the structure of the external ear cannal. In one study which involved mice and chicks, researchers were interested in studying its position and how it developed. What they found was that the ear canal of chicks actually developed above the jaw joint while in mammals like mice, it developed below the jaw joint. Here, there are two different developmental pathways that are in no way similar.

Another interesting part that makes the distinction more profound is the positioning of the tympanic membrane between mammals and non-mammals. In birds and reptiles, the tympanic membrane is found to be supported by the quadrate, that is the upper jaw region while in mammals it is supported on the tympanic ring, that is lower jaw region.

What we have here; therefore, is convergence independently appearing across different groups. While evolutionists like to point out to similarities like the 3 ossicle bones, they ignore differences such as the different positionings of tympanic membrane and external ear canal. To argue that the evolution of the mammalian ear was transitioned from a single ossicle is therefore, unjustified.""

14,Kent hovind vs aron ra debate,12,True,"https://youtu.be/gEKltaQ5HlA

This is a must see. Aron wipes the floor with kent. Kent really shows just how uneducated and misleading he is in this debate. 

Key moments of the debate

1. Aron called kent out for saying evolution teaches that we came from a rock. He explained how kent continuously says this even though he has been proven wrong. He asks kent to fix his error and admit he is wrong. He doesnt, and gives no explanation as to where he got the idea that evolution says we came from rocks. He tries to say its because oxygen escaped from cooling rocks which eventually helped form amino acids necessary fir life, aron explains that this doesnt mean the oxygen was actually part of the rock itself but was simply trapped inside of it. He explains that amino acids arent minerals, kent still wont admit he is wrong, keeps saying evolution teaches that we came from rocks. 

2. Kent wont define what a kind is after being asked repeatedly. First he says that the bible describes that a kind can only give forth after its own kind, but he admits a kind can speciate to the point that the grouos within the kind can no longer reproduce with eachother, in otherwords he admitted to macroevolution. Aron tries to explain this to him and that this is how evolution works, that kinds evolve into other kinds of that kind. 

3. Kent wont define what a kind is, wont give examples to meet arons phylogeny challenge, wont admit why he believels evolution teaches that we came from a rock but he also wont admit he is wrong about it. He keeps avoiding questions and derailing the conservation. For example when asked if mlmmoths and elephants are the same kind or are two different created kinds he avoids the question and says if a planet is made out of the same element as another planet then does that prove the planets share a common ancestor and when asked again he says idk but i know pine trees and ekephants arent the same kind. Aron responds that actually both elephants and pine trees are eukaryotic and therefore are related because they are both still eukaryotes. 

4. Kent makes the claim, multiple times, that phylogenetics is just scientists drawing lines on a paper linking random animals together for with no rhyme or reason to why they are drawing the line. He literally says scientists just decide it. Aron tries to explain that they dont just decide to draw lines to connect lineages because they feel like it, but because of evidence in genetic research and anatomical analysis and that the shared characteristics show inherited traits, not just similar traits. 

5. Aron clearly shows kent that evolution isnt a religion yet kent still keeps calling it a religion. 


During the entire debate kent didnt give a single piece of evidence for creationism. He just kept repeating that evolutionists rely on faith to assume that common traits between organisms means its related and that evolution is a religion. He kept repeating that just because a pine tree and an elephant are both eukaryotes that we shouldnt assume they are related. That was pretty much it. 

Aron confronted kent on a number of lies and claims he makes and clearly showed him why he was wrong but he woukdnt admit he was wrong. He asked multiple times to define kinds but he couldnt do it. He wouldnt answer any of the hard hitting questions but came out thinking he won the debate.",1520748800,22,2018-03-11 01:13:20

&gt;we should look at actual cases of adaptation and see how long this stuff takes.

S/he then provided a few examples. However, it seems to me that simply citing examples is insufficient: in order to make this a persuasive argument for macroevolution some way of quantifying the rate of change is needed. 

I cannot find such a quantification and I explain [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8110jq/monthly_question_thread_ask_rdebateevolution/dv1d31b/) why the response given by TalkOrigins doesn't really satisfy me.

Mathematically, taking time depth, population size, generation length, etc into account, can we prove that what we observe today is sufficient to explain the evolutionary changes seen in the fossil record?

This is the kind of issue that frustrates me about the creation-evolution debate because it should be matter of simple mathematics and yet I can't find a real answer.

20,Chatting with a creationist part 2,8,True,"Hey everyone. Thankyou for your time. I made a post a few days ago about my conversations with a creationist and i got some very helpful and detailed responses. This post will be extending from that and i had a few questions about what he is saying and i am interested to hear your thoughts on his. Thankyou. Below is my response to him after his message that can be found in part one. After that is his most recent reply. 

**My Response**

&gt; She rejected the first because of her years of studying Palaeontology.

Again, she did not reject it. She found it the least likely of her three hypothesis due to her knowledge of the overwhelming evidence against it. Of which her study of palaeontology was an influence. 

&gt; this field has foundational worldview assumptions.

No. Fields do not have worldviews. People have worldviews. 

&gt; They are philosophical naturalism and materialism, and uniformitarianism.

Scientists assume methodological naturalism. Which is different from philosophical naturalism. They do not assume philosophical materialism. We do assume Uniformitarianism. Because it is a clever assumption to make, that works. Creationists often assert that real scientists have no justification for assuming that physical laws are constant over time, and therefore, any work which is based upon this assumption (such as radiometric dating) is invalid. In reality, this Creationist assertion is not just wrong twice over, but if it were valid, it would necessarily render all science (including the Creationist version) and learning a perfect and utter waste of time.

First, real scientists don't actually presume that physical laws are constant; rather, they presume that if physical laws really did change, that change would leave traces of itself which could be detected by an appropriate experiment or observation. As such, real scientists can and do look for evidence that physical laws have changed. Empirical observations have, in fact, established that the greatest possible change which could have occured in physical laws is on the order of 1 part in several billion over the gigayears-long lifetime of the Universe.

Second, if physical laws do change in an undetectable manner, how can you trust that anything is reliable? Perhaps gravity might become a repulsive force tomorrow morning. Perhaps the molecules of your Bible might have rearranged themselves, transforming it into a copy of The God Delusion when you weren't looking. Simply put, uniformitarianism is the simpler assumption — because assuming that everything can change as it pleases, without any evidence of these variations, is unnecessary and need not be believed to explain everything we know

These same assumptions that make sure we date fossils correctly also power nuclear reactors. And we sure got those assumptions correctly considering we understand nuclear power enough to control and harness it. 

&gt; Please list what you believe to be the best Observable and repeatable evidence from the mountains to which you refer, which is exclusive to your propositions..

Read a science book. The evidence comes from a variety of fields geology, palaeontology, astronomy, biology, physics etc. There are many easily accessible and understandable sources for laypeople such as ourselves to learn about such evidence. Here is a good place to start https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-do-we-know-earth-46-billion-years-old-180951483/ 

&gt; Dr Schweitzer did not confirm her third hypothesis by observing and repeating a natural process by which the tissue could be preserved. She crafted an artificial and controlled experiment, wherein the conditions were not what any reasonable person would expect to find naturally occurring.

Yes, im sure you know what is and is not reasonable in this context better than some of the worlds best palaeontologists. 

&gt; It was nothing remotely like the conditions under which the remains were found. 

You are wrong. iron is found in living blood and is known to bind to the biochemicals found in dead tissue, stabilizing the decay process. So as the iron compounds Schweitzer found to be highly preservative are directly found in dead tissue of organisms itself, her experiments were very precisely reflecting the conditions under which in fossils tissues may be preserved.

Moreover, Schweitzer let dead tissue decay in two different ways: with respectively without those iron compounds present. The specimens with iron compounds showed no decay even after 2 years while the other specimen was completely rotten away and decayed. Yet the specimens were kept at room temperature without any further treatment. So the decay rates were purposely observed under optimal conditions for decay and degradation. In fossils in situ, the ancient organic material was found preserved within and protected by mineralized bone tissue, thus protected from air, bacterial and other forces.

&gt; with that designed and controlled experiment, she was able to extend the potential preservation to a few years, not millions.

For reasons that i hope are obvious, she cannot exactly run the experiment for millions of years. She was able to extent the preservation to two years, and after this period, blood vessels soaked in iron rich hemoglobin were found to have zero signs of decay or degradation whatsoever. Where as the blood vessels soaked in a watery iron-free solution turned to mush in just three days. So its not that the vessels soaked in iron rich hemoglobin decayed after a period of two years. They did not degrade at all. 

&gt; How are the rock layers dated?

The unambiguous convergent consensus of an array of methodologies. Including thermoluminescence, electron spin resonance and dozens of radiometric dating methods. 

&gt; By radiometric dating processes, which depend upon assumptions which cannot be known by observation or repetition

The only assumption is modern uniformitarianism. Which is not only a clever assumption to make as i have expanded upon above. But a necessary one to learn anything about the past and make predictions about the future. You might as well call me crazy for being confident that the sun will rise tomorrow because it rose in the past. 

&gt; and have produced conflicting results?

What conflicting results ? The variety of radiometric dating methods are in overwhelming agreement. 

&gt; The presence of the soft tissue alone call the dates into questions.

No it does not, and you have been presented with enough evidence to know this by now. 

&gt; The assumptions are that we know the original conditions of the samples. We cannot. It assumes thew uniformity of decay rates.

Yes, and thats completely fine. 

&gt; It assumes that conditions did not change, affecting the samples. No one has directly observed anything that is assumed in dating.

Radiometric decay isn't influenced by anything except universal constants, which also don't change. By the same logic, is it silly for me to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow ? Because i cant prove that it didn't disappear during the night ? Furthermore we do not need to know the initial conditions of the samples. 

&gt; And there is enough data to question them, making them far from conclusive, and not observable or repeatable fact.

That is false. 

&gt; If there is a natural explanation, it must operate on natural laws and principles. it must be demonstratable, now.

Like, radiometric dating?

&gt; Dr Schweitzer did not find the conditions necessary for such a process present or evidence in the original setting for the samples. She did not establish such a process by carefully crafted experimentation.

Don't you think its quite the coincidence that near enough the entire field disagrees with you ?

&gt; I do operate on a set of assumptions, arising from a world view. So do you.

What assumptions do you think i operate on ? Im genuinely intrigued 

&gt; We all have the same data. We just interpret it differently, based on worldview.

Speak for yourself. I form my worldviews around the data. Not the other way around. The data speaks for itself. 

&gt; The questions becomes one of philosophy, and which worldview can best explain all that needs explained.

No, thats wrong. There is a world of difference between an explanation and a demonstrably true explanation. The ability to offer an explanation for an event is not impressive. Demonstrating that your explanations are true are what matters. 

&gt; Philosophical naturalism and materialism are wholly insufficient for the task.

Even if that was true. It would mean nothing. There is a tremendous amount of things that i am unable to offer a sufficient explanation for. That does not entitle me to make things up however. There is no shame in ignorance. Only when it is wilful or when it is spread, is it shameful. I dont know the answers to lots of questions, and thats fine. We're working on it. 

&gt; I pointed to Dr Lewontin's quote, because he is open about what drives the faith in the model first made popular by Darwin.

Lewontin (If he said that) can speak for himself. I consider myself an apistevist. This means that i consider faith to be the most dishonest position that someone can have, and i reject it. 

&gt; As one who believes in naturalistic and materialistic explanations, he admits there really is no observable and repeatable data to support it.

If he said that, he is wrong. 

&gt; No processes that can be observed in the here and now. 

If he said that, he is wrong. 

&gt; Just an a priori commitment to a philosophy that rejects out of hand the possibility of God

That does not describe me or the vast majority of naturalists. I will accept the possibility of a god once it has been demonstrated. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**His Reply**

She assumed it least likely because she is committed to a worldview. Though the evidence pointed away from thise assumptions, she could follow. 

You are correct. The people in the field have worldview assumptions.

No. They are committed to philosophical naturalism and materialism. Itnis nit.just thay they apply a method. They will not allow for the suoernatural. This is in spite of the insufficiency of the worldview to adequately explain what needs explaining.
Uniformitarianism does not work. Itnis imposed on the data. The presence of the tissue alone calls it into question. Rapid fossilization, and canyon forming on a smaller scale, and other things add to that.

There is no observable and repeatable data that would confirm uniformitarianism. Dating methods are based on assumptions about things which cannot be known.

There is no basis for the assertion that science and learning are a waste if dating methods are wrong. This is evidenced by the fact that people learn and do science all day without them.

All scientists depend on predictable laws.of nature, based on direct observations.
The fact that samples of known age are given widely varying dates calls the assumptions into question. Dating, with various methods, of samples from within meters of each other, yield wide dates. Observable events that offer rapid results, thought to have taken long periods, call think tk question. 

It is by their assumptions that they established thentests, and the results

I would agree that physical laws do not change, unless some force acts upon them. That is why the assumptions about dating must be rejected.

It is not assumption that powers reactors. Itnis the directly observable laws.

I have srudied. Agaun, please cite what yiu believe to be the best observable and repeatable evidence, exclusive to darwinian evolution

I do know that Dr Schweizer did not observe the natural process that allegedly cause the preservation. I know she crafted artificial and controlled experiments, and no where near what was necessary. I know she did not show that even hee contrived conditions existed where the samples were found. No degree is needed for that. 

Rock layers are dated based on assumption, not observable data
Assumptions cannot be the basis for determining fact about the ancient past. Original conditoons, decay rates, and consistent conditions are all assumptions. 

I believe the sum will rise tomorrow because of today. I cannot use assumptions to determine its origins.
I can make predictions about how long a candle will burn by observing it now. I cannot determine, as a matter of fact, how long it had been burning, prior to me entering the room.

I would encourage you to do sow research into the conflicting dating results, amd ancient dates for samples of known age, for a start. 

The soft tissues are not explained by the experiment, which was essentially an insufficient attempt to rescue a worldview. 

An appeal to authority, in the case of Dr Schweizer s colleagues, is not the basis for truth. 

If you accept naturalism and materialism as a sufficient cause for the universe, life, and the laws thay govern it, then you operate on thay worldview.

And my worldview is wholly supported by the data. The data does not speak at all.

Demonstrate life from non life by natural process Demonstrate the ordering of the universe hy natural laws, from nothing. 
Demonstrate nature authoring the laws that govern it. Demonstrate the natural process that adds new, not previously oresent5, info to Dna. Demonstrate matter alone giving rise to DNA. Demonstrate matter giving rise to immaterial realities like logic and reason. Demonstrate matter giving rise to consciousness.

I would agree that making stuff up is.not the way to go. The rest of your paragraph on this is simple condescension.

Lewiston did say it. And he did speak for the field. 

You cannot demonstrate natural and material.processes as an explanation, yet you accept them.",1520220144,12,2018-03-04 22:22:24
21,Tell me if you agree or disagree with this idea and explain why.,3,True,"Let's say there was a hypothetical person who decided to take a modern fish species and selectively breed them to produce descendants that resemble tetrapods in every possible way. Let's also say this person is immortal so that the time it would take to do this is a non issue. I do not believe that at any point however, any serious scientist would decide to call this person's creations tetrapods. Not because of any silly argument about how they are still the same ""kind"" as whatever fish they started out as, but rather, it would just be because the name ""tetrapod"" was already taken by a phylogenetic clade that already existed before this guy started his experiment.

23,A critical look at Intelligent Design: A (mostly) honest look at ID,4,True,"The A critical look at Intelligent Design, was posted on r/creation other day.

[Link to article.](https://philosophicalapologist.com/2017/07/09/a-critical-look-at-intelligent-design/)

[Link to thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/81gc6o/a_critical_look_at_intelligent_design/)

The author tries to argue for intelligent design through a critical lens. Or at least critical by the standards of your average ID proponent. To the writer's credit it does make more of an effort to address ID's critics than usual. I'd like to, in turn, critique the points made in the article.

&gt; It’s common for opponents to dismiss ID as religion, often because it has Young Earth Creationist (YEC) roots, and YEC is certainly religious in nature. This is a lazy option, as ID explicitly avoids identifying its designer, and this approach does not address ID’s arguments.

I suppose ID would not be defined as a religion, or religious. That is provided you take it only by its core definitions and statements. However, it would be very much accurate to say that ID is a large part of a religious movement, which is why it is refused to be a part of public education. It is also disingenuous to take YEC, strip it of all its positive religious claims, and then call it something else, which is exactly what ID is.

&gt; We seem quite capable at reliably inferring design produced by intelligent agents, almost without thinking. By experience we’ve learnt how to discriminate between artifacts produced by natural processes, and artifacts produced by human intelligence. It seems an almost intuitive process.

Perhaps it is intuitive. But here's the problem, it's not objective. That is the foremost scientific objection to the watchmaker argument. Seeing something and assuming design does not mean a thing, if you can't actually demonstrate that you came to that conclusion for good reasons. 

Furthermore, I do not believe that we intuitively ""detect"" design through complexity, and other traits IDists say is evidence of design. Rather I believe our intuition is the result of our understanding of developmental processes. We know what nature can do, and we know what humans can do. For example, you could take something very simple, like a coat of paint on a wall.  A coat of paint is little more than a coating of liquid. No more complex than a coat of water on a rock. Yet we understand that the former is designed, because we know nature couldn't cause that particular liquid to form that particular shape.

The latter example, of a coat of water on a rock, raises an interesting point about intuitively detecting design. It could be caused by a natural means, like rain, or an intelligent means, like someone spraying it with a hose. I would guess that if you were to ask people which it was, our intuition would fail to be as accurate as it would be for a watch. How then can we trust our intuition for life forms as well?

&gt; What about biological artifacts? We have a theory of how they might be produced by natural means. But they seem incredibly complex, and evolutionary theory hasn’t yet produced a convincing step-by-step explanation of how many (even most) biological features could have arisen.

Well, I would ask two questions to that. First, do you really need such an explanation to be convinced? And second, what do you mean by ""convincing""? I ask that, because even the detailed explanations we do have, such as those for an eye, are rejected by creationists on seemingly arbitrary grounds. I believe the opinion that they are not convincing is based on personal bias, rather than the quality of the explanations themselves.

Even though we don't have detailed pathways for most specific biological features, that doesn't mean we don't have a convincing explanation. As far as science is concerned, evolution by way of natural selection on natural genetic processes is a plausible means of evolving the life we see today. I maintain that if a creationist believes a feature needs a particular detailed explanation, they need to justify why the current ""catch all"" explanation does not suffice.

&gt; ID’s general approach is to try determine what properties of artifacts are associated *only* with design, and then identify these properties in biological features. The argument is as follows:

Right. ID will have to find objective features in biology that could only exist if they were designed. It's not enough to rely on intuition, or claim that a designer could have designed them. It has to be piece of evidence specific to design. Unfortunately for IDists, they haven't found such a thing. So far their attempts, with things like irreducibly complexity, specified complexity, ect. have failed to find either conclusive examples, or even workable definitions. At the moment, this desire for a feature that could only be designed is a hopeful hypothesis.

&gt; Complexity seems a good candidate as a design marker. Many of our human artifacts (e.g. a computer) are extremely complex.  But there are three major problems.

The problem there is the theory of evolution was developed in order to explain biological complexity. So far all evidence, through both real world observation and computer simulation, show that is capable of creating complexity. Complexity alone is not a sufficient example of a feature that could only be designed.

Thankfully the author does admit as such:

&gt; Finally, it is unclear how we could demonstrate only intelligent agents can produce such complexity.

-
&gt; Enter irreducible complexity (IC), which tries to address the third issue above. ID’s claim is that there are certain biological structures unable to be produced by natural processes, only by intelligence. A system is IC if it is “a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning” (Behe, 1996).

I will accept that, depending on the definition, IC would be a valid example of a feature that could only be designed. As Darwin himself said, if a feature couldn't be built my successive small steps it couldn't evolve. So far, I agree. But that is the minimum standard for a feature that I would call IC. Behe's definition, quoted above, is too simplistic. If a system requires a particular part to function now, it doesn't mean it always needed that part. For example, not every animal needs a heart or a brain to function, yet we would certainly die without either.

&gt; It has become common for ID proponents (initiated by Stephen Meyers) to frame their method of enquiry as an Inference to Best Explanation (IBE), largely (I think) to build a case for ID being a scientific explanation. IBE involves taking competing explanations (e.g. evolution vs ID) and deciding which one best fits the empirical data. It is particularly suitable for comparing hypotheses for non-repeatable events from the past.

The problem there is how IDists define ""best explanation"". Certainly the fact that ID posits the existence of a supremely intelligent and powerful being, causes it a significant disadvantage in being the ""best explanation"". Evolution doesn't allow itself that luxury, as we choose to develop our ideas only from mechanisms that are known to be plausible. IDists make this assumption, and dare I say this is a religious assumption. Because it's such a widely accepted idea they don't consider it warrants questioning. If you were to take an equally evidenced idea, like say advanced undetectable stealth nanobots created and controlled life, they would not tolerate that claim without question.

&gt; ID is often accused of being a “God-of-the-gaps” argument, which means invoking God for natural phenomena that science hasn’t explained.

&gt; Although this is a pejorative, it’s worth noting that there might well be genuine gaps in nature that could be empirically detectable. If so, these would suggest a supernatural designer.  The existence of such gaps is a legitimate question – the problem being demonstrating that such gaps exist as illustrated by the concept of irreducible complexity. Historically, many gaps have been closed, which has discredited this approach, and of course the supernatural element helps discredit gaps as science.

&gt; ID’s use of IBE neatly avoids the charge of being God-of-the-gaps. Rather, it is a comparison of competing hypotheses based on available empirical evidence.

The problem with god of the gaps is it is little more than a claim that if we don't know something about our natural history, then it must have been a god. It fails as an argument, mostly because it's not an inference to a best explanation. It doesn't try to take something without evidence, and replace it with an explanation with more evidence. It just says ""a god could have done this"", and leaves it at that. Considering a god is, by concept alone, something that could do anything, it is a meaningless claim.

My stance is that these are meaningless and arbitrary terms because the mechanism by which evolutionary change occurs is not actually different between any given levels of organization of life. 

So did these terms arise because speciation has been observed, so a distinction needed to be made that doesn’t allow for a single common ancestor? Do YECs consider micro vs macro evolution to be mechanistically different (if so, what is the proposed difference) or did they pick an evolutionary cut-off point that they felt best agreed with Genesis?

29,The vedic concept of evolution.,0,True,"I thought I would introduce you to another concept of evolution, that from the vedic scriptures, which is the concept of evolution of the soul.

According to the vedas the bodies do not evolve, but it is the soul that is evolving, the changing bodies on the outside are only what is visible, but the so called modern scientists or religious people cannot understand what is going on, since they do not know about the evolution of the soul that is within.

This means a soul inherits a material body according to its own level of evolution and according to its karma it evolves into higher forms of being or into lower forms of being.

Material bodies have the limited ability to adapt to other living conditions, but the bodies never change or morph into another form of material body, instead the soul will jump into another body if its evolution is high enough that it qualifies for a higher body. What we see then is death of the old body and a new body being born.

According to the veads the whole universe including ALL possible living species are created simultaneously at once and while the universe exists no species are created and no species go exstinct. The vedic scriptures are also not so vague on their own teachings, but in general give pretty exact numbers and lists on everything, for example the number of all existing species is 8,4 million in the entire universe, which even matches relatively with the estimated number by our scientists of all existing species (8,7 million): https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110823180459.htm
But this may be just a coincidence.

The vedic concept of evolution matches quite the scientific concept we have today with the big difference that the material bodies never change and it is just the soul that changes the bodies, which may lead to an observer who does not know of the soul to falsely conclude that the bodies somehow evolve, but that is not the case. The evolution of the soul goes also from aquatic -&gt; plants -&gt; insects -&gt; birds -&gt; mamals and finally humans. This also disproves creationists who also do not know of the soul and about reincarnation and about the evolution of the soul. In the vedic concept natural selection also takes place, but it is also guided by a higher power, such things as random do not exist, everything has cause and effect, only people who do not know that call it ""random"" or ""chance"". Any theory that uses ""random"" or ""chance"" is incomplete and therefore incorrect, you either know the definitive cause or you don't.

30,This whole creationist vs evolutionists debate is a logical fallacy.,0,True,"I just was pointed to this subreddid if I wanted to debate evolution, but what I found was that it is only about a false duality with creationists vs evolutionists.

The logical fallacy here is that two parties are postulated to exist only in this debate and that one is postulated to be correct and the other one incorrect, where the only task in this debate is to find out which party is right. All this is absurd since how do you know that are are only two parties involved and how you know one must be correct and the other one incorrect?

The reality is more likely that there are lots of different parties with lots of different hypotheses, where as multiple parties and multiple hypothesis can be right. 

For example the following possibilities here are:

1. creationists are correct and evolutionists are incorrect
2. creationists are incorrect and evolutionists are correct
3. creationists are incorrect and evolutionists are incorrect
4. creationists are correct and evolutionists are correct

Additionally you can have partly correct cases and as well new parties could be lead into the debate which multiplies the possible outcomes every time.

So as you can see this whole debate is not really leading anywhere, since of course you can play party A against party B and one may win or be more correct than the other, but this will lead you nowhere, since the debate is about whether the theory of evolution is correct or not and even if the theory of evolution gets disproven this does not automatically prove creationists are right, that is not how it works.

To help you out I tell you how a debate works, first a hypothesis is formulated, then two parties are created and party A tries to verify the hypothesis using arguments and party B then tries to disprove the hypothesis also using arguments. When that is done the parties switch sides and party A tries to disprove the hypothesis and party B tries to prove it, that way you elimiate any bias and make sure that equal force is used to verify each side.

The end goal of such a debate is not for a party to win, but to find a solution for the problem and come closer to the objective truth about the matter.",1519901147,221,2018-03-01 05:45:47

The consensus was that a new previously unknown preservation method involving crosslinking was the cause of the discovered soft tissue. He however is rejecting this completely.

He is of the opinion that the entirety of the evidence is based upon unfounded assumptions. Including naturalism, materialism and uniformitarianism.  

We have been going back and forth for a little while but i will copy and paste his last reply to me below. Although i understand that without the context of the previous message it may be a little messy. 

**His latest reply**

""*She rejected the first because of her years of studying Paleontology. This field has foundational worldview assumptions. They are philosophical naturalism and materialism, and uniformitarianism.*

*Please list what you believe to be the best Observable and repeatable evidence from the mountains to which you refer, which is exclusive to your propositions..*

*Dr Schweitzer did not confirm her third hypothesis by observing and repeating a natural process by which the tissue could be preserved. She crafted an artificial and controlled experiment, wherein the conditions were not what any reasonable person would expect to find naturally occurring. It was nothing remotely like the conditions under which the remains were found. with that designed and controlled experiment, she was able to extend the potential preservation to a few years, not millions.*

*How are the rock layers dated? By what is found in them? By radiometric dating processes, which depend upon assumptions which cannot be known by observation or repetition, and have produced conflicting results? The presence of the soft tissue alone call the dates into questions.*

*The assumptions are that we know the original conditions of the samples. We cannot. It assumes thew uniformity of decay rates. It assumes that conditions did not change, affecting the samples. No one has directly observed anything that is assumed in dating. And there is enough data to question them, making them far from conclusive, and not observable or repeatable fact.*

*If there is a natural explanation, it must operate on natural laws and principles. it must be demonstratable, now. Dr Schweitzer did not find the conditions necessary for such a process present or evidence in the original setting for the samples. She did not establish such a process by carefully crafted experimentation.*

*I do operate on a set of assumptions, arising from a world view. So do you. We all have the same data. We just interpret it differently, based on worldview. The questions becomes one of philosophy, and which worldview can best explain all that needs explained. Philosophical naturalism and materialism are wholly insufficient for the task.*

*I pointed to Dr Lewontin's quote, because he is open about what drives the faith in the model first made popular by Darwin. As one who believes in naturalistic and materialistic explanations, he admits there really is no observable and repeatable data to support it. No processes that can be observed in the here and now. Just an a priori commitment to a philosophy that rejects out of hand the possibility of God.*""",1519755821,12,2018-02-27 13:23:41

39,No-Karma-II's insane card bet.,11,True,"So u/No-Karma-II is posting on crypto currency subreddits trying to create a challenge to to show evolution is too unlikely to have happened, and the prize is $10,000.

&amp;nbsp;

[The post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7zc4y8/please_help_me_design_a_challenge_that_pays_10000/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I want to demonstrate the immensity of the number of permutations of a common deck of cards, in order to prove a point in the creation/evolution controversy. To this end, I'm prepared to place in escrow $10,000, payable to the first person to guess the permutation that I hold in secret.

&gt; The general method that I think would work as the basis of this challenge, would be to create the secret one-time randomly-generated card permutation, and then create and publish a cryptographic hash of it, as represented in a fixed format. In this way, the challenger could generate ""guesses"", calculate the hash, and compare that hash to my published hash. Only when the two match would it be necessary to submit a proposed solution (and the solution would already be known to be correct).

&gt;  * I want it to be guaranteed that the payout will happen if someone produces the correct answer (viz., the funds are there and I cannot withhold payment).

&gt;  * I don't want it to be necessary that I or others trust anyone as a neutral judge.

&gt;  * If no one can produce the correct answer within a set time, say 5 years, I want the funds to revert back to me (actually, I guess this stipulation is superfluous, since I can simply produce the correct answer at any time).

&gt;  * This one is hard: I need to publicly prove that an actual correct permutation exists, before the secret permutation is revealed, without giving any clues to the solution. This is to prevent someone from charging that the published hash does not map to a valid card sequence.

&gt; I think that this may be possible to do, using things like zero-knowledge proofs and cryptocurrency.

&gt; Ideas?

That's right people, a shuffled decks of cards, the Evilutionist's^TM undoing. I feel this challenge shows just how little No-Karma-II understands biology.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't even know where to begin here. Does No-Karma-II not understand that DNA used 4 nucleobases and not 52? That nucleobase sequences repeat? What about guessing? In evolution you keep best outcomes and pass them on. If someone guess the first card correct do they get to guess again since they already know what the first card is? It wouldn't take long to spam guess cycling through the position of all 52 cards in the first spot until you got it right, then moving on to the second card.

&amp;nbsp;

But none of that would even matter because evolution doesn't have a goal, there is no ideal sequence that is trying to be reached.

40,Can genetic entropy be historically proven/disproven for the evolution of animals with larger genomes?,6,True,"The debates on Mendel’s Accountant and genetic entropy which I can find with the search functions on this sub mostly focus on the technical side of it, and I have read these discussions with great interest. I wonder, however, specifically whether or not the issue can be resolved through this empirical evidence.

The reason I specify larger genomes is that most of the experiments I have seen, and which are discussed here, are in micro-organisms and flies, where creationists typically respond that the genomes are too small for the data to be extrapolated, and that genetic entropy will doubtless remain a problem for more complex organisms such as ourselves.

Whether or not this rationalisation is correct (and I assume many of you will be of the view that it isn’t) I wondered whether similar observational evidence from experiments or recorded historical data (so excluding palaeontology) could be used to prove/disprove the idea of genetic entropy/Haldane’s Dilemma/Mendel’s Accountant for larger animals. Do these models make falsifiable predictions here?

To give an example of the kind of evidence I would find particularly persuasive, u/Dzugavili’s Grand List of Rule #7 arguments states that

&gt; Furthermore, we have genetic samples dating back several thousands of years, and the predictions made by Mendel's Accountant do not pan out: Mendel's Accountant suggests we should each have thousands of negative mutations not see in the genome even 1000 years ago, but historical evidence suggests genetic disease has relatively constant throughout history.

44,Quick Lesson: Error Catastrophe vs. Extinction Vortex,13,True,"[Here's an interesting OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7y0281/a_thought_experiment_about_genetic_entropy/) The question is this:

&gt;What would it look like if a species were to go extinct as a result of genetic entropy?

JohnBerea answers thusly:

&gt;I think it would be pretty difficult to distinguish it from other causes of extinction. As the diversity of beneficial alleles decreases and is lost from the population, it becomes more difficult for it to adapt to changing environmental pressures. Then the population whenever it faces disease, predation, or an unusually harsh winter. Then with smaller numbers, inbreeding increases, accelerating the process.

&gt;So did the species go extinct from a harsh environment, from inbreeding, or from genetic entropy? That's like asking whether a man was killed by a gun or a bullet.

This is actually a really good question, and John's answer conflates two different potential causes for extinction. So let's talk about how we can tell the cause of extinction if we are in a position to observe it.

&amp;nbsp;

First, some vocabulary:

**Error catastrophe** is the accumulation of harmful alleles, primarily due to mutation rates, which results in a decrease in the average reproductive output of a population to below the level of replacement, eventually leading to extinction.

An **extinction vortex** is when a population drops below a threshold (the **minimum viable population**, or MVP), resulting the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift, and an increase in harmful recessive traits due to inbreeding. Consequently, subsequent generations have even lower fitness, so each successive generation is smaller, leading to stronger drift, more inbreeding, and therefore lower fitness, eventually culminating with extinction. 

**Genetic entropy** is a term invented by creationists that biologists don't actually use. The real term is error catastrophe, as described above. 

&amp;nbsp;

So if we have a population that we're watching, and it is shrinking, clearly on its way to extinction, can we tell if it's going extinct due to error catastrophe vs. an extinction vortex?

Yes we can. 

The key is the survey the genetic diversity. 

Error catastrophe is driven by mutation rate and mutation accumulation. It's a decrease in fitness due to the accumulation of many new, deleterious alleles. So if this is the case, we'd expect to *high* diversity and very *low* levels of homozygosity. 

An extinction vortex, genetically, is the opposite. It's fitness decreases due to the *loss* of alleles and subsequent increase in the frequency of deleterious recessive traits. So in a population in an extinction vortex, we expect to see *low* diversity and very *high* levels of homozygosity. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what do we see? Well, in small populations that are or were threatened with extinction, whenever we've been able to check (we don't always have the resources survey), we see an extinction vortex, *not* error catastrophe. In other words, we see low diversity and high homozygosity. We also know this is the case because of how we can rescue threatened populations: We've actually been able to *save* species with injections of genetic diversity from related populations or species. If those threatened populations were experiencing error catastrophe, the added diversity would have made the problem worse, not better. The textbook case of an extinction vortex rescue like this was the greater Illinois prairie chicken in the 90s. 

&amp;nbsp;

So. Error catastrophe or extinction vortex? They are opposites, we *can* tell the difference, and it's never been error catastrophe. ",1518825661,2,2018-02-16 19:01:01

A go-to argument for the common descent of man and chimpansee is the fused human chromosome 2 which I duly point out.

- Ah, but how do you know it is fused?

Well, there are two fused telomeres in the middle and two centromeres about halfway each.

- So how do you know the human chromosome wasn't the original and it has split into two parts in the chimp?

... Because telomeres are end code and two pieces of end code stuck together points at a fusion, not a split.

- But maybe in that human chromosome, the centromere just looks like two fused telomeres.

No.

- Can you prove that chimp chromosomes can fuse?

I can prove chromosomes can and do fuse all the time, about 1 in 1000 humans have extra fused chromosomes in their DNA.

- But specifically chimp chromosomes, in a lab, repeatedly tested with the same result.

There is no reason to even think chimp chromosomes are somehow special in that they wouldn't fuse.

- So you can't prove that?

At this point I'm getting a little ticked off, and say the following:
It wouldn't matter even if I could show you the research paper, since it wasn't the chimp chromosome that fused but the chromosome of out common ancestor and you'll undoubtedly use that as an 'out'

Him: correct.

I have two questions. Firstly, what is the scientific view on this problem?

1. It doesn’t exist, creationists are making it up

2. It exists but a few trivial assumptions will explain it.

3. It’s a real problem and we don’t know the answer, but the plethora of dating methods which prove these samples to be old means there must be some explanation.

Because I can’t make out from the responses in the relevant thread. I see mainly vague statements like “every measurement has some degree of uncertainty” and nitpicking about an analogy.

48,mtEve Was Not 6000 Years Ago,13,True,"This may be the single most common *specific* creationist talking point that I hear and read. mtEve, the most recent common ancestor of all human mitochondrial DNA, existed 6000 years ago. This number was arrived upon by calculating a mutation rate for the mitochondrial genome, surveying human mtDNA diversity, and doing the arithmetic to determine how long it would take for that diversity to accumulate if we started from a single genome. You’ll sometimes hear creationists discussing this work call the mutation rate used the “calculated” mtDNA mutation rate, as opposed to the supposedly less-reliable “inferred” rate.

&amp;nbsp;

This type of analysis – survey diversity, determine rate of change, calculate back to the common ancestor – is called coalescence analysis. The way this works is pretty simple. Say you have two cells, and there are ten differences in their DNA. At some point, they shared a common ancestor, and since that time, each lineage leading to your two cells has experienced five mutations. If we can calculate how long it takes for a mutation to happen in these cells e.g. one mutation per generation, we can calculate how long since the most recent common ancestor. Using a rate of one mutation/generation, that would be five generations. We then just multiply five generations by the time for a single generation to calculate the time to most recent common ancestor, or TMRCA. 

Pretty simple, right?

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s look at a second example, this time in two multicellular animals. This is harder, because they’re each going to experience many more mutations per generation than will get passed on. So let’s say we again have ten differences, but this time, we see that while each individual experiences five mutations per generation. Woah! They’re siblings, right? Five plus five if you go back a single generation gets you to their MRCA (their parent, in this case). But here’s the thing: No every animal cell is involved in reproduction. Only *germ line cells* are involved in making gametes – sperm and egg – so only mutations in the germ line can be passed on. All the rest of the cells, *somatic cells*, are not involved in reproduction, so any mutation there don’t get passed on.

So for coalescence analysis in multicellular things, we need to distinguish between the *mutation rate*, that rate at which changes occur, and the *substitution rate*, the rate at which changes *accumulate* from generation to generation. 

Going back to our hypothetical animals, we have a mutation rate of five mutations/generation, but (let’s say) a substitution rate of just one substitution (fixed mutation) per generation. Which means our two animals share a common ancestor not one generation in the past, but five, just like the cells in our first case. 

Still pretty simple, right? You just have to use the substitution rate rather than the mutation rate. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s get back to the mtMRCA. 

The creation-friendly age of about 6kya (thousand years ago) for the mtMRCA was calculated by Dr. Nathanial Jeanson. He used data from a pedigree study (i.e. comparing parents and children) to calculate a mutation rate the human mtDNA, and then used that mutation rate to determine how long it would take to accumulate the differences we see in the two most different peoples’ mtDNA. 

The problem is this: Jeanson counted *all* of the differences found between parents and offspring in this study. If the parents and children were different, that counted as a mutation that contributed to the per-generation mutation rate Jeanson calculated. 

&amp;nbsp;

Let me use [this illustration]( https://i.imgur.com/gkbXf9j.png) to show the problem here, and let’s say each arrow represents a single mutation. 

Looking at the whole figure, you can see a substitution rate of one substitution per generation. We can also see an overall mutation rate of four mutations per generation (three somatic, one germline). 

Now just looking at the grandparent-to-parent generation, we can see a single arrow representing that one substitution per generation, and three somatic mutations in each. So if we surveyed those two individuals, we’d find seven differences (three somatic mutations in each, plus the germline mutation in the parent generation. 

By Jeanson’s math, that’s seven mutations per generation, so if we find 140 differences between two individuals, or 70 per lineage since they diverged, that’s ten generations. 

&amp;nbsp;

That’s how Jeanson arrived at the rate he did, and the error should be clear. It’s not *seven mutations* per generation in our example here, but *one substitution*, since only a single new mutation is inherited from generation to generation. In other words, only one new mutation accumulates per generation. Using the same numbers as above, our two individuals with 140 differences are separated not by ten generations, but by *70*, an enormous difference. In human terms, this is the difference between a MRCA 200 years ago, and *1,400* (using a 20-year generation time).

&amp;nbsp;

So how do we deal with this problem? How can we tell what differences count as substitutions, and which are merely somatic mutations? 

The way to do it is to *not use data from a pedigree study*. Instead, we have to track differences across much longer timeframes, since over thousands of generations, the substitutions will vastly outnumber somatic mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Take for example my simple figure from above. Three somatic mutations and one new substitution per generation. Across, say, three generations, it’s 50/50 substitutions vs. mutations that explain the differences you see. But across three *hundred* generations, that’d be three hundred substitutions to just three somatic mutations, meaning the somatic mutations would have only a negligible (and, usefully, predictable) impact on the calculated substitution rate.  

So instead of looking at parents and children, survey from divergent groups with known TMRCAs. For example, the initial settlement of Pacific islands, or the resettlement of Europe after the last ice age. Known dates. Determine what the maximum number of differences are, and use *that* number to determine the per generation substitution rate. This is how we arrive at the “inferred” rate I referenced above, the one that is supposedly less accurate than the “observed” or “measured” rate Jeanson calculated.

So you get the substitution rate, and then you survey the most divergent populations possible (e.g. African, Pacific Islander, and Native American), determine the maximum number of differences, and used your empirically determined substitution rate to calculate the TMRCA for all of these groups, which is the TMRCA for human mtDNA, or mtEve. 

Using these *correct* techniques, we get a substitution rate 30-something times slower than the mutation rate Jeanson calculated, corresponding to a TMRCA in the neighborhood of [200kya](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694979/), not 6kya. 

&amp;nbsp;

Did that seem…not all that complicated? Good. It isn’t. It really pretty straightforward.

**""**Mutations are rare and good ones are even more rare. One reason mutations are rare is because there are sophisticated error correction mechanisms in our cells. So according to evolution random mutations created correction mechanisms to suppress random mutations. And that paradox is only the beginning. Because error correction mechanisms, as with pretty much everything else in biology, require many, many mutations to be created. If one mutation is rare, a lot of mutations are astronomically rare. For instance, if a particular mutation has a one-in-a-million (one in 10^6) chance of occurring in a new individual, then a hundred such particular mutations have a one in **10^600 chance of occurring**.

Evolutionists simply assume that those traits could have only come about through evolution, and then proceed to speculate over the details about how it may have evolved. That's like an ancient alien theorist asserting that aliens seeded life on earth and then speculating over *how* the aliens planted life on earth. But at the end of the day both amount to being conjecture to support an unverifiable claim. 

Providing explanations when asked for evidence doesn't prove evolution. ",1518334462,60,2018-02-11 02:34:22
57,"Since it is said to be unreasonable to demand that a pathway through protein space be given, here is an analogy for evolutionists to provide:",0,True,"I'm pulling this out from the depths of a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7wm63q/theres_no_evidence_that_mutationselection/du2jh24/) on a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7wm63q/theres_no_evidence_that_mutationselection/):

Evolutionists seem to think it is unreasonable to demand that a detailed mutation-by-mutation path through protein space be provided, *even once*. I claim that a pathway like this has never been described, for protein space or any similarly-populated address space, and indeed such paths do not in general exist. Show me I'm wrong.

As I have pointed out before, evolutionists have turned to English text to illustrate their genetic concepts on several occasions. John Maynard Smith used his well-known WORD =&gt; WORE =&gt; GORE =&gt; GONE =&gt; GENE mutation pathway to demonstrate that a wholly different word can be derived by point mutations (but this doesn't work for sentences, or even long words). Richard Dawkins used his controversial ""METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL"" to demonstrate something, I don't know what. So I suggest that we use text to demonstrate that it is (im)possible to mutate through a text space analogous to protein space. So, here's my challenge:

Start out with a sentence of your own choosing. This analogizes the first living cell. Then, mutate that sentence into a 300-page book, utilizing statistically probable single-letter mutations (additions, deletions or alterations), or word/sentence/page/chapter duplications/reversals/deletions/translocations etc. Every mutation step must result in a new composition that utilizes proper spelling, punctuation and grammar, and must convey a cogent and interesting theme (to analogize competition for survival).

If you don't like my analogy, explain why it is not applicable, and suggest an analogy you find more appropriate.

58,"Creationists, can you define ""information""?",8,True,"This is a specific response to users /u/no-karma-ii, and /u/semitope, and any other creationists who have used the argument ""mutations can't increase genetic information"", or some variant.

What I am looking for, and what you should also be looking for if you wish to have scientific integrity, is a concise definition of information. This definition should address all of the following points:

* Is information objectively quantifiable, and if so how? By objective I mean at no point should a subjective decision be required. Creationists have often said information is quantity dependent on the ""purpose"" or ""intent"" of the genetic information. I believe this is a subjective claim. If you involve metrics in your definition that I believe are subjective, I will ask you to objectively define them.

* If information is not objectively quantifiable, can you still justify placing such an importance on it in creationist arguments?

* Is new information and increased information the same thing? Creationists often use the two interchangeably, despite ""new"" and ""Increase"" having very different definitions.

* Is information, or our detection of information, scalable? Richard Dawkins was asked for a mutation that increased information. This implies that information increases are detectable on the most minute level possible in genetics.

* Are there any additional considerations that need to be made when assessing information, and its relation to the argument that it cannot increase? For example, some creationists say that information can increase in small quantities, but not at the quantities evolution requires. In which case, do any of these additional considerations also have objective criteria?

Note, that I am NOT looking for examples of what is or is not information. You may use them to illustrate your points, if you wish. But it will not count as a proper definition of information unless the above five dot points are addressed. Creationists usually have an idea of things that do and don't count as information, but I don't believe these have objective criteria. Rather, they are arbitrarily defined that way according to the creationist presupposition: Anything we've observed form naturally is not information, any extant life is information.

I don't actually believe anyone will be able to provide a definition. I don't believe there is any objective, mathematical metric that would directly correlate with both the complexity, and the quality of life on Earth. If you agree, and your answer to the first dot point is a direct ""no"", then you can feel free to only address the first two dot points, and disregard the rest.",1518316208,115,2018-02-10 21:30:08
59,There's no evidence that mutation/selection pathways exist for even ONE novel phenotypical characteristic!,0,True,"Evolution theory claims that ALL organisms that exist or ever existed are interconnected by mutation/selection events that are simple enough to occur by blind, undirected chance, and that EVERY intermediate step is a viable organism that is successful in the struggle for survival.

This claim is unsupported by evidence, but rather is a necessary conclusion derived from the BDMNP.

Even when biologists apply Intelligent Design, they are unable to create a series of mutation/selection events, theoretical or actual, that demonstrate that such a feat is possible.

If they could devise such a thing, even once, they would be able to answer such simple questions as, ""How many mutations are required to transition from the most recent ape-man ancestor to modern man (and what are the specific steps)?""

60,"Can I get a rebuttal to a rebbuttal of a rebuttal (Creationwiki, again)",3,True,"So I have been writing up some responses to creationwiki's critiques of talk.origins. I have come across this response I was wondering if I could your guy's responses to this. Recently my understanding of the defintion of transtional fossil has been clouded by misinformation spread by creationists. This creationwiki [response] (http://creationwiki.org/Transitional_fossils_are_lacking_(Talk.Origins) has to do with the defintion of transtional and due to my clouded understanding I wish to hear what you all have to say regarding this response.


The specific part I would like a repsonse to is this:


This is what talk.origins was responding to: There are no transitional fossils. Evolution predicts a continuum between each fossil organism and its ancestors. Instead, we see systematic gaps in the fossil record.


Talk.origns says this: ""There are many transitional fossils. The only way that the claim of their absence may be remotely justified, aside from ignoring the evidence completely, is to redefine ""transitional"" as referring to a fossil that is a direct ancestor of one organism and a direct descendant of another. However, direct lineages are not required; they could not be verified even if found. What a transitional fossil is, in keeping with what the theory of evolution predicts, is a fossil that shows a mosaic of features from an older and more recent organism.""


Creationwiki responds to talk.origins by saying: ""The problem here is the use of the word ""transitional"", the adjectival form of ""transition"" transition: Passage from one form, state, style, or place to another. Transitional fossil definition on the free online dictionary The use of the word ""transitional"" implies an ancestor / descendant relationship. If evolutionists do not mean it that way, then it is they that are redefining ""transitional"". Certainly when the average person hears the term ""transitional form"" they think ancestor / descendant, not simply a mosaic of different types. It also implies individual body parts in transition from one to the other. It seems that evolutionists are playing word games that make evolution theory seem stronger than it really is. When the non-scientific layman hears that fossil B is ""transitional between"" A and C, he thinks it means A-B-C, but evolutionists may mean: this: Evotree1.gif this: Evotree2.gif this: Evotree3.gif this: Evotree4.gif (You have to click on the [response] (http://creationwiki.org/Transitional_fossils_are_lacking_(Talk.Origins) to see these diagrams
or any number of other possible combinations. Usually when a Creationist says there are no transitional fossils they are talking to layman in layman terms, not evolutionist technical terms. While a field of study is free to define its internal terms as its practitioners see fit, when they use a common term in different way, they are obligated to distinguish between the technical and common uses of the term, but in this case it is seldom done. The use of the word ""transitional"" is also loaded with evolutionary presupposition. A more appropriate term would be a ""mosaic fossil"". If one assumes the common ancestor postulated evolution, then these mosaic fossils would show how different types are related even if they are out of sequence and/or not mosaic in other ways. However, when looked at from a more skeptical viewpoint, they often do not show any clear evidence of an actual transition. Sometimes the data is complete enough to make a good case that the animals are indeed related, but at other times it is not. However, evolution requires that one type of living thing evolved into another type, via intermediates that would be transitional (in the normal meaning of the word) between the two types, and we should expect to find evidence of these amongst the fossil record. By claiming that there are ""transitional"" forms, but that these are not ""transitional"" in the normal understanding of the word, Talk.Origins has tacitly admitted that there are no such fossils, just as creationists claim!""

69,A comment on the burden of proof and intelligent design,8,True,"Here's something that bugs me about how a lot of the discussion here is framed: People often suggest that defenders of evolution have a burden of proof to show that the genetic diversity that we observe in nature came only from mutation/selection.

Yet that's not really what we claim. When evidence for another mechanism, such as viral insertion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus), becomes sufficient its accepted into the evolutionary synthesis. As of right now mutation, selection, gene flow (movement between populations/plasmid exchange by bacteria), genetic drift (random loss of alleles) and viral insertion are all accepted mechanisms. I may have missed some obscure ones, and new ones occasionally are discovered.

Intelligent design proponents are making a specific, testable claim for the insertion of another (sixth) mechanism into that list. We know what intelligent design looks like, because we've done it ourselves. If you show me an instance of an organism gaining a sequence of DNA over one generation that isn't a copy of its existing genes, and doesn't look like a virus that infects said organism, I'll take that as strong evidence of a designer. That's not what we see in nature. Genes look like modified copies of each other, or of non-coding sequences or of viral sequences. That is what we see when humans genetically modify something by inserting DNA from a different organism.

You can't prove a negative. Maybe every species out there evolved except one species of sparrow, to whose genome the creator decided to add ""Xenu was here"" about three years ago. the burden of proof here is on the proponent of intelligent design, to find that hypothetical sparrow. In general in science, burden of proof is on the one proposing a new mechanism",1517943298,5,2018-02-06 13:54:58

If that elephant is only a yard away from 0, then, according to that measuring stick, that elephant is 0 miles away.

Unfortunately, it turns out to be a complete whine fest, where /u/Br56u7 shows how little self-awareness he has, and lacks all understanding of what he's talking about. These, along with his abusiveness, are why this subreddit turned on him within one week of him getting his powers.

&gt; Imposing your truth as the objective truth and seeing it as so true, that anyone who disagrees must be a liar or dishonest. Not seeing how someone can disagree with you is just a bad habit and this is all rooted in an incredible argument from incredulity.""I can't possibly see how someone disagrees!""

He lists no examples for any of his complaints, so there's no way to check whether his point has any merit. But he was called a liar because he would make a statement, then change either what he said, someone else said, or double down on the original statement knowing that it was already wrong. We know why he disagreed with us, and that's because he honestly thinks his creationist beliefs are true. He acts like anything which opposes those beliefs are from people who refuse to acknowledge the truth. It's almost a sickness how far he goes to deny that he's ever wrong.

&gt; Accusations of quote mining by suggesting that we're implying something we never suggested. In the confines of creationism/evolution, this goes along the lines of creationist going ""see, here look at this quote from this evolutionist/uniformitarian. He agrees and sees the same facts that we do yet concludes something different."" Then evolutionist,""QUOTE MINE! That person isn't a creationist at all and doesn't agree with you on this at all!"" Then creationist,""We never said he agreed with creationism, just that he saw the same facts as we do. We never implied what you think we implied."" This is almost always how this goes and evolutionist often ignore this (clear) fallacy and accuse YEC's of quote mining non stop which is dishonest. You end up rupturing and trying to block any trust that could exist between creationist and the general public, and this is a dishonest way of doing that.

The accusations I saw against /u/Br56u7 were because he kept quoting only part of a definition or part of a post elsewhere, and insisted that his partial quote was all that there was. He refused to accept that the parts he left out change his argument and invalidate it.

He's gone so far as to change what the complaints about quote mining are against him, which itself is a straw man fallacy.

&gt; Equivocating being wrong with lying. The definition of lying is telling a falsehood you know or believe to be wrong to someone. Evolutionist do this all the time at debateevolution and this is dishonest. This is because your now putting it in peoples minds that we're somehow evil and attaching morality to something can obscure objective reasoning. When your taught ""this position is wrong"", That's one thing but then going around and saying ""this position is wrong and evil and so are the people advocating for it"" then no matter how good the logic that position may have, people will avoid it because they think its evil.

Here, the problem with /u/Br56u7's claim is that when people did explain how he was wrong, he continued being wrong. That's how you get accused of lying. When you know something is wrong, people show you how that something is wrong, but continue saying it anyways.

&gt; The adhoms and ridicule. This really doesn't need much explanation, but this is dishonest because it enforces a ""peer pressure"" mindset when it comes to such things. I've seen many Christians in Scandinavia or europe be worried about telling people their beliefs or even believing in christianity because everyone else doesn't and is mocked if they do. This same logic is applied to creationism and this really obscures objective reasoning.

The ad hominems weren't ad hominems. Simply calling someone a mean name isn't an ad hominem at all. This is something too many creationists assume, and they will use this deflection to ignore the rest of a point someone's made. Here, /u/Br56u7 is using it again to ignore what happened to him.

The ridicule was justified. He made it clear that his intention was to ban people he wanted to ban. One of the first things he did was expand the definition of Rule 1 so almost anything could be considered violating this rule, and then inserted a 3-strikes policy to it. No other rule had this change to it. And it was only Rule 1 that he kept hammering on thread after thread.

When he began inserting himself into posts and warned people of Rule 1, he got backlash immediately. He was misinterpreting tone and direction of posts, and he never apologized for his overbearing moderation. He then went fully obnoxious, and started to remove posts because he inferred tone and arguments that weren't there. It was so bad that he would even lie about what someone said, and his lie would be exposed because another moderator would overrule his removal of the post and the original would be visible again.

He wasn't mocked for his beliefs; he was ridiculed because he was a slimy, dishonest creationist trying to punish non-creationists by abusing his powers.

&gt; Not wanting to debate equals HAHA YOU LOST! No, if you constantly were getting pulled in to debates were the opponent threw adhoms and commited all the above fallacies, you would probably never would want to debate them again and you'd probably ignore them. Yet, I see users doing this all the time which Is why I have to mention this here. This is equivalent to someone throwing pigeon shit at you while playing checkers and then crying victory when you don't want to play checkers with them.

The analogy is playing checkers with a pigeon, who shits on the board, knocks over pieces, and flies away claiming victory. That's exactly what /u/Br56u7 is doing here. He got caught lying about what happened to him here, and instead of apologizing for lying, he continued ramping up his victimhood. He claimed that he was banned from here, but all that happened was that he lost his moderation powers. He then claimed that it was a coup d'etat, but he was never in power more than one of several moderators who were added. No one else took his place, so there was no transfer of power.

His post-demotion whinefest just illustrated how little respect he has for the truth. And in any debate, when you resort to lying, then you did lose.

&gt; gish galloping by derailing the argument from its original topic to discuss an entirely unrelated topic that they know takes a ton of time and effort and will result in long and complex debates that a creationist isn't necessarily trying to get into. The creationist is simply trying to stay on topic and the evolutionist is trying to distract. This results in the evolutionist accusing the creationist/ID of avoiding it because he ""knows"" that he doesn't have an argument. Ex.""UCM is not a fact because x.""""UCM is a fact because Y, but creationism is fiction and not fact and has no evidence for it"""" Y is wrong because of Z""""You know creationism has no evidence so you don't answer."" Don't get me wrong, if the topic warrants it, Ill gladly give evidence and talk about 6k mtEve, water gaps, escarpments, cratonic sequences, submarine canyons, bioturbation etc. But if we're talking about a relatively simple topic like IC, I'm not going off a tangent and discussing an unrelated topic. In specifically sticking to IC.

I have no idea what he's bringing up here. The thread that included his claims about UCM not being a fact didn't have anything to do with creationism was wrong.

Here's the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/dtfmzi7/

No one brought up creationism there. What did happen was that /u/Br56u7 kept trying to tell scientists that he knew what a scientific fact was, and that they did not. He was arguing that known scientific facts simply weren't because of his interpretation of what a fact was. This was further evidence that he would be a terrible moderator, if he would argue that he understood science better than the scientists here.

He finishes with two quotes from the Bible, which further illustrate how little self-awareness that he has.

&gt; ""If a wise person has an argument with a fool, there will be ranting and ridicule but no satisfaction."" Proverbs 29:9

&gt; ""Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words."" Proverbs 23:9

Here is /u/stcordova's comment on the ""747 Junkyard"" argument being now in [the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/):

&gt; Actually most observed natural selection in the lab and field is destructive not constructive. To extend that awful dice analogy the right way, selection would prevent getting 10 sixes in a row EVEN LESS than random chance. We call that the problem of fitness peaks and reductive evolution, but such correct arguments are outlawed and now at r/debateevolution. In the world of r/debateevolution you must believe and recite what is false to be accepted just like saying the emperor has clothes when he has none.


When asked to source this, this was /u/stcordova's response:

&gt; Jerry Coyne (an evolutionary biologist) **acknowledge Behe's article on lab observations was by and large correct**. Coyne goes on to say Behe was wrong about evolution however because natural selection happens differently in Coyne's imagination (not actual experiments or field observations, lol).

&gt; See:
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/behes-new-paper/

&gt; Also google ""reductive evolution"".

&gt; And this describes how selection may cause such specialization that a little environmental perturbation results in extinction, **hence selection is an agent of destruction, not construction**:

&gt; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bij.12843/abstract

&amp;nbsp;

Also, we got our ex-YEC /u/Br56u7 posting this:

&gt; **We've [observed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/) genetic entropy among influenza viruses.**


&amp;nbsp;

An old friend /u/nomenmeum also says this about the ""747 Junkyard"" argument:

&gt; Of course, under those conditions.  This analogy exactly copies all of the fatal errors of Dawkins's ""Methinks it is like a weasel"" analogy: **It makes the outcome not only probable but inevitable, makes selection targeted for a specific outcome, and requires generation after generation of dysfunctional organisms to survive and replicate.**  [I made a post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7nfwif/new_years_cage_match_sanford_vs_dawkins/) not long ago if anyone is interested.

83,A Week Of Creationist Modding: Post-Mortem,20,True,"/u/Br56u7 has been removed as moderator.

Well, that was interesting, wasn't it?

His behaviour was strongly anatagonistic: the ""observed fact"" discussion comes to mind as one that is particularly grating. At this point, I feel the community won't accept him as a creationist moderator, mostly due to his rejection of some key aspects to science. Every attempt I made to soften his stances was met with rejection: we have some very, very long discussions on modmail in which logic seems to go out the window, but I may make a post about it, as I found a few points on genetic entropy that I figure might be worth discussing.

But I digress: what the goal of the creationist moderator experiment, and why do I think it is now unattainable?

# What was the experiment?

The experiment was intended to test whether a creationist moderator, particularly a hard creationist moderator, was capable of influencing discussion in a positive fashion.

The experiment was initially prompted by /u/Br56u7 in a challenge in /r/creation. Despite being rather sure myself that he would make a terrible candidate, I opted to place the architect into a central position, as I figured he would have the best motivation to perform well in the experiment. I took on one of the other applicants, and an evolutionist moderator to act as his foils. Essentially, I would moderator the moderators.

At that point, I was rather hands-off and generally supportive. I allowed all forces in the experiment to operate more or less free of influence, though I had to take the reins at a few moments in order to prevent the experiment from spinning out.

The goal of the experiment was to determine the effects of a creationist moderator and whether they can act objectively when they treat science irrationally -- and more importantly, can they operate within the standard ruleset of a real society, rather than a location where they have to be coddled.

# Termination Condition

Unfortunately, community pressure reached a peak. I expected that within a few days, he would soften a bit and understand that he can't be at war with the community. However, it seems he is repeating the same discussions on a daily basis and this obsession is troubling.

Given particular statements from the community, I think it's best that we end the experiment now.

# Observations

##Hostage taking

At more than one occasion, /u/Br56u7 and /u/RibosomalTransferRNA threatened to resign. In each case, I would apply a moderating influence and then more or less do nothing.

In particularly, I note the following message from /u/Br56u7, regarding the inclusion of genetic entropy and the Junkyard 747 on my Rule #7:

&gt;As I've feared, this expansion of rule 7 has been taken advantage of to censor actual debates and arguments. This is why, if I don't see that argument removed from that thread in 24 hours I'm leaving the subreddit. I've been fine dealing with all the other crap, but this is the limit. If you don't delete, I'm simply going and Ill satisfy the fantasies of every user on this subreddit. I'm not going to stand here and see these 2 perfectly legitimate arguments get banned because people don't like them, and if I'm gone don't bother to tag me on this subreddit again.

That was two days ago, during which time I only further expanded my entries on genetic entropy. So, it was rather clear his threat was empty. I don't know whether my arguments were getting through to him.

We have been discussing the failings of Sanford's Genetic Entropy model for the past two days through modmail, as I explain why I'm including it, but I suppose that discussion is likely over. He's welcome to make a thread on the subject, with the understanding that all I'm going to do is shit on Sanford's model, his failed prediction and the lack of any physical evidence.

Once again, I digress: 

## Unusually high aggression

Boy, did you guys go after him quick. And boy, does he not know when to back off.

Pretty much from the get-go, he attempted to implement strong safe-space policies. He never took my suggestion to try soft methods, pretty much always just flashed the posts and kept arguing. This made him a strong target, as he overmoderated.

Part of moderating a debate forum is to not shut down discussion -- this means I usually only moderate the posts strongly and leave the comments to sort themselves out. This usually operates fine. Unfortunately, he took to the position of arguing every position, when power is best leveled in vague and otherwise indifferent threats.

Rather than trying to police aggression only made to our guests, which is the more proper method, he took every slight against any creationist, even shadowpuppets, trolls and vague 'theys', as being a hostile. He had a really low bar. This only led to a further piling on.

# Conclusion and Predictions

/r/creation will shortly lose their shit and ignore that antagonism had reached a critical level where I'd remove any moderator, atheist, creationist or otherwise if the community reacted this strongly.

/u/Br56u7 will probably play the martyr. He'll probably double-down on the subject we were discussing.

85,How Creationists don't understand geomorphology.,11,True,"An individual of interest in this sub lately has posted to /r/Creation an article entitled ""[Geomorphology provides multiple evidences for the global flood](http://creation.mobi/geomorphology-provides-evidence-for-global-flood)"".  This is, of course, from CMI, so we can be sure right off the bat that it will be either dishonest, false, or both, given the track record of papers from that organization.  I figured I'd try my hand at showing how poorly both the author of the article, and the individual who posted it to those who share his belief in fiction ([defined by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) as ""the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination—**in other words, not based strictly on history or *fact*.**""), understand the topics at hand.  

* Mountains

The article claims that the origins of mountains is unknown, while at the same time linking to a book that shows how mountains came to be.  Well, suppose that this doesn't meet his skewed definition of ""fact"" for the moment, because the book didn't witness it or somesuch.  Howsabout we look at the Cascade mountains.  These mountains are at the edge of an oceanic and continental plate, with the oceanic plate subducting under the continental one, causing the mountain range to rise.  How do we know that this is actually happening?  Well, because we've observed it happening, and we've measured it - the oceanic plates are subducting there about 3-4 cm per year.  We have confirmed that there is material from the oceanic crust beneath the mountain range, as well as tholeiitic basalt ophiolites from the mid-oceanic ridge present in the tops of the mountains in that range.  However, for the most compelling evidence, I think, we need to go to the Carbet Mountains on the island of Martinique in the Carribean.  A [study done in 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/26/7082) showed that the lava from the volcanoes that formed these mountain masses, which was originally formed in the mantle, also contain a magnesium signature unique to oceanic crustal materials in the area, confirming that it came from oceanic crustal material joining with mantle material beneath the volcanoes, just above the subduction zone.

* Planation surfaces

The article claims they're difficult to explain...  What, the author couldn't go to the [wiki page on Mesas?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa#Formation)

* Inselbergs

The article claims they're difficult to explain...  What, the author couldn't go to the [wiki page on Inselbergs?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inselberg#Geology)

* Pediments

The article makes the claim that because we don't see them being formed today, then we have to throw uniformitarianism out the window.  That's like saying that because the bakery isn't making croissants today, we have to discard all of baking.  Sure, it's not known precisely what conditions cause the formation of pediments, but if we don't know what causes them, how can he say that they aren't being caused?

* Hard rounded rocks transported long distances 

Now we're discussing the shape and origins of some of the rocks found on the pediments from earlier, and we see the author assuming his Young Earth conclusions: 

&gt; ""Some of the rounded rocks were transported long distances, more than 1,000 km from their sources, which is impossible to explain by the relatively weak size and power of today’s streams and rivers—even by local floods.""

Just today's streams and rivers...  but we're just going to ignore billions of years of other streams and rivers because they don't fit your preferred narrative.

* Gorges and water gaps

Ah, the classic ""water would have had to flow uphill to cut the Grand Canyon"" nonsense.  This is where the author's willful dishonesty comes to the fore, because it isn't like this hasn't been debunked a zillion times before by people who actually make it their business to study this.  I'll let [potholer54 cover the explanation for this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wa_ey3jGPs&amp;t=3m32s).

* Submarine geomorphology

Again, the answer to how continental shelves were formed [is but a google search away](http://marinebio.org/oceans/continental-shelves/).  The same could be said of the formation of oceanic trenches, but there's several formational mechanisms depending on what trench and where, so I'll just spell it out in two words: *plate tectonics*.

Finale: Flood Baloney!

&gt; The majority of the erosion and deposition of the Earth’s surface took place during the runoff of the Flood water, when the mountains and continents rose and the ocean basins sank.

From the bibliography, it seems that he's using a model that involves the ""waters from the deep"" and assumes that everything afterwards will conveniently stratify into nice tidy layers, precisely as has never been seen from any flood ever.  Let's ignore the problems of post-flood and examine the problems of the flood itself, using water from such a source.

The main issue is that the ambient temperature of rock from even a mile underground is above the boiling point of water... well above.  Any ""water from the deep"" would be released in the form of steam.  When 1 gram of steam condenses to 1 gram of liquid water at 20 degrees Celsius, it releases 2454 joules of energy. 1 m^3 of water is 1,000,000 grams. The surface of the Earth is 510,072,000 km^2 or 510,072,000,000,000 m^2 (or, more scientifically written: 5.10*10^14 m^2 )

Thus, if we drop a measly meter of water a day at an average temperature of 20 C (68 F), the amount of energy released is:

2454 joules/g * 1,000,000 g/m^3 * 5.10*10^14 m^3 per day = 1.25 * 10^24 joules per day. That is 2.991 * 10^8 megatonnes/day; more than 14 billion nuclear bombs as powerful as those dropped on Nagasaki. Now consider we're doing this every day, for forty days. The Pentagon would envy such an arsenal.

Put another way, for every m of water level increase, we have to release 2.454 billion joules/m^2 . At a rate of 1 m/day, this comes to 2.454 billion joules/day/m^2 or a radiance of 28.4 kilowatts/m^2 - roughly 21 times the brightness of the sun! Result: The atmosphere rapidly turns into incandescent plasma incinerating Noah, Ark, animals, and all. Nothing survives, the oceans boil and the land is baked into pottery... and this wouldn't even be enough water to cover the highest mountains, as described in the Bible.

The rest of the proposed explanation as to how a global flood would explain all these things for which we already have an explanation is a bunch of handwaving and unsupported assertions, and ultimately meaningless given that any water from the source used in their model wouldn't be liquid water, but rather, a blast wave of steam, quickly circling and sterilizing the planet.

What preconceived expectations do most people in here have when they know they are going to dispute evolution with a YEC? That we might heavily disagree on genetics, paleontology, physics, chemistry?

 What the heck are those words and why does everybody here disagree with me??

---

Anyway, to get to the point as to **why this thread is important**:

Our new YEC mod apparently wants way more than to just make everything more civil (which I'm also agreeing to) but he also wants to have a say in other things. Most notable, **what does and doesn't belong into the ""Bad Arguments"" category in the sidebar**.

If we want him to do that, we need to clarify things. Actually, I would say it's more like we have to *teach* him these definitions. I hope he is willing to endure a whole thread dedicated to him, that is why I will enforce civility and objectivity way more than I would in any other thread. Keep it calm, focus on the argument. 

Let's go.

&amp;nbsp;

**SCIENTIFIC FACT**

&gt; A fact is a statement that is true or can be proven with evidence. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means).

&gt; In science, a fact is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called empirical evidence.

&gt; In the most basic sense, a scientific fact is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a hypothesis or theory, which is intended to explain or interpret facts.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact#In_science)

/u/Br56u7 seems to disagree that certain established scientific facts are indeed, facts:

&gt;&gt; ""In science, a fact is a repeatable careful observation or measurement""

&gt; Universal common ancestry is neither of these, because we did not observe all life evolving from a common ancestor. Don't equivocate being supported by the observable with being observable and I'm not making this definition up. Just look on the Wikepiedia link I've provided, and youll find the exact words.

&gt; If it isn't a verified observation, it isn't a fact. Is there a 99.9% chance that Pluto will orbit the sun and make a roundtrip? Yes. Is it a verified observation? No. So its not a fact.


**OBSERVABILITY**

Observable, people ask? After saying that, the discussion changes to the topic of what observable is. /u//u/Br56u7 says:

&gt; As I've said, a scientific fact has to be an observed phenomena. Most people try to equivocate having support from the observable with being observable, which merely isn't the case. If having proof from the observable makes a theory/hypothesis a scientific fact, then opposing theories could be labelled as facts simultaneously from the definition of a scientific fact, which I'll repeat
scientific fact is an objective and verifiable observation

&gt; I did mean observed in the broad sense of all 5 senses to. Most people when arguing about what is a scientific fact, pick the definitions to have qualms about rather than my use of it. We have observed Pluto with all 5 senses orbiting the sun, if we hadn't till now then it wouldn't be a scientific fact. **If your disagreement is over what a scientific fact is, then too bad.**

&amp;nbsp;

They have a new piece up on the complexity of early life, but start with a series of Darwin quotes, to show how *committed* he was to gradualism:

&gt;I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of ‘Natura non facit saltum.’ We meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so? (p. 194)

&gt;On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, ‘Natura non facit saltum.’ This canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my theory be strictly true. (p. 206)

&gt;The canon of ‘Natura non facit saltum’ applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs. (p. 210)

&gt;The canon in natural history, of ‘natura non facit saltum’ is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise inexplicable, — all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection. (p. 243)

&gt;As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of ‘Natura non facit saltum’ which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man can explain. (p. 471)

Where are all these from?

&gt;Here are representative quotes from Origin, **1st edition**, making clear how important this doctrine was to Darwin

Emphasis mine. Because Darwin *changed his mind* due to later findings. Here are his revised thoughts, from the 5th edition, 1869:

&gt;“The periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”

&amp;nbsp;

The rest of the piece is devoid of content. Things are complex! Evolution is complicated! Yup. Wait to you actually know what you're talking about. It's *bonkers*. 

Is there a conclusion? Therefore...something? No. Just a series of Darwin quote-mines (and yes, this is quote-mining, since it's misrepresenting Darwin's position) and some life-is-complex-therefore-something-evolution word salad.

# BAD CREATIONIST ARGUMENTS

## THERMODYNAMICS

Example: Thermodynamics says everything trends towards chaos, so complex life could never evolve. Thermodynamics says that entropy is always increasing.

Counter: Thermodynamics refers to [closed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system#Closed_system), and the Earth isn't a closed system. We receive energy from our star, which drives thermodynamics on Earth against the thermodynamic gradient, though there are other sources of energy closer to home, such as geothermal sources

Entropy isn't constantly increasing: local drops in entropy are fairly common, such as cooling water in your fridge. However, you had to get the power from somewhere else.

There is also the concept of the [vacuum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state) and [quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation), in which quantum events drive the system against entropy: to put simply, sometimes there is no way but up. These events require specific conditions and produce very unusual conditions, such as [superfluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity), that don't really make sense to us in a normal everyday world.

Why It's Bad: It's made by people who don't really understand thermodynamics.

## INFORMATION THEORY

Example: Information theory says intelligent information has to come from somewhere, so something intelligent must have generated the genome.

Counter: [Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) says nothing of the sort -- mostly because it's abstract mathematics, mostly dealing with things like encryption or file compression. The physics definitions of information, in which information is conserved, operates on [a far lower level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science) than genetic information, which is primarily chemical interactions. It can be used to describe conservation of energy and the results of that in quantum operations, but the applications of information theory isn't particularly meaningful to genetics outside of the statistical modelling.

Why It's Bad: Information has specific meanings in different fields of study. In the microchemical level that DNA is on, information is the physical properties of particles and chemicals, and that information is rearranged to become life -- there's no violation of information theory, since we didn't need any physical information that wasn't already here. Furthermore, information theory doesn't really mention intelligences, just how much information can be encoded and decoded from various sources -- it'll readily allow for random sources.

## 'EVOLUTION IS JUST A THEORY' or 'A THEORY ISN'T A LAW'

Example: Evolution is just a theory, it isn't proven. It's not a law.

Counter: [Scientific theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) is not a guess, it's a repeatable, evidence-based model for prediction, one that models reality with reasonable-to-strong accuracy and usually our best model; and [scientific law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law) defines relationships strictly, usually in mathematical terms. Gravity is, after all, just a theory -- but you don't see anyone shouting to teach the controversy.

Why It's Bad: If you don't even know what a theory is, you're not ready for this.

## Y-ADAM and MITOCHONDRIAL-EVE

Example: The existence of Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam show that all humans descend from a single pair of individuals.

Counter: These 'individuals' are determined from the statistical analysis of genetic drift in heritable, non-recombining genetic sections: the Y-chromosome, inherited down the paternal line; and the mitochondrial genome, inherited down the maternal line. [Mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_eve) and [Y-chromosomal Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam) didn't even exist at the same time -- they are currently separated by hundreds of thousands of years.

The individual who is thought to be the current Mitochondrial Eve or Y-chromosomal Adam, and the dates at which they lived, have to be moved backwards in time as new lineages are discovered and they also can move forwards as lineages die out. The more fundamental issue is that neither Y-chromosomal Adam, nor Mitochondrial Eve, were the only males, or females, alive at the time: other sections of the genome have different most recent ancestors, separated by huge amounts of time, but recombination makes analysis far less precise. Using the same sorts of genetic analyses that allowed us to discover Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam, since humans arose, there have never been fewer than 1,000 individuals, based on the number of distinct genes found in the genome today.

Why It's Bad: It completely misrepresents data to make it appear to agree with the Biblical narrative when it in fact outright refutes it in multiple ways. 

## Junkyard 747 Argument

Example: The odds of evolution having happened are the same as the odds that a tornado in a junkyard will assemble a Boeing 747.

Counter: Evolution is not an entirely random process, thanks to [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection). The best variants are retained, so evolution doesn't start from scratch every time.

An analogy that explains natural selection's role in evolution would be: Take 10 dice and roll them until you get all of them to show a specific number -- let's say 6. The odds of this happening are infinitesimally small: 1 in 60,466,176.

Now, roll all the dice, but every time one of them reaches 6, keep it aside. Repeat until all show 6. Any given roll is now 1 in 6 to fix a die. To fix the 10 dice will take on average 60 total thrown dice total -- you'll be done in minutes.

Why It's Bad: It ignores one of the central pillars of Darwinian evolution: selection and genetic inheritance.

# BAD EVOLUTION ARGUMENTS

Someone think of one, I'm tired enough from thinking of two for Creationism.

# JUST BAD ARGUMENTS

## YOU WEREN'T THERE

Example: How do you know everything evolved from a universal common ancestor? How do you know the flood didn't happen? How do you X, when you weren't there?

Counter: This is frequently an argument for an given event that occurs very rarely, or perhaps even once. Ultimately, we rely on the scientific principle of [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability). It isn't about seeing the event itself -- after all, every day before I was born I'll never observe, yet I generally accept that at least most of history really happened -- it is about understanding the effects that follow and surround it.

Certain events in evolutionary history were not described by humans in any meaningful way, just as certain events described in theological history were not described by humans in any meaningful way. An event is observable if despite not knowing all the specifics about it, you're still able to make meaningful inferences.

Why It's Bad: Ultimately, either of our sides relies on a certain amount of under-observed events, whether it's Noah and his flood, or early human evolution -- and then unobserved events, such as abiogenesis or the ordinary Genesis. At the end of the day, we can debate about which has more observability, but reducing the argument down to hard proofs, ones that if either side had compete would utterly end this debate entirely, is just not helpful.",1517205978,141,2018-01-29 01:06:18

96,Let's discuss Methodological Naturalism: Why does science depend on it?,9,True,"Hey all, I realize that philosophy isn't something this subreddit engages in often, but I've always felt that it is so crucial in discussions of creationism and evolution.  This is because while the bulk of the debate focuses on more high-level concepts (genetics, paleontology, cellular biology), core disagreements between scientists and creationists tend to occur on a much more fundamental level.  All the empirical evidence in the world simply won't matter when, in the end, the person you're engaging with doesn't believe in objective reality, for example.

I realize that this is a bit of a megapost, but I **implore** you to read this essay due to its central importance.

Scientists tend to poo-pooh philosophy, which frankly is a rather unfortunate trend.  The fact is, both fields are quite similar.  Much like science, philosophy is a system of critical thinking, and was in fact the field that gave birth to science in the first place by establishing the methods by which science operates.  The method that will be outlined here is something that comes up fairly often in this subreddit:  why science relies on natural explanations, and whether there is room for supernatural entities in science.

**What do we mean when we say “Natural?”**

One of the very first things we do in philosophy is to define, as precisely as possible, our terms.

When we refer to “nature” and “natural” entities in the context of science we aren't talking about something in contrast to artificial constructs.  Even what we call “artificial” things such as computers and nylon are simply natural organisms (humans) taking advantage of natural resources and natural laws to execute specific goals.

No, when scientists and philosophers discuss “nature,” we are referring to the observable world.  Natural entities can be touched, seen, measured, weighed, or otherwise compartmentalized to a specific set of properties.  Natural entities have discrete quantitative and qualitative features.  

Let's consider one natural entity as an example: the human brain.  The brain is a mass of nervous tissue encased in connective tissue components.  On average it weighs approximately 1300-1400 grams, about as much as a small bag of potatoes.  There are ~85 billion neurons in the human brain, and about as many support cells called glia.  We can also divide the brain up functionally: there are specific regions for tactile sensation, vision, linguistic processing, spatial reasoning, etc.  When one region is damaged or otherwise inhibited, you see a corresponding change in mental capacity or behavior.

I can wax on for ages about neuroanatomy, but this segues to another natural entity being investigated by science:  the human mind.  Human cognition can be similarly broken down akin to the software that reflects the biochemical and neural events occurring in the brain.  The human mind is a gestalt of specific processes that operate in parallel:  attention, self-awareness, semantic reasoning, memory storage, memory retrieval, etc.  Many of these functions are localized in specific regions of the brain (linguistic comprehension is localized in a region in the left brain hemisphere, between the temporal and parietal lobes), while others appear to be more spread out (such as memory).  Damage to specific regions will lead to specific deficits in the human mind.

So overall, these two very natural entities *are* natural by virtue of the fact that they have specific properties, both qualitative and quantitative, and can be subject to deep investigation.

**What do we mean when we say “Supernatural?”**

Now lexically, the term “supernatural” means “above” or “beyond” nature.  So “supernatural” refers to the flip side of the coin: entities that have *no* specific properties, or are otherwise impossible to describe.

Whereas the human brain and the human mind can be compartmentalized to increasingly specific descriptions, the human *soul* as is generally conceived eludes such definition and investigation.  The soul can't be measured, observed, or defined.  Any ideas about the soul tend to be generic, vague, or speculative at best: it exists in a wholly alien and incomprehensible realm.

And whereas the brain and the mind are subject to increasingly deeper analysis, such analysis of the soul (and supernatural entities in general) become more problematic the deeper you go.  Look at the following list of questions for example:

* If souls interact through the human body, could the human soul interact through something else?  Could a human soul enter an animal, or a sufficiently complex computer?  Or is it only other human bodies?

* Assuming the human soul is connected to the body somehow, what is the nature of that connection?

* If we can determine the nature of that connection, could that connection be simulated using scientific tools?

* If that soul-body connection can't be simulated, why not?  What are the barriers that keep us from doing this?

* If the soul-body connection *can* be simulated, shouldn't it be possible to do a “soul transplant” and essentially mimic reincarnation under controlled conditions?  Surely there's a market for sinners who believe in Hell who want to try to escape eternal damnation using technological means, for example.

Now, as we go down this list I'm sure many of you are instinctively recoiling on some level.  As these questions probe further and further, they appear to be increasingly absurd... maybe even offensive.  The very act of asking such questions about a supernatural entity, something that is supposed to be so mystical, simply feels *wrong.*

This is because the more we define a thing the more we limit it into a single, compartmentalized form.  While the whole *point* of scientific investigation, the core essence of what it means to be “supernatural” is to have a mystical, elusive quality where the rules of behavior are soft at best, and the potential for anything to happen can exist.  Essentially, *magic.*

You thus notice that Intelligent Design proponents don't really *about* the Intelligent Designer so much as they speak *around* him.  Despite the core importance of the Designer in their hypothesis, it is very much an uncomfortable subject as to what the Designer **is**, precisely.

Some of this is no doubt political: an attempt to deny any relation to the idea's Christian roots and to evade long-standing judicial precedents that bar teaching religion in schools.  Yet it has long been the trend in Western theology to place a supernatural God in a realm that cannot be accessed by rational inquiry.

We see this from Tertullian, who was probably the most vocal early theologian that held the ineffability of God (described well in a quote commonly attributed to him: “credo quia absurdum,” or “I believe that which is absurd (regarding God)”).  The inability to describe God also posed a problem to early Christian theologians, who wanted to attribute some meaning to God while not limiting Him in any way, and necessitated the development of apophatic and cataphatic theologies to resolve this issue.

At this point, three things should be quite clear:

1.  “Natural” entities are those that can be described in specific terms.  When investigating natural entities, the more specific, the better.

2.  “Supernatural” entities are those that cannot be described in specific terms.  When investigating supernatural entities, we avoid specificity.

3.  “Supernatural” entities cannot be scientifically investigated because they cannot be defined or compartmentalized.

Yet even if supernatural entities evade such analysis, can they be used as premises in explaining natural phenomena?  That is, can a “supernatural explanation” work?

**What is an “Explanation?”**

An explanation is a series of premises that form a conceptual bridge between ignorance and understanding.  Each premise is a link interlocked with others, in a chain of reasoning to a specific conclusion.  It is by this means that we can answer questions of fact.

Let's consider a very basic ELI5-type question, and the following explanation:  “How do rainbows occur?”

1.  When a ray of light hits a new medium at an angle (such as from a vacuum to water), the ray can “bend” at an angle.

2.  Visible light is composed of multiple wavelengths.  The wavelengths we see as “Red” are longer, while the wavelengths we see as “Blue” are shorter.

3.  When visible light enters from a vacuum into water, “Blue” wavelengths of light are bent more, and “red” wavelengths of light are bent less.  

4.  This difference in how much each wavelength is bent when entering a new medium causes the different colors of  light to “fan out” in a process we call dispersion.

5.  On rainy or misty days, water particles in the air turn the atmosphere into a medium in which dispersion can occur, much like light entering a glass of water or a prism.  [Hence, rainbows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRuLhY0NAMI)

I would say that this is a minimal explanation sufficient for a fourth grader.  But note the *structure* of this explanation:  each premise is either a basic empirical observation that we can make, or a deduction based on known behaviors of these entities.  These premises are also necessarily linked to the others.  Premises 1 and 2 link through 3, 3 leads to 4, and 4 leads to 5 in an unbroken chain of reasoning.

Moreover, we can improve on this explanation.  We can lead a student through making observations herself by giving her a prism, a protractor, and laser pointers of different colors.  We can bring up the concept of the index of refraction and discuss Snell's law.  We can prove the existence of wavelengths of light.  We can describe the biology of the eye and how we observe colors.  And as we get more specific and detailed with our explanation, our understanding of the phenomenon becomes ever more complete.

Yet it must start here, with a minimal chain of interlocking premises that lead towards a conclusion to get a bare-bones understanding of the phenomenon.

Now, what happens when we remove one of these premises?  Well, the chain of reasoning is broken, the bridge to understanding is incomplete.  With that gap we can no longer say this explanation works the way it should.  This is because *a premise within an explanation works by virtue of its details,* and as we've established, the more thorough the details, the better our understanding.

If the premise instead were “an indescribable entity, through unknowable mechanisms, does something that cannot be specified,” then we see the same problem.  Without specific properties, observations, or demonstrated mechanisms, this potential premise cannot be linked with the others.

And because “an indescribable entity, through unknowable mechanisms, does something that cannot be specified” is the textbook definition of “supernatural,” supernatural entities cannot operate within explanations.

The fact is, the term “natural explanation” is redundant.  **All** explanations in the end function by virtue of being reducible to elementary observations, details, and specified mechanisms.  That is, *natural phenomena*.  And in contrast, “supernatural explanation” is an oxymoron, like a married bachelor.  “Supernatural” and “explanation” are inherently contrary when you consider what these terms mean exactly.",1517161883,96,2018-01-28 12:51:23
97,How can we know they are actually transitonal.,3,True,"Berkeley.eu describes transitonal fossils as ""fossils or organisms that show the intermediate states between an ancestral form and that of its descendants.""

My question comes as this. How can we know if something is truly transitonal. We cannot be sure that a fossil species went on to evolve into new species. It could be an evolutionary dead end. The definition from Berkley says that a transitonal fossil must have descendants. So if a transitonal fossil is an evolutionary dead end, can we still classify it as a transitional fossil? And if we can't call an evolutionary dead end a transition, then how can we know if any fossil is transitional? We can't know if they died off or not! We wouldn't be able to know if any transitonal fossils even existed.",1517118607,15,2018-01-28 00:50:07

103,Relationship between one’s opinion of evolution and one’s theological beliefs.,8,True,"I think many people who recognize the truth of evolutionary theory deal with creationists the wrong way. 

The usual method is to critique the creationist’s misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, basically showing how their understanding of the science is wrong. While this can be effective, I don’t think it is the most effective way to deal with creationists. 

Instead, I think it is much more effective to have a theological discussion. I don’t believe that a creationist’s critique of evolutionary theory can be separated from their theological view. The theological view is understood to be fundamental, which requires them to deny claims made through evolutionary theory, regardless of the evidence. This means that if the theological view is adequately critiqued, then there will be no reason to hold the anti-evolution views. 

I think some creationists would disagree with how I am framing this, and think they have legitimate scientific reasons to reject evolutionary theory, but I don’t think this disagreement ever amounts to much. 

So I think instead of a purely scientific discussion, we should recognize that a theological understanding is extremely influential on the viewpoints of creationists. Focusing purely on the science is a secondary approach.

Definition of [vestigiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality):

&gt; Vestigiality is the retention during the process of evolution of genetically determined structures or attributes **that have lost some or all of their ancestral function in a given species**.

Emphasis on *ancestral* function. So what does the top comment say? In short, the top answer presents several vestigial traits that have been found to (possibly) have function. See how this is already irrelevant given the definition of vestigiality? The argument is irrelevant and therefore already invalidated, but for the sake of discussion we can still look at it.

&gt; For example, evolutionists point to a human tailbone as proof that humans must have had tails at some point. Truth is, the tailbone is important not only for balance, but also for providing an anchor point for the lower extremities.

Well the truth also is, that that tailbone was once much *much* longer and was actually, well, a tail. So it's an example for a reduced ancestral function unless there are still lizard people around (Obama?).

Also, to dive into detail:

This is just a friendly survey question, not any right or wrong answer for the sake of argument, just soliciting your opinion for a book I'm writing....

There is the noticeable nested hierarchy that appears both in molecular and morphological comparisons.  For example, I constructed this phylogentic diagram on the COX1 mitochondrial protein using MEGA 6.0 software.  It recaptures the morphological hierarchy of Linnaeus:

http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nj_differnces_circled2-111-1.png

Fwiw this is the protein in question:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase_subunit_I

Now are the similarities the result of common descent or common design.   It seems to me, if some creature (like a fish) can't evolve into another creature (like a bird), then the patterns of similarity and diversity that for the twin nested hierarchies is the result of common design through likely an act of miraculous special creation.  

Alternatively, one could invoke the Faint Young Sun Paradox and other problems with the fossil record to show there wasn't enough time for evolution.

But all that aside, the bottom line question: ""is there any argument against the probability of evolution (Universal Common Ancestry) that would make you think creation is a possibility?""

If ""yes"" describe it. If you say ""no"", I respect that, but I'm soliciting whether in fact that is your position -- that perhaps nothing short of God showing up in front of you, working miracles and telling you point blank ""evolution is wrong"". If that is your position, I respect that in as much as everyone has their threshold of what would make a believer out them.  So, no right or wrong answer as far as I'm concerned (for the sake of argument), except that if creationism is true then there is a God who decides right and wrong.

&gt; /u/tom-n-texas: The creationist is looking for the small, gradual transitions that link larger groups and prove ancestry by a smooth flow of fossils. These smooth transitions seem not to exist, even admittedly by many evolutionary paleontologists, even by Darwin himself. So it depends on the definition of transitional one uses. Thus the debate.


&gt;&gt;/u/Jattok: See, we're not supposed to downvote the creationists who come here, but this post is exactly why those creationists get downvoted.

&gt;&gt;Your response accuses non-creationists of coining a subjective term, and then you argue that we don't have what creationists expect if evolution is true. **The debate isn't what creationists expect of evolution, but whether evolution explains what we see.** And it does.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a main approach to science. We see a phenomenon, we try to describe it. We hypothesize a process that should explain the phenomenon, we test it. If the process is correctly understood, it should match up with the evidence. If the process is *robustly* understood, we can even start using it as a predictive and retrodictive tool. The scientific method works and we corroborated a process that sufficiently explains a phenomenon.

This perfectly applies to the Theory of Evolution. It stands on its own. It's not based on the invalidity of another hypothesis.


&amp;nbsp;

This is were the flaws of many creationist arguments lie. Their hypothesis is fundamentally based on the *failing* of the ToE. Therefore their best shots are in trying to argue that an aspect of the ToE is not explained enough, which is a *weak*  criticism and can frankly be dismissed if they don't present a *competing* explanation.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm now going to list some of those arguments to show that this is actually the case:


* **Arguments that a certain trait ""could not have evolved""**

1. Relies on the fact that scientists don't have an explanation for every single trait in existence, which should be obvious.

2. Basically a ""God of the gaps"" fallacy just waiting to be debunked. Examples are traits which scientists later were able to explain, which is an expected trend that will continue.

3. Argument does usually not follow with a competing explanation in the form of a demonstrable process. It's entirely reliant on the *failing* of the most prominent explanation and doesn't offer more.

* **Arguments that the process of evolution does not sufficiently explain X**

1. Again, relies on the fact that scientists don't have an explanation for every single evolutionary pathway in existence, which should be obvious.

2. Basically a ""God of the gaps"" fallacy just waiting to be debunked. Examples are evolutionary pathways which scientists later were able to explain, which is an expected trend that will continue.

3. Argument does usually not follow with a competing explanation in the form of a demonstrable process. It's entirely reliant on the *failing* of the most prominent explanation and doesn't offer more.

111,Crackpot webpages by Stephen T Blume,8,True,"This is a recent thread on r/creation:

[Evo-illusionist webpages by Stephen T. Blume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7sj9tx/evoillusionist_webpages_by_stephen_t_blume/)

In it /u/MRH2 praised this Stephen Blume for his sarcastic style, and how he ""cuts into the fooling assumptions of evolution"". So let's have a look at how good this Blume character is.

We start by following the [link to his site.](https://evoillusion.org/) Immediately, two things will become obvious. First, the site looks like it used the best web design principles 1998 had to offer. This is a guy who saw the Space Jam website, and thought ""I must have it"". The text is different fonts and sizes, the background awkwardly repeats with visible edges, a lot of the text colours are hard to read against the background, ads awkwardly cut up parts of the text. The second thing you will notice, is that this guy writes a lot. Every single page seems to be covered in walls of text, and there are a lot of pages. This is the most dangerous breed of creationist; the one with lots and lots of time on his hands, who spends almost all of it writing about creationism. Unfortunately he didn't spend much of that free time learning web design.

After reading through as much of his writing as I could while maintaining my faith in humanity (I didn't get very far), you notice a familiar theme: He doesn't know very much. Indeed, almost every argument he makes is an argument from ignorance. He doesn't know why some organisms haven't evolved much in hundreds of millions of years. He doesn't know about transitional fossils. But the bulk of his site is about how he doesn't know how things evolved. Particularly this quote, also used in the original r/creation post:

&gt; Dawkins thinks that there were 100,000 to 250,000 mutations that evolved eyes. Since eyes have about 30 parts, just how did the 100,000 to 250,000 mutations divvy up amongst the 30 parts? Did 10,000 make the retina? Did 3,450 make the iris?

What's that evolutionists? Sorry...""evo-illusionists"". You don't know the exact number of mutations that it took to evolve each section of the eye? Well obviously if evolution can't identify each and every mutation in our history then it must be wrong. /Sarcasm.

Blume even addresses the models for the evolution of the eye, but instead of explaining where they are wrong, he just asks more questions. He asks where the optic nerves came from, or how the mutations knew to build an eye. Obviously he missed the beginners courses on evolution. Every time you get from step 1 to 2, he asks how you get to step 1.5.

I suspect that almost all of Blume's writing time is spent blindly asking questions about his laymens understanding of biology. Every biological feature he's every heard of will result in him asking ""how did that evolve"". And then he repeats that throughout the whole site. Sometimes it's asked differently. Sometimes he goes into more detail about the feature in question. But the pattern is the same. Describe a feature, ask how it evolved, describe another feature, ask how it evolved.

In other parts of the sites we have a lengthy posts about various debate's he's had across the internet. Not only are these debates long, but he's filled them with commentary and (poor) analysis. He's especially sure to point out each and every time someone was mean to him. I'd be worried this guy has a list of names he intends to ""cross off"" one day. Unfortunately the site doesn't appear to be active any more. If it were, I would recommend this guy come here, so we can tear him a new one.",1516786143,24,2018-01-24 04:29:03
112,"More Experimental Refutation of this ""Genetic Entropy"" Hogwash, From a Different Angle: ""Adaptation Obscures the Load""",12,True,"[Here's the paper.](http://www.genetics.org/content/184/1/221)

A bit of introduction. Creation ""scientists"" like John Sanford claim that mutation accumulation will lead to ""genetic entropy,"" a decrease in fitness ultimately causing extinction, due to the accumulation of deleterious (i.e. harmful) mutations.

No study has ever shown this to be the case, though there have been many attempts (including by me! Half my thesis was about my attempts to induce error catastrophe in single-stranded DNA bacteriophages).

A pair of studies by Crotty et al. are often used to argue that this does actually happen, but neither of these experiments supports that claim. One shows that a mutagen causes mutations (duh), and that can inactivate viral genomes in a single generation via a burst of mutations. This is not ""genetic entropy"" because that process requires a loss of fitness *over generations*. Sure, enough mutagen will just kill a thing all at once, but that's not the same. The other study show a fitness loss over generations, but was unable to demonstrate that that the accumulation of deleterious mutations were the cause, and due to the other affects in cells of nucleoside analogues like the chosen mutagen, [it's unlikely that mutation alone was to blame.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16287208) 

&amp;nbsp;

[The study I want to talk about](http://www.genetics.org/content/184/1/221) experimentally examines why error catastrophe, which is very readily predicted based on some basic population genetics, is extremely challenging. The answer something I don't think we've discussed here in all of our topics on ""genetic entropy"": As you cause mutations, you end up causing a TON of beneficial mutations. So while you may be able to decrease fitness by some degree, you at some point reach an equilibrium between the rate of deleterious and adaptive mutations. 

Remember, every time a deleterious mutation happens, you've now removed one deleterious mutation from the pool of all possible mutations, and added *at least* one beneficial mutation (the reversal) to that pool. The beautiful thing about this dynamic is that *higher mutation rates can't overcome it*. The equilibrium point is independent of the mutation rate, because the *relative* rate of good and bad mutations will not change if they are happening faster. The dynamic equilibrium is simply more dynamic. 

&amp;nbsp;

[So in addition to all of the other reasons why genetic entropy is bunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/), we have another: Adaptive mutations put a floor beneath which fitness will not fall, and accumulating mutations faster cannot overcome this barrier. 

(And I didn't even mention epistasis, which further enhances the likelihood of adaptive mutations...) ",1516677655,21,2018-01-22 22:20:55

120,A few questions about ERV’s,1,True,"ERV’s are claimed to make it probable that certain species are related, since the seemingly related species (established by other evidence such as similar bone structure) have ERV’s at the same spots. 

Are there scientific answers to the following questions? 

1. Because *apoptosis* would kill most ERV-containing cells, why is it that we still have so many ERVs hundreds of thousands of years after supposedly being inserted by retroviruses? (Also: is this assumption true?)

2. Are there more cases of similar ERV’s between species that are thought to be related, besides of apes and humans?

3. Another problem for the evolutionary explanation is that very similar ERVs exist in unrelated animals:

&gt;We have sequenced and characterized an endogenous type D retrovirus, which we have named TvERV(D), from the genome of an Australian marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Intact TvERV(D) gag, pro, pol, and env open reading frames were detected in the possum genome. TvERV(D) was classified as a type D retrovirus, most closely related to those of Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and mice, based on phylogenetic analyses and genetic organization.”[13]

&gt;“For instance gamma-retrovirus was isolated from trophoblastic cells of the baboon placenta. This virus was found to be very closely related antigenically and by sequence homology to the endogenous RD114 virus in cats (which is itself unrelated to endogenous FeLV). Benveniste and Todaro observed, like we did for jungle fowl, that only certain species of the cat genus, Felis, possessed this endogenous genome related to the baboon ERV. In contrast, all species of baboons carry this virus so it would appear to have been present in the germ line of primates much longer than in cats. Thus it seems evident that a horizontal, infectious event occurred to transfer the virus from baboons to cats, whereupon it became endogenous in the new species.”[14]

&gt;How do the authors “explain” this?
“Since cats would be quite likely to scavenge and feed on baboon placentae, a possible exposure to the virus can be envisioned.”[14]

Is this the case and how often are similar ERV’s found in (according to evolution theory) non related animals? And is there a difference in similarity between the ERV’s found in the unrelated animals and related animals?

4) What proves that the ERV’s found in the related species are in fact injected by retroviruses?

Basically I’m interested in your responses to this article: http://evolutiondismantled.com/ervs

Perhaps:

A) The article has errors and/or straw man fallacies 

B) The article shows that the explanations for the falsifications of the ERV Theory are ad hoc/non falsifiable theirselves and/or based upon other evidence for evolution (which would remove ERV theory from the list of evidence). 

C) Scientific answers are available to the questions

121,To a claim in r/creation on missing fossils and phylogeny,10,True,"This is just a quick reply to a comment  in /r/Creation, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7r74ht/could_we_put_a_list_of_arguments_against/dsuqvyr/) in which u/tom-n-texas  claims 
&gt;The common ancestors between higher classes of animals are missing. Dogs and cats, for example had to share a common ancestor. But where is this fossil creature? Same with horses and cows. Elephants and giraffes. Humans and chimps. Etc etc. but they're all missing. 

The crown ancestor to cats and dogs were [Miacids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacoidea) of which there are a decent number of fossils discovered and they are unequivocally containing basal ""transitional"" features of both cats and dogs. This took only 2 minutes to find, I went to Wikipedia's page on [Carnivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora#Phylogeny) and clicked around the phylogeny section, boom really easy.  

As for the other examples I just had to dig a little deeper. Humans and chimps, there are quite a few fossils of more basal creature to those, see [wikipedia again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homininae#Taxonomic_classification) or more specifically this [one species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierolapithecus) which is exactly what you ask for. 


As for Elephants and Giraffes, that is really a sign of how little you know on this subject, those trees connect as far back as two extant mammal lineages can be while still both being Placental, [see this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal#Molecular_classification_of_placentals), so their common ancestor would be all the way back to one of the [Eutheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria) (a classification so old that its was named by Gill/ Huxley back in the 1880s) 

Horses and Cows? Those are an odd toed and an even toed ungulates respectively so you are looking for a very basal ungulate in the [condylarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condylarth) family, which is currently a bit cluttered and foggy exact were everything goes, so somehow here you got one right, I cannot find the definitive fossil that links cows and horses together, but all the other ones you asked for were pretty simple to find. 

For fun I look at Phylogentic trees of life like [this](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer), [that](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html/@Euryarchaeota=635958?vis=spiral#x398,y455,w0.4086),  [this other one here](http://tolweb.org/Animals/2374), or just the phylogeny section of clades in Wikipedia.  All based on some combination of vast amount overlapping morphological structures, genetics, embryological/infant development, and fossil records of basically every step, do we have perfect records covering every species?, no, but scientist have discovered far more [transition fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils) (and this list is very incomplete) than you know about or is needed to demonstrate their existence.  

He continues with
&gt;Despite the fact that these common ancestors evolved after the dinosaurs died out. We find all kinds of Dino fossils right up near the surface of the ground. And thus we should be finding these mammal common ancestors at or above the layers where the Dino's are. But again the evidence for evolution is never to be found. 
     

A proper explanation for this would require a more deep dive into the geology of uplift, erosion and other mechanics of surface features but the short version is that only a very small amount of the layers holding dinosaurs fossils are near the surface (usually in desolate rocky places like the Mongolian Desert or the Dakota Badlands), so anywhere that we can find the mammal fossils in question the dinosaur fossils will be buried inaccessibly deep underneath them, large excavations of rock is not really an efficient manner for archaeology departments to find fossils. Though as u/denisova constantly points out with his copy-paste Grand Canyon layering speel, there is plenty of diversity within a single column of rock. YEC flood geology has far more layering issues than actual scientific models, it YEC is correct then we should find fossil whales in the same layers as trilobites, tigers near dromaeosaurs, and bats and modern birds next to Pterosaurs, but those haven't been found. If you really think that there is no [evidence for evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent) or for the [earth being old](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation) then yall got a hell of a lot of well supported science to overthrow. 

Now, does anyone still want to claim that transitional fossils haven't been found?",1516279473,93,2018-01-18 07:44:33
122,"Evolutionists, I have a question for you...",0,True,"Evolutionists, I have a question for you...

If you meet the following criteria:

1.) You claim that since no one can prove God's existence or non-existence, you are an agnostic;

2.) You claim that proper science is based on the Methodological Naturalism Presupposition (and this also means that you do *not* claim to be a Philosophical Naturalist, else the BDMNP would be superfluous);

then:

Since the BDMNP superintends over your science, it cannot itself be scientific, and furthermore, your science only considers natural causes as candidates for the causes of natural phenomena, even though you cannot rule out supernatural causation.

Again, you cannot rule out supernatural agency; therefore you must be able to deal with the possibility of existential supernatural causation in our natural world.

So, let's assume for a moment that a supernatural agent **did in fact** kick-start (i.e., was the cause of) the first life. What would your science look like in this case? Having ruled out *a priori* the real cause of the first life, you must wander about aimlessly, trying to concoct a plausible naturalistic cause, even though none exists. In the end, you would have to settle for the least improbable natural cause, no matter how improbable it is in absolute terms.

No amount of ""scientific"" evidence could ever convince you that life had a supernatural cause (even though it did), and you would descend into endless quibbles over which natural cause was most likely (read: least unlikely) to be the actual cause, when in fact none of them were.

I've been asking about this for some time, and haven't every gotten a straight answer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does irreducible complexity include apply to instances including *just* selection for beneficial states, or are other processes, like drift, recombination, and duplication involved? Does it only apply to instances of constant fitness landscapes, or are variable fitness landscapes also included?

If the answers to these questions are ""just selection, and just constant landscapes,"" then IC is wrong because it omits a giant chunk of evolutionary processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

If it applies even including the full range of evolutionary processes, is the claim that *no* IC system can evolve? If that is the case, then it is wrong because we have observed the evolution of systems that meet the criteria for IC.

&amp;nbsp;

Or is the claim only that *some* systems that meet these criteria cannot evolve? If that is the case, then it is an unfalsifiable argument from ignorance; anything with a documented or observed evolutionary pathway could of course have evolved, but there will always be something that we haven't figured out yet which could be claimed as IC.

126,"This is what counts as ""brilliant"" to creationists? Okay...",9,True,"So this story starts with the publication of a piece by DI hack Stephen Meyer in which he present no original data, but claims that the Cambrian Explosion is best explained by design. Identity of designer? Mechanism of design? No no, jus ""design,"" and leave it at that, thank you very much. 

Now, there are clearly some problems here, and the paper was ultimately pulled, because maybe we shouldn't be publishing half-developed ideas with no data beyond ""gee things sure are complicated,"" but that's not going to stop esteemed talk-downer and Very Smart Person David Berlinski from [bemoaning the state of Big Science](http://www.discovery.org/a/2450), and it is this bemoaning that has r/creation in a tizzy over Berlinski being ""brilliant, as always"". 

So let's see what Berlisnki says.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The suggestion that Darwin's theory of evolution is like theories in the serious sciences — quantum electrodynamics, say — is grotesque. Quantum electrodynamics is accurate to thirteen unyielding decimal places. Darwin's theory makes no tight quantitative predictions at all.

I feel like *Tiktaalik* alone is enough to refute this one, but just to dot the i's there's also the remnants of telomeres and centromeres in human chromosome 2. Neat, specific predictions that were subsequently confirmed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Field studies attempting to measure natural selection inevitably report weak to non-existent selection effects. 

I feel like someone should remind him about antibiotic and pesticide resistance. I particularly like the part where we [experimentally determined likely pathways to resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462546/) based on the selective advantage conferred by combinations of mutations, and then one of those novel resistance genotypes later appeared naturally. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Darwin's theory is open at one end since there are no plausible account for the origins of life.

[Ahem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ssv4s/abiogenesis_hypothesis_and_evidence_of/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The astonishing and irreducible complexity of various cellular structures has not yet successfully been described, let alone explained.

[Ahem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61nda6/the_irreducible_complexity_is_not_a_valid/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;A great many species enter the fossil record trailing no obvious ancestors and depart for Valhalla leaving no obvious descendents. 

God of the [literal] gaps. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Where attempts to replicate Darwinian evolution on the computer have been successful, they have not used classical Darwinian principles, and where they have used such principles, they have not been successful.

Oh he's taking John Sanford seriously, that's adorable. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that what David Berlinski considers valid principles are not what evolutionary biologists consider the same. I'm confident in this suggestion because no evolutionary biologists consider ""classical"" Darwinian evolution (which I can only guess means evolution involving *only* mutation and selection) a reasonable representation of how evolution works. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tens of thousands of fruit flies have come and gone in laboratory experiments, and every last one of them has remained a fruit fly to the end, all efforts to see the miracle of speciation unavailing. 

I don't know why he thinks a fruit fly would evolve into something else in an environment designed specifically to raise fruit flies, but okay, the claim is speciation can't happen. Sigh. Central African cichlids, apple maggot flies, European blackcaps, HIV...and these are just examples that humans have directly observed. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The remarkable similarity in the genome of a great many organisms suggests that there is at bottom only one living system; but how then to account for the astonishing differences between human beings and their near relatives — differences that remain obvious to anyone who has visited a zoo?

Differences in gene sequence, gene regulation and expression patterns, and development? It's like he's never actually studied evolutionary biology. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's it. Those are his arguments. I know. Tell me about it. I could be making three times my salary turning out this drivel for DI. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, let's put aside for a moment that literally every point Berlinski makes is invalid. Maybe he's just upset, and the denizens of r/creation with him, that design theory is being shut out of the scientific discussion unfairly, and the contributions and potential advances made by design theory to our understand of the world are being suppressed. 

But considering Berlinksi's piece was published in 2005 and creationists are still citing it as ""brilliant,"" I feel like that probably isn't the case. ",1515989126,17,2018-01-14 23:05:26

Why is the universe or life, with all its functions (systems of cause and effect), laws and complexity, and our intelligence and ability to invent things, not evidence for a intelligent entity that created the universe?


I assume:
Because the first two are testable and the latter is not? 

And if so, how are we sure the tests about the first two are really related to the subjects of the first two, and how would we be sure in the third case?",1515924350,75,2018-01-14 05:05:50
129,Special pleading,0,True,"I took some time to read the comments to my previous posts and red some interesting views on the subject. Since I am mainly trying to figure out what I should believe, those were very welcome. Thanks all. 

I also had the chance to see why the arguments were unneceserely complex. I tried to rephrase it to a new argument. I hope y’all can take a look and tell me if the argumentation are right or wrong:

Cause argument:

1. Cause and effect for empirical observable things is a strong law 
2. The universe is a empirically observable thing 
3. The universe is probably caused
4. Universe started at time X, according to science

This means that:
A) The universe is self caused 
B) An non empirically observable entity like God caused the universe. 
C) Uncaused X caused the universe

A
1 We have examples of empirically observable things
2 We only have examples of caused empirically observable things (law of cause and effect)
3 We have no examples of any self caused empirically observable things or evidence for uncaused empirically observable things. 
4 Science suggests the universe has a beginnig

Thus A = special pleading because it is limited by what we currently know (about causal relationships and the universe)

B
1 We have no direct examples of Gods (this is impossible by definition)
2 we have no examples of caused gods 
3 we have no examples of uncaused gods 

Thus B is special pleading because we have no direct evidence for B (but not limited by what we know)

C) We have no examples of uncaused X

Thus C = special pleading because we have no evidence 

Considering A is not
probable because our knowledge about the universe shows the unlikelihood, B and C are better options. 

Now personally I wonder, what else could it be a good explanation than an conscious intelligent creator? (A)

Why does it makes sense to imagine B?

The following:

1. We design things (humans, animals)
2. Something has to be infinite/uncaused, according to the first argument
3. There is no reason to assume that what exists is limited to the empirical 

= possibility for assuming an eternal/uncaused designer

1) Assume we have evidence for a Creator of life forms (which could be God or aliens) but no evidence for them specifically creating life on earth. 

2) Taking this into account, does the evidence we have right now show species A) diverged from a single common ancestor, or does it indicate that B) this ‘creator’ created each ‘specie’ (assuming species are created as groups), and that evolution can only occur in a very limited way, within ‘species’.

135,Crosspost: What are some predictions of ID theory?,7,True,"From [you-know-where.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7pyfzy/what_are_some_predictions_of_id_theory/) 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;1) that we will find specified complexity in biology. One special easily detectable form of specified complexity is irreducible complexity. We can test design by trying to reverse engineer biological structures to determine if there is an ""irreducible core.""

First, [IC is hogwash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61nda6/the_irreducible_complexity_is_not_a_valid/) Nobody has yet been able to explain where my rebuttal fails, but I'll keep posting it in case anyone wants to take a swing. 

Second, define ""irreducible core"" and describe an experiment or study that can be used to identify it. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;2) rapid appearance of complexity in the fossil record

Geological and evolutionary processes explain the ""rapid"" appearance of new traits. Unless you think fossilization is easy and/or adaptive radiation isn't a thing. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;3) re-usage of similar parts in different systems (i.e., different types of organisms), (Seperated itself from evolution in that genes that contradict a single phylogenetic tree don't get explained away with HGT or convergent evolution.)

I don't understand what the parenthetical means, but this comment as a whole sure sounds like creationists are trying to co-opt evidence of common *ancestry* as evidence of common *design*. The difference is that we have observed the processes and mechanisms that lead to common ancestry. No mechanism of design has ever been proposed. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;4) function for biological structures. Each of these predictions may be tested--and have been confirmed through testing!( I take this as meaning that most of the genome should be functional)

In other words, no junk DNA, no vestigiality. 

...Do I really need to refute this again? Explain what SINES, LINES, ERVs, and pseudogenes do. (Or, like, the entire onion genome...) Explain the function for dandelion flowers, human tonsils, kiwi wings, and on and on and on.

The evolution of placental gestation is one of those things.

Well here's another piece of the puzzle: Modulation of the inflammatory immune response during embryo implantation in the uterine wall. 

So in addition to changes to gene sequence (i.e. mutation), we also have the evolution of syncytins (via HGT) and changes to the inflammatory response (via regulatory changes). And these changes were selected for because they contributed to greater offspring survival compared to marsupial mammals. 

See, creationists? More than one mechanism operating at a time and interacting resulting in a complex novel trait. It isn't magic. ",1515630999,83,2018-01-10 19:36:39
138,To the r/creation post on feathered dinosaurs,11,True,"Specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7ox17t/any_intellectual_or_scientist_here_saurian_sim/), where u/cutebabybunnies is trying rile up some creationists to ""correct"" some early access indie game on Steam because it contains feathered dinosaurs. 


&gt;Most of them just think this is the new fact of science so it would help alot if Christians subscribe to their steam forum and game or discord and chat with them with out arguments. 

First of all, the idea of birds being a subset of and descendant from dinosaurs is not a new idea, in fact it was one of the first confirmed predictions of Darwin after his treatise on evolution was published. After looking at the traits of modern birds and fossil dinosaurs and noticing certain similarities in bone structure he predicted that there should be fossils found with intermediate traits in between, including hip shape, toothed mouth to beak transition, and feathered arm with fingers to fused wing. Just a couple of years after publishing ""On the Origins of Species ""archaeopteryx was discovered satisfying all of his predictions. 

But archaeopteryx was not the only dinosaur that we know had feathers, only the first one, since then [dozens of fossils with feathers have been discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dinosaur_species_preserved_with_evidence_of_feathers) mostly small dinosaurs but also some fairly large ones like [Yutyrannus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutyrannus), which was estimated to be about 3 tons when alive,. There are also finds of fluffy down and quill like structures in other non therapod dinosaurs lineages, sources [here](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140724-feathered-siberia-dinosaur-scales-science/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosaurus). 

&gt; Anyone interested? If no one speaks then most of the gaming community in Saurian is just going to believe that trex had feathered and well they came from birds and they also sounded like a soft duck.

Another species of dinosaur with feathers is [this fella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilong_paradoxus) who seems to be basal to all [Tyrannosauroidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosauroidea), so yes T-rex was probably feathered. I should put emphasis here that scientists think (and can show with a surprising large number of fossils) that birds came from dinosaurs and are a subset of therapod dinosaurs, not the other way around. 

In short please keep your creationism away from gaming, it seems that those developers know more about science than you do. ",1515421370,39,2018-01-08 09:22:50
139,Views of theistic evolutionists needed,7,True,"Hi, I'm looking for someone who considers him/herself to be a theistic evolutionist (christian). I used to be a creationism-believer, but have experienced serious doubts about my faith in general. One of the reasons was the (in my eyes) irreconcilable findings of biology: evolution and an old-earth. 

But because I'm actually interested in how to reconcile the writings in the Bible (original sin, adam and eve, garden of eden) with evolution I'm currently looking into the various views that people have on how evolution (and that it may not contradict the Bible). 

So 2 main questions I have for you:
1) Do you think there was a literal Adam and Eve? (If yes: how do you picture this? Did God pick two 'human-like' creatures that had become 'evolved enough' or something, and gave them a soul?)

2) How do you view original sin in your world-view? Was there an actual place that was 'perfect' or is original sin something 'symbolic' (e.g., our mistakes are due to our evolutionary history)?

140,"For years we asked ""what are kinds"", Turns out AIG had them in archive",4,True,"Oh yes,  baraminology, the idea that the phylogeny works just fine for ancestry, infidelity tests, species, genura, family and sometimes even order levels of the phylogenetic tree of life, but completely breaks down when used on any phylogenetic category higher? The idea that large scale evolution is impossible, except for super-duper-fast evolution since the Flood that stopped before anyone noticed?

That by using the same genetic methods that give us relationship diagrams like [this](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer), [that](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html/@Euryarchaeota=635958?vis=spiral#x398,y455,w0.4086) or [another one](http://tolweb.org/Animals/2374)
and by ignoring the vast amount overlapping morphological structures, genetics, embryological/infant development, and fossil records of basically every step, one can just trim the tree at roughly the sub-family level, and everything works out just fine?

Turns out that Answers In Genesis went an subdivided a decent chunk of the EVILutionist's phylogentic tree into the Orchard of [Baramin 'kinds'](https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/determining-the-ark-kinds/), they got [Snakes, tuataras, and worm lizards](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-extant-tuatara-amphisbaena-and-snake-kinds/), proper [lizards](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/initial-estimation-numbers-and-identification-of-order-squamata/), [birds](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-of-avian-ark-kinds/), [mammals](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/), [frogs](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-the-frog-kinds-on-the-ark-order-anura/), other [amphibians](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/identifying-and-numbering-amphibian-kinds-results/""), and [turtles and crocodiles](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-the-ark-turtle-and-crocodile-kinds/). Along with some other interesting choices by looking at fossil [amphibians](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/fossil-baramins-noahs-ark-amphibians/) (they just describe each family and move on) and a weird article where they constuct a tree for [blood flukes](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/baraminic-study-blood-flukes-family-schistosomatidae/) which is just bizarre in how it looks like a well documented science overview, it really struck home why so many creationists are fooled by AIG and similar sites, they state the science around and about the topic of interest but before they actually make a revolutionary, scientifically interesting claim/experiment/actual rebuttal, the article ends.  

Apparently they have been there for a quite a few years, the articles were published October 2012 to Febuary 2014. I am kind of surprised that no one has pulled them while I've been on this sub, looks like it got mentioned 2 years ago in this comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3w568m/a_challenge_to_creationists_how_many_kinds_are/cxu0hml/) on a discussion of 'kinds' , but did not get any further comments. 

The issues with their orchards should be fairly obvious, sniping 'kinds' off of the phylogentics tree with no real justification as to why there and not elsewhere, all of the similarities between, by every metric we have, closely related creatures becoming completely unrelated 'kinds',  the necessary super fast evolution to get to the current number of species (especially given the incredible limited gene-pool of just 1 or 7 pairs of creatures), fossils of more basal creatures in two separated ""kinds""  are almost impossible to place into just one category (""the dog-bears were bear 'kind'."", ""No they were dog 'kind'!""), the absurd number of new kinds needed to include all of the known extinct genera, and countless more.  

They also still fall into the issue of having all cats being of the same 'kind' leading to   evolution (ops, I must have meant ""adaption"") having to have happened in a even more supercharged speed than for the rest of the animals to get the feline kind separated enough for both house cats and lions to have their likeness carved into Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian art (some were even [mummified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_mummy)). A timescale that by using AIG's time of the flood 2348 BC and Egyptian civilization springing up after (yes I know that Archaeologists say that by that time the great pyramids would have probably already been fully constructed, but since when have experts in a field been trustworthy 
 /s) was at most generous 1000 years, this can probably be push even tighter by someone who actually knows anything about Egyptian and Sumerian art, or by the bible itself in which [Judah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+49.9&amp;version=NIV) (great grandson of Abraham) is described by his father as a lion. 

There so much more fundamentally wrong with their breakdown of the Phylogentic tree, I would very much like to see the criticism from someone who really knows one of the clades that AIG broke into kinds. ",1515231581,17,2018-01-06 04:39:41

I legit had a laughing fit for a good 10 minutes.  Usually I like to simply disagree with the points that I have problems with, but this actually caught me fully off-guard.  I really thought it was satire until cordova started agreeing with it and defending it.  

Now, it's not exactly as crazy as it might look, but it's going to REALLY show off just how pseudo-scientific creationism can get, this time reaching into UFO and abduction stories.  The main issue with this is that this was already an entirely different area of crazy that already had its own issues.  

The second trailer linked in particular features an abduction story later into it where the man is unable to move and terrified, and then wakes up in a panic.  This could be demons manipulating him, or it could be **sleep paralysis, as has already been used to debunk loads of abduction bullshit**.  

Anyway, I think this constitutes ""going over the edge,"" and I expect this will be the only time I cross a creation post onto here.  Then again, creationists are more prone to fall into conspiracy-style beliefs than most demographics, particularly on the extreme end, so...

EDIT:  Bonus points for his reply, in which he implicitly admits that the entire thing is targeting vulnerable populations (talk to conspiracy theorists, and you will know why I do not respect them; then again, duping them into bullshit for gain isn't exactly something I'm opposed to, as I've somewhat lost hope in the ability to help them).

143,How would one respond to this?,10,True,"So I was reading through an Intelligent desgin article: https://evolutionnews.org/2009/04/_why_evolution_is_false/

In this article the author says, ""It turns out that no series of fossils can provide evidence for Darwinian descent with modification. Even in the case of living species, buried remains cannot generally be used to establish ancestor-descendant relationships. Imagine finding two human skeletons in the same grave, one about thirty years older than the other. Was the older individual the parent of the younger? Without written genealogical records and identifying marks (or in some cases DNA), it is impossible to answer the question. And in this case we would be dealing with two skeletons from the same species that are only a generation apart and from the same location. With fossils from different species that are now extinct, and widely separated in time and space, there is no way to establish that one is the ancestor of another–no matter how many transitional fossils we find.In 1978, Gareth Nelson of the American Museum of Natural History wrote: 'The idea that one can go to the fossil record and expect to empirically recover an ancestor-descendant sequence, be it of species, genera, families, or whatever, has been, and continues to be, a pernicious illusion.'13 Nature science writer Henry Gee wrote in 1999 that 'no fossil is buried with its birth certificate.' When we call new fossil discoveries 'missing links,' it is 'as if the chain of ancestry and descent were a real object for our contemplation, and not what it really is: a completely human invention created after the fact, shaped to accord with human prejudices.' Gee concluded: 'To take a line of fossils and claim that they represent a lineage is not a scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime story–amusing, perhaps even instructive, but not scientific.'""

I have also heard the example used that if the different dog breeds we have today were fossils scientists would say how a chuwawa evolved into a great dane.

Even though Sanford [repeatedly lies about his sources](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/stan-4/), /u/nomenmeum insists ""I could find no way that Dawkins’s analogy is better than Sanford’s"" when comparing Sanford's analogy of wagons and starships, and Dawkin's sentence of ""METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL."" Dawkins openly admits that his analogy is not that great because it assumes the conclusion, something that evolution does not do, but he uses it to illustrate how selection makes evolution anything but random.

Sanford's analogy, though, also fails, because it assumes that selection will only work on the best of the simpler features, not guide them into something more complex. For example, if one of these wagons was able to grow wings, then it could get air if it got up to the proper speed. If nothing selected against wings, the wings would continue to survive like any other neutral wagon trait. But once utilized and improved the wagon's ability to travel, that trait would propagate far better.

Creationists on /r/creation love to have these imaginary battles based on their ignorance of science, promoting charlatans like Sanford who keep pushing their discredited ideas, banking on the fact that creationists love being lied to as long as it fits their beliefs, yet not one of those people on /r/creation can ever properly defend their points of view against those who understand what they're talking about.

More replies: 

&gt;No James, the problem begins with your inability to explain whether or not you believe that killing a man is the same as killing a dog. Lots of scientific blindness stems from moral blindness.

&gt;You say that the dice argument proves nothing without giving even the slightest reason. Note clearly too that I am not demanding that you agree with me. Not at all.  But I do require you to answer my argument with a counter argument rather than mere baseless denial devoid of data or argument. 

&gt;Your response is a classic Evolutionist’s response. It is nothing better than a strategy called, “Deny the evidence, move the discussion to another topic and hope the evidence is forgotten.”

&gt;Also I do not believe your responses to other questions are not based on anything more than internet searches of critics of Creationists. I have a hard time actually believing you think about the information you quote. You give little indication of any critical assessment in any case.

&gt;When I point out the dishonesty and falsification of evidence by Evolutionists including Dawkins, you do not see it as important. But when you find in your internet searches that,  for example Wells has one wrong view, that in your mind destroys his credibility on all other issues. Remind me James, your Ph. D. is in what field? What a pity you do not do react to Dawkins and others in the same way you react to Wells, since if you applied the same standards to Dawkins and co. you would have rejected their arguments long ago.

&gt;I am not interested in continuing the discussions with you any longer on these terms. You only appear willing to cut and paste from the internet, mostly in my view very uncritically. 

&gt;And when  I cannot present counter arguments to the numerous cut and pastes, which would require me to have in depth knowledge from several areas of science to Ph.D level and still be to explain it in terms that a higher schooler, even a bright one like you, can understand, you accuse me of not being willing to engage. I must point out again that I have a 48 hour per work engineering job.

&gt;Although you cannot even explain the mechanism of how C14 is generated in the atmosphere you pretend to understand how C14 could have contaminated coal, since in your view coal must be as old as Evolutionists need it to be.  You appear to believe that being able to memorise scientific terminology and to repeat it, is the same understanding it and being able to analyse the claims surrounding it. But without even the basis knowledge of how C14 is generated how do you believe you understand the proposed contamination mechanisms? And when I point out that at least some of these proposed contamination mechanisms are patently foolish, for example, contamination by mining equipment, you ignore the science and move on to your next “gotcha quote.”

&gt;You may call my unwillingness to continue our discussion on these subjects as a refusal to engage but it is not. I am willing but when you deny evidence and claim to know more than Francis Crick when he points out how little power to predict Evolution has, there is no rational point to our discussions. 

&gt;You read a book entitled “Irrefutable” yet by definition, indeed clear definition the fact that even Dawkins himself says the he doesn’t have all the answers he (not me but Dawkins himself) sees a need for, then his theory is not proven. A theory not proven is by definition not irrefutable. 

&gt;When you are willing to answer whether why you think killing a man is different to killing a dog, we can pick our discussions again. Until that time I have nothing more to say to you on this topic.
 
See how he just ignores most of my arguments?

On fossil skulls.

&gt;No James, you did not present me with fossil skulls, You showed me a photo of reconstructed skulls lined up on line for a book.
No dates.
No proof of the ancestry of one to the other. 
No mention that they were found thousands of kilometres apart. 
No mention of how much of the “skull” is original bone or original fossil, and how much is plaster.

&gt;You don’t wish to remember the frauds we have already discovered do you? Piltdown Man, Peking Man, Nebraska Man...?

&gt;Are all these skulls frauds? NO! But a photo of a row of reconstructed skulls, devoid of even the most basic details or location, % of plaster, confirmed dates as per above, is not a row of actual skulls.

&gt;The quote I gave you below shows that what you see in books as the artist’s impressions, is sometimes deliberately constructed as propaganda. The artist admitted that he deliberately drew this ape-man face to show what the ape-man would become. 

&gt;If you search the net for artists impressions of Neanderthals you will find such a wide variation in appearance that you will prove my point for me.

Regarding Vestigiality:

&gt;It was your quote and you boasted that Creationism had been put to death in 1912 or words to that effect.

&gt;Never the less you claimed via the quote that there were instances of human vestigial organs being put into, or pressed into some other role.

&gt;Apart from the appendix, name one human vestigial organ. 
Name its original function. 
Name its new function. 
Provide evidence that it adapted from its original function to its new function. 
Provide evidence that the organ did not have multiple roles built into it from the start.

&gt;And of course, what is the proof that the appendix is vestigial, i.e. not doing anything important as a leftover organ?

&gt;This is yet another instance of where you quote a quote, build a straw man argument and then when questions are asked of you and your quote, you ignore the obvious and return with a different quote from some other source. And you claim Creationists do not engage in the debate!  

At church this evening, Bruce also refused to engage in further discussion, so I just asked him stuff about agnosticism, everyone who didn't hear about Jesus, and handed him the password to one of my alt accounts on reddit. 

Oh, and I asked him about kinds and information.

**Kinds:**

Although he refused to elaborate, I did hear something to the effect of **a group of organisms which can only breed with each other.**

After gathering stuff from the comments section, I sent him a reply, requesting sources, snowflakes look designed, God is not nice to Canaanites, etc. . . 

Here's the response:

&gt;I didn't ask God what His view was. I asked you.

&gt;Do you think killing a dog is that same as killing a man?

&gt;What do YOU think?

&gt;This is the question you refuse to answer.

How am I supposed to convince him that morality has nothing to do with science?!?!?

After suggesting theistic evolution:

&gt;When you face up to the inevitable moral consequences of Evolution, then we can discuss why, in my view God neither did not could due to His character use Evolution to create the world.

Whatever happened to, ""God works in mysterious ways?""

&gt;But do not use this last sentence as a way of avoiding giving your answer to, ""Do you think killing a dog is that same as killing a man?""

*sigh*

In response to mutation and natural selection being the mechanism to generate information:

&gt;But you still have not addressed the facts James. The mathematical facts illustrated in the dice example.  Instead you continue to deal in slogans..Creationism is Intelligent Design which is Creationism rebranded.....

Now, I know that this sounds like heresy to you people, but talking to him in person is like talking to Saruman.

Bruce: Do you agree with Crick that the Evolution is very poor at predicting anything?

Me: No. (By the way, I'm not sure if Crick is getting quote mined or not in *What Mad Pursuit,* as I haven't read it, and talkorigins is null on it.)

Bruce: Do you agree with Crick that the evidence of design has to be continually ignored in order to believe in Evolution?

Me: No.

Now, I probably should have done my research and specifically pointed out organized complexity and hunted down the quote mining, but I didn't. 

His response:

&gt;Now, on what basis (evidence) do you as a high schooler (without even a B.Sc, let alone a Ph.D. and as far as you have told me no Noble Prize, or are you simply being modest?) , disagree with Crisk one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA?

He's even got the cheek to question MY qualifications, despite him being an electrical engineer who happened to take a course on biology and geology!!! 

He also promised to deliver on his claim that Dawkins couldn't provide an information generating mechanism. Somewhat odd, seeing as he's wrote entire books on the topic.

I'm fairly sure Bruce is recollecting a certain interview where Dawkins was duped by creationists and then edited to look like he changed the subject.

When I checked my inbox, there was a whole bunch of creationist material. 

First of all, a demand to see the numerous vestigial organs alluded to in one of my quotes from talkorigins. Sadly, I've been procastinating. 

&gt;By the way, I am still waiting for the “many instances” where some organ(s) of the human body has “pressed into some other service” though they were parts that are “clearly vestigial”. You remember the quote from your doctor friend from about 1912 or something like it? 

&gt;May I ask again, which “clearly vestigial” organs or parts did the doctor mention? (So far you have not mentioned none.) How did the doctor know they were vestigial? (So far you have offered no proof of the organs being vestigial.)


I looked at the original quote:

&gt;""The vermiform appendage—in which some recent medical writers have vainly endeavoured to find a utility—is the shrunken remainder of a large and normal intestine of a remote ancestor. This interpretation of it would stand even if it were found to have a certain use in the human body. Vestigial organs are sometimes pressed into a secondary use when their original function has been lost.""

Joseph McCabe 
The Story of Evolution (1912), p. 264

I'm not sure if he read the whole book, but where this ""many instances"" came from is a bit mystifying.

Quoting Dawkins:

&gt;At one point in that debate Lennox observed that, due to the complexities of life, the word miracle comes up frequently in origin of life studies, and there’s no way that natural forces can explain those complexities. 



&gt;Dawkins responded by saying, “Well, you’re asserting that there is no way. We don’t yet know what it is because there’s a lot of work yet to be done. Science doesn’t yet know everything. There are still gaps.” How does Dawkins know science will close those gaps? He doesn’t. He has faith. He is committing the “natural law of the gaps” fallacy. Dawkins has faith that one day we will find a natural cause for digital information. Skeptic Michael Shermer shares Dawkins’ faith. In his debate with John Lennox, Shermer asserted that we ought to give science fifty more years before drawing any conclusion....”



&gt;From “Stealing from God”, Frank Turek. 



&gt;I am sure there are more quotes like this where Dawkins admits that he knows of no mechanism for creating design from randomness, but I could be wrong....I will keep searching.

Just to clarify: I'm certain that there is no such quote, or that it's a quote mine. Should I tell him?

This paper has a few glaring issues that I saw (much like other purported ""science"" papers that creationists have attempted to sneak in trying to undercut evolution).

One part is this:

&gt; This distribution used by Kimura only accounts for deleterious mutations. He points out: “Note that in this formulation, we disregard beneficial mutants, and restrict our consideration only to deleterious and neutral mutations. Admittedly, this is an oversimplification, but as I shall show later, a model assuming that beneficial mutations also arise at a constant rate independent of environmental changes leads to unrealistic results” (Kimura 1979).

Kimura 1979 is this paper: http://www.pnas.org/content/76/7/3440.short

It appears that Sanford and Basener only pull out the one part of the paper that they wanted, and ignored the rest.

If anyone else can access these papers they cite, it would be interesting how much cherry picking and deception this paper includes.

157,A little help with this email?,4,True,"Bruce is up to his usual antics once more, asking me the difference between killing dogs and people. I told him that they were different species. 

I got this monster reply:

&gt;Hi *****,

&gt;So it is wrong to kill a different species but not wrong to kill a member of your own species?

 &gt;By your logic it is wrong to kill a dog, which is a different species to humans but not wrong to kill a human if you are a human.

&gt;This is one of the biggest problems with Evolutionary thought. 

&gt;Evolutionists refuse, or are unable, to follow their conclusions to where they logically lead. An Evolutionist will say there is no God but will pretend there is an absolute morality. This is your current problem. You know that to kill a man is different to killing a dog. But because you believe in Evolution you cannot have moral absolutes, since moral absolutes cannot arise from random processes. You know that absolutes can only arise from the Absolute. You have to refuse to follow your logical thought to where it inevitably leads, to the foot of the Absolute One.

&gt;And you end up therefore in all kinds of wafly arguments. On what basis is it wrong for a member of one species to kill a member of another? That is how, after all we got here. We got here, if you believe in Evolution because our ancestors were better thieves, murderers, rapists and killers of our own species because they out performed and out competed those unlucky ape-men who didn't have our better killing skills. And we dominated because we were are to hunt and kill other species for food. Either way, we got here because we are good at killing anything competing with us.

&gt;Kill a dog or a child and what is the difference, if by doing so I further my own survival and that of my offspring.

&gt;It is no use pointing out that this is what is happening today.  The question is, ""Is it morally right to  literally kill the competition and, if they are tasty to eat them, even if this means cannibalism?""





&gt;Now for predictions, Evolution cannot make predictions with any more reliability than a horoscope, and horoscopes are typically vague and sometimes appear to be correct.

**NOTE:** The predictions Bruce is talking about were copypasted from a comment here. 

&gt;If you make a single prediction and get that single prediction right then you have proved nothing, particularly if the prediction is a simple one, like you semi-toothed whale prediction. When the designers of the surface of the racing yacht wanted to improve the keel surface they first tried to make it absolutely smooth. The they took another approach; they looked in Nature and copied the surface of the skin of a shark.

&gt;Now if this idea had been suggested by a Creationist he could have said, “God has made sharks to swim very well. Let’s look at their skins and see if we can learn anything.” He would then claim justification for his prediction and may claim this as a proof for creationism. If however the first person who thought of the idea was an Evolutionist, he might have said , “Over billions of years Evolution has given the shark a low friction surface. Let’s see if we can copy the shark’s skin.”

&gt;Clearly, neither argument is a proof. Both are untestable claims but the one who got in first may confuse being first with being correct. That’s what your claim based on the discovery of a semi-toothed whale “argument” is. Untestable. Unrepeatable. And Evolutionists got in first.

&gt;To prove the predictive power of a system, you have to run a double blind trial wit ha number of events.

&gt;Besides, like Dawkins, you may well say that despite the lack of evidence, juts give Evolution another 50 years and the needed evidence will surface. That’s what he claims about the lack of any known mechanism to generate information out of chance.

&gt;Dawkins does not propose a mechanism for example by which a blind monkey randomly strikes keys on a key board and produces an essay about the evils of people smuggling, in Mongolian. Nor could Dawkins do this, but he wants you to believe that the information contained in the DNA which is hundreds of times more complex than an essay in Mongolian, cam about by blind chance, without the aid of a blind monkey an a word-processor.

&gt;Moreover, as I have said above, Dawkins admits he knows of no way to generate information by random processes. And for this reason, his only suggestion is to just have faith and in the future, we will discover this mechanism.

&gt;If you know of a mechanism to generate information from random events, you might like to inform Professor Dawkins, because he openly states he knows of no such process.

&gt;You made another claim the other day, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism?” Again this is not an argument. I could equally say that Evolutionism is simple Mother Earth God religion relabeled. Neither statement is an argument. 

&gt;You may prefer your statement, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism” to my mathematical argument. 

&gt;But I will ask you again, ”Suppose I have 10 dice. I randomly shake them and throw them onto a table. All come up sixes. I do this again. They all come up sixes again. I do it a third time and they all come up sixes again.” 

&gt;Now you could believe that all this happened by blind chance and indeed it could have. There is 1 chance in 6 to the power 30 of this happening. i.e. 1 chance in 221,073,919,720,733,000,000,000.

&gt;Now, in the second part of the experiment I throw another three lots of 10 dice. And I just get a mixture of numbers, but never the long string of sixes. (Which by the way is what you secretly expected. Not just now but every time I throw 10 dice.You know random produces random. You know that random processes does not produce order.)

&gt;Anyway, so you could either believe that the 30 sixes was a mere chance event but I am sure you would not believe this. I am sure you would be wondering how I fixed the dice or whether I had 10 loaded dice which I secretly swapped for 10 normal dice between the first three throws and the second three throws.

&gt;Yet for any of the so-called simplest life form (there is no simple life form!) to have evolved by dead, blind, chance, you need much greater luck that 30 sixes in a row. Vastly greater luck. You do not believe in 30 dice coming up 6 in a row but you do believe in vastly less likely events. And not just one such event, but countless events where chance produced an eye, a liver, a heart with four chambers, kidneys, skin, bones, a digestive tract…… and by random processes also equipped these organs with the ability to repair themselves.

&gt;So, *****, instead of replying with, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism” you might like to propose a mechanism by which information is randomly generated, randomly encoded and then somehow read and understood by another randomly generated system.

&gt;You see, for the monkey to randomly bash away at the keys and write in Mongolian, the language of Mongolian must have been pre-existent and there must have been someone who could read it and decipher it. How else would we know what the monkey was writing was Mongolian, in the regional dialect of NW Mongolia with a few loan words of Siberian thrown in? There must be information existing, then encoded into some method and then the decoding must be done by someone who knows that the writing is information and makes sense if read.

&gt;To believe in Evolution as the source of design information, as Dawkins does is like saying, “The monkey randomly striking keys on a computer, is in fact typing information. He does not know what the information is, since he himself cannot read it and I cannot read it either but I assume it is information somehow. I assume that what the monkey writes is, in reality information, which I will be able to read someday in the future. This must be so since I refuse to accept that there is an Intelligent Designer behind the design.”

 &gt;But Francis Crick let the cat of out the bag on intelligent design.

&gt;""Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved. It might be thought, therefore, that evolutionary arguments would play a large part in guiding biological research, but this is far from the case. It is difficult enough to study what is happening now. To figure out exactly what happened in evolution is even more difficult. Thus evolutionary achievements can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research, but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood."" 1988

&gt;Note that Francis Crick, with all his decades of Noble-prize wining experience,  cannot trust his scientific mind when it tells him what is in front of him is evidence of intelligent design. He must CONTINUALLY remind himself….. So the evidence is so compelling, so convincing that Crick has to CONTINUALLY remind himself tht despite the evidence for Intelligent Design there is no design, only chance. Not once, not now and then, but CONTINUALLY.

&gt;Further, Crick points out:

  &gt;    evolutionary achievements can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research (Hints are not evidence and certainly not proofs)
      &gt;  but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. (highly dangerous!)
        &gt; It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood. (He fails to state how often the processes well understood.)
Do you agree with Dawkins, i.e. there are no known methods of producing information from random processes.

&gt;Do you agree with Crick that the Evolution is very poor at predicting anything?

&gt;Do you agree with Crick that the evidence of design has to be continually ignored in order to believe in Evolution?

158,"Creationists on Review: ""Out of the Mouth of Babes"" or ""Why Are Fish Still Fish?""",13,True,"[""Out of the Mouth of Babes: Common Sense About Fish, Fossils, and Evolution""](https://crev.info/2017/12/common-sense-evolution/)

Brief overview: Sal is back, and he dusts off some old favourites pandering to an audience who needs a lot of reassurance but has no intellectual ability to factcheck. In this episode, he asks the favourite ""if man evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" Except in this case, it's man from fish. Let's hit the highpoints of this tiny, tiny little article written by a small, small man.

&gt;Given that a shark can take 18 years to mature, using 20 years as an approximate time for a generational cycle, the “fossil” shark underwent about 400,000 generations and was still a shark! This raises the question why should we expect any fish even after a few million generations to become an eagle as the Darwinists insist is the case?

Because there's such a thing as a niche, and that's what powers evolutionary change: if you're the best basketball player playing the game, you don't retire to play golf. Creatures like sharks are apex predators in the ocean, an environment which pretty much hasn't generated a new niche in a billion years: they don't need to change. The counter example is that many birds fall into [the mammal niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo) when no mammals are around to do so. Similar effects power island gigantism, which is a fun effect where normally small creatures become much larger on islands, where the isolated environment allows them a niche normally that normally excludes them.

Similarly, before there were land-based animals, there were just all these plants, hanging out there, all tasty, on land. No one there to eat it. Seems like something would want to fill that niche. Seems like a good one.

&gt;I spent the last 3 months arguing on the internet with evolutionary biologists including a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Joe Felsenstein. They could never explain why, in light of the evidence of “living fossils,” they would expect after N-generations a fish would be anything other than a fish.

Notice how he hasn't posted the correspondence? I wonder what that looks like.

It seems this isn't the first time he and Felsenstein have sparred. There are traces across the Internet of their previous encounters, and it seems like Sal hasn't picked up any new tricks. I can't find the conversation in question, but I suspect Felsenstein did what I normally do, and simply give up dealing with people who don't understand the simplest of terms when it doesn't agree with Genesis.

Otherwise, I could trivially explain it: there is a genetic difference between fish and non-fish that represent stuff that you need for land. Limbs and lungs come to mind. We can calculate that difference and suggest the minimum number of generations. See, unlike Sal, I understand that mutations happen and genomes change, and thus a fish might not always be a fish, even if most fish are going to remain fish. If a fish develops the full human genome, it's not going to stay a fish.

&gt;Once upon a time, there were these fish called Sarcopterygiians. One of the Sarcopterygiians was a lungfish, one was a coelacanth, and the other had no name—no exact fossil—but remains a missing link to this day.  This missing link called some sort of Tetrapodomorpha (‘four-footed shape’).

[Okay, well, that's a misrepresentation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopterygii#Evolution)

We'll ignore that his pathway of descent isn't great, but *Tetrapodomorpha* isn't missing. We do have examples, there are numerous species found in the fossil record. If you're asking which one is at the root: does it even matter? I've never met your great-grandfather, but I don't imagine your entire family was just magicked into existence.

&gt;So I kept pressing my evolutionary opponents, “why does the lungfish stay a lungfish for hundreds of millions of years, the coelacanth a coelacanth for hundreds of millions of years, yet their sister Sarcopterygiian fish for which we have no fossil, and no exact description, and which you insist erased itself from the planet and left no fossil with a name, that supposedly looked like a fish – why did this mythical fish do something different than its sister fishes and evolve to become tens of thousands of creatures like turtles, parrots and giraffes?” I essentially said, “doesn’t something look amiss to you evolutionists?”

Do you notice he never mentions their replies? He never actually mentions their arguments, he just kind of glosses over the part where they reply.

Nothing is amiss. If the niche is taken, you can't just move into it. That there are animals on already means there are no real benefits to evolving into land dwellers again. So, those 1% that try it, they fail and die. The rest, they stay fish.

&gt;All of this reminded me of an incident a couple of years back. I was invited by some parents in my church to teach their kids about creation. I was explaining to the parents how Darwinists want to poison the kids’ minds by telling them, in essence, “your mommy and daddy came from a fish.” One of the children, a six year-old boy, overheard the conversation and said emphatically, “that’s stupid.”

And now he uses a kid for emotional payload. Good call.

You should get him to write more of your material. I bet he'd come up with fresher material.

At this past November’s Royal Society meeting, “New Trends in Evolutionary Biology,” the distinguished Austrian evolutionary theorist Gerd B. Müller gave the first presentation. As we’ve noted before, it was a devastating one for anyone who wants to think that, on the great questions of biological origins, orthodox evolutionary theory has got it all figured out. Instead, Müller pointed to gaping “explanatory deficits” in the theory. Now the Royal Society’s journal Interface Focus offers a special issue collecting articles based on talks from the conference.

Let’s see what Dr. Müller has to say in an article titled, [“Why an extended evolutionary synthesis is necessary.”](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royfocus/7/5/20170015.full.pdf) A friend highlights the following paragraph, with his own emphasis added.

&gt; As can be noted from the listed principles, **current evolutionary theory** is predominantly oriented towards a genetic explanation of variation, and, except for some minor semantic modifications, this has not changed over the past seven or eight decades. Whatever lip service is paid to taking into account other factors than those traditionally accepted, we find that the theory, as presented in extant writings, concentrates on a limited set of evolutionary explananda, excluding the majority of those mentioned among the explanatory goals above. The theory **performs well with regard to the issues it concentrates on,** providing testable and abundantly confirmed predictions on the dynamics of genetic variation in evolving populations, on the gradual variation and adaptation of phenotypic traits, and on certain genetic features of speciation. If the explanation would stop here, no controversy would exist. **But it has become habitual in evolutionary biology to take population genetics as the privileged type of explanation of all evolutionary phenomena, thereby negating the fact that, on the one hand, not all of its predictions can be confirmed under all circumstances, and, on the other hand, a wealth of evolutionary phenomena remains excluded. For instance, the theory largely avoids the question of how the complex organizations of organismal structure, physiology, development or behavior — whose variation it describes — actually arise in evolution,** and it also provides no adequate means for including factors that are not part of the population genetic framework, such as developmental, systems theoretical, ecological or cultural influences.

160,What You Aren't Being Told About Astronomy: Volume II,6,True,"Creation Engineer Spike Psarris continues his video series on creation with this volume. Honestly, it was disappointing. There's no attempt to provide a creationist model. Just poking holes in current theories while playing choir music as he quotes Bible verses. 

Because Astronomers sometimes use the word evolution, Spike claims he can describe cosmological models as evolutionary models. 

While he might get away with this, his constant use of ""secular model"" and ""secular astronomers"" destroy his last shreds of credibility.

He explains the Big Bang with some nice cgi and a neat timeline. While he seems to be accurate as far as I can tell, the graphic reinforces the myth that the Big Bang was an explosion. 

**Star Formation:**

- Clouds of gas don't collapse into stars.

- Gravity cannot overcome gas pressure.

- Unless there is a container, gas will not compress.

- Besides that, there is also: rotation of the gas cloud, turbulent motion, and stray magnetic fields to deal with. 

- Secularists have come up with some explanations to account for this:

- Nearby supernovae compress the gas.

- Interstellar dust cools the gas clouds, reducing pressure.

- Galactic collisions might help. 

- Black hole's jets (the ones on the top and the bottom) hit gas clouds

- Radiation from nearby stars.

- All of these explanations assume the prior existence of stars. 

- New explanations rely on unobservable dark matter and dark energy

- Since we don't know much about this invisible stuff, atheists are free to assign any abilities to it.
**Galactic Formation:**

- Spike goes on to explain why ~~friendship is magic~~ galaxies can't form. 

- There's are a bunch of quotes from astronomers on why their model doesn't work.

- Mature galaxies are found far out. A 500 Million year old mature galaxy allegedly presents a problem for the Big Bang. 

**The Bible and the Universe:**

- Take Genesis literally. 

- Celestial bodies are predicted to have 3 purposes:

- signs and seasons

- sustain life

- declare God's glory.

- The sun is tilted to the plane of the ecliptic, so it can't have formed from a cloud of dust and gas.

- Fine tuning. 

- Stellar variety is not Stellar evolution.

- Blah blah blah dating assumptions something something interpretations. 

- Jeremiah said the stars were uncountable, contrary to the science of his day. We now know that there are 10^22 stars

- But Psalms says that they are finite. 

- The universe is finite. 

- Psalms claims that stars are all different from one another, so it was divinely inspired.

- The universe is huge. 

- Funnily enough, Spike explains what you would see if you were riding on a photon travelling from the sun, going so far as to point out that it would take you 100,000 years to travel across the galaxy. Ironic.

- Distant starlight is reserved for Volume III. 

**Message of the Heavens:**

- Atheists are confused. 

- Christians be like, ""God did it.""

- Evolutionary model fails. 

- Atheism is bleak. 

- Atheists are blind to design.

- Christianity is cheerful.

- Atheism says we are lonely.

- Christianity says we're special. 

- Look! The universe is big!

- Huge!

DarwinZDF42 suggested I start a specific discussion of this paper:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC150674/


&gt;Although the ultimate origins of RNA viruses are uncertain, it seems reasonable to assume that these infectious agents have a long evolutionary history, appearing with, or perhaps before, the first cellular life-forms (38). While the RNA viruses we see today may not date back quite this far, the evidence that some DNA viruses have evolved with their vertebrate hosts over many millions of years (24) makes an equally ancient history for RNA viruses a natural expectation. Yet a very different picture of RNA virus origins is painted if their gene sequences are compared; by using the best estimates for rates of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitution) and assuming an approximate molecular clock (21, 33), **it can be inferred that the families of RNA viruses circulating today could only have appeared very recently, probably not more than about 50,000 years ago. Hence, if evolutionary rates are accurate and relatively constant, present-day RNA viruses may have originated more recently than our own species.**

169,What you aren't told about astronomy: Volume I,3,True,"Another week, another discussion with my creationist friend Bruce.

It was somewhat surprising when he lent me a bunch of creationist DVDs, including two on astronomy. 

I asked him about it, and his response was basically, ""I can't answer all your questions on biology and geology, but here's some stuff on astronomy.""

The mind boggles.

Anyway, I watched the first volume today and took notes.

Former Engineer Spike Psarris (All creationists seem to be enigneers these days) was once in the military space program, so he's qualified to speak about such matters. Supposedly. 

The video constantly lambasts ""evolutionists"" for denying the Bible. This, of course ignores that astronomy has nothing to do with evolution. Also, what happened to the theistic evolutionists? Are they okay?

He starts off by defining evolution as everything that disagrees with creation. That was pretty much when my high hopes were dashed.

Under his logic, an old earth model is a secularist model. 

On the Nebular Hypothesis:

- Clumps of dust can't form into planets. Gravity is too weak.

Mercury:

- It's too dense than what evolutionary models predict

- Some scientists have proposed asteroid impacts to account for this. There is no evidence for this. (Note: Spike keeps playing a trumpet every time asteroids are invoked, ridiculing them. In contrast, peaceful, half assed gregorian chants play as he talks about creation. Propaganda.)

- Mercury has a magnetic field, contrary to the dynamo theory. 

- To maintain it, it requires a liquid core.

- But it should have frozen long ago.   

- New models! New problems!

- Mercury has volatile materials, such as lots of sulfur. This contradicts the large impact hypothesis, because they should have been vaporized. 

- The magnetic field is decaying, with a half life of about 320 years. 

- This was predicted by Humphreys.

- Mercury has ""blue hollows"" and escaping volatile materials, contradicting evolutionist's expectations.

- As this is still going on, Mercury must be young.

Venus:

- Despite allegedly forming under similar circumstances as earth, Venus is very, VERY different. 

- Its surface looks young. (Something to do with geologic activity)

- The cratering dating methods used to give an old age rely on flawed assumptions.

Earth:

- Magnetic field is decaying, halving every 1400 yrs. 

- This gives a maximum age of 20,000 years.

- Spike proceeds to ramble on and on about how earth is just perfect for life. 

- He also claims there is enough water in the oceans to cover the earth to a depth of 1.5 miles in the Flood. . . if the surface was smooth.

- Something something marine fossils on mountains.

- The amount of water on earth poses a problem because water can't condense close to the sun. 

- Comet bombardments don't work, because comet ice is abundant in deuterium, while it is rare here on earth.

- Asteroids don't work, because they contain the wrong chemicals and besides, they're mostly rock.

The Moon:

- The moon is placed just right for us to observe eclipses.

- There's something about ""ghost craters."" Not sure what he's talking about.

- If the moon was spun off of earth, the oceans would have boiled off.

- Moon rock is different from earth rock, so the earth and moon couldn't have condensed from the same nebula.

- Earth can't capture an asteroid because it would either hit the earth or just fly away. In other words, moon capture would require narrow paramaters.

- Computer simulations modelling this don't prove anything. 

- The moon has water, which should have been boiled off. 

- The moon is geologically active, which contradicts secularist models.

- Evolutionists adjusted the end of geologic activity on the moon from 3 billion years to 10 million years. Yep, they just can't let go of their millions of years.

- The moon is receding from earth at 3.8 cm per year.

- The figure would have been higher in the past.

- 1.5 billion years ago, the moon would be touching earth.

Mars:

- Evolutionists are hypocrites for claiming Mars was once flooded while mocking creationists. 

- Evolutionists are desperate to find alien life, even though abiogenesis is disproved.

- Wild speculations are taken as fact, to the point that when Spirit runs over a patch of sand, it ""hints at life.""

Jupiter:

- Not enough raw materials to form Jupiter. 

- The planet should have spiralled into the sun because of headwind.

- Argon, Krypton, and Xenon, are three times more abundant than what evolutionists predicted.

- Various rescuing devices, none of them work.

- IO is geologically active, so it must be young. 

- Ganymede has a magnetic field. 

- Evolution predicts stuff will be old, cold, and dead, they aren't

- Europa shows that crater dating is flawed because one impact can cause multiple craters.

Saturn:

- It's rings look weird and are inexplicable.

- An asteroid made them! See the pattern? 

- Saturn's symmetric field contradicts the dynamo theory. 

- Since it can't come from a dynamo, it must be young. 

- [Saturn suffers from the migration problem.](https://www.space.com/2206-death-spiral-theorists-cant-solar-systems.html)

- Enceladus has geysers that should have cooled down by now.

- Titan's methane should have broken down after a short time. 

- Evolutionists predicted vast methane oceans, there aren't any.

- Thousands of craters were predicted. Four were found.

- Janus and Epimetheus, or ""the dancing moons"" are to improbable to have arisen naturally, therefore God.

Uranus:

- Uranus rotates sideways. 

- No evidence of an asteroid impact, blah blah blah. . . 

- It's orbit is stable. 24 moons and a ring, all around the equator. 

- Uranus doesn't radiate energy, although it formed similarly to Jupiter.

- Humphreys predicted its magnetic field.

- Miranda (one of its moons) looks like a patchwork quilt. How do evolutionists explain this? Five asteroid impacts! Trumpet music!

Neptune:

- Neptune isn't old, cold, and dead, as predicted by evolutionists. 

- Accretion is to slow to form Neptune. It would take 10^10 years to form Neptune from a Nebula.

- Evolutionists are motivated to reject the Bible

- It's not Religion vs Science, 300(0?) scientists believe in creation!

Comets and Trans Neptunal Objects:

- TNO's have fresh ice from volcanic eruptions. 

- TNO's are geologically active.

- Oort cloud hasn't been observed, requires faith. 

- How did comet nuclei get so far out into the oort cloud? 

- Not enough nuclei 

- For some reason, the Oort cloud can't supply short period comets (I forgot why, my brain cells were dying.)

- And the Kuiper Belt couldn't have supplied comets.

- The Wild2 comet had the exact opposite composition than what was predicted by evolutionists.

- The Hubble Telescope looked for a predicted 85 comet nuclei. Three were found.

- Evolutionists keep changing their model.

- The Bible was right all along.

170,"RE new study on nervous system evolution: Oh my goodness, has *nobody* on r/creation studied evolution even a little? It's called ""deep homology,"" people.",4,True,"What's that you say? A group of biologists think we need to revise how we think [central nervous systems evolved](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08325-y)? Oh wow that's really interest...what? [You think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7lhw4g/yet_another_major_revision_tiny_sea_creatures/) this is a strike against evolutionary theory? Oh, bless your hearts. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the deal. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's this thing called *[deep homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_homology)*. It's when widely divergent organisms share the same trait, but not due to that trait being present in their common ancestor (this is called an *analogous trait*). But, for these traits, the same *genetic pathway* leads to the development of the trait in both lineages, which was inherited from their common ancestor (i.e. is homologous). So while the trait itself isn't homologous, the underlying developmental pathways *are*. Again, this is called *deep homology*.

&amp;nbsp;

This is *extremely* common. Here are two examples:

[Limb development in mammals and insects.](https://i.imgur.com/kJJDMUp.png)

[Eye development in everything that has eyes.](https://i.imgur.com/CWg3PdD.jpg) 

&amp;nbsp;

Oh look we [already knew the pathways involved for central nervous systems, too.](https://i.imgur.com/DnioEfK.png) Now we just know *more* about how CNSs evolved in different lineages. 

&amp;nbsp;

Only to creationists can more evidence about how something evolved be evidence *against* evolutionary theory.

(Also, isn't this, like, what creationists want? A detailed account of how something evolves from A to Z? Now we figure out a big piece of the puzzle and all of the sudden it's ""evolutionary theory called into question the sky is falling!"" Almost like they don't care about the facts, and just twist everything to oppose a theory they don't like.)

&amp;nbsp;

And one last addendum: The anti-evolution respondents so far on r/creation are arguing that this just shows how evolutionary theory isn't falsifiable. That isn't true. [Not even close.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6fpjr7/creationist_claim_evolutionary_theory_is_not/) ",1513961883,13,2017-12-22 11:58:03

172,(Important) Question about the spiral galaxy argument. One of the TOP TEN creationist arguments.,5,True,"I have been researching and dissecting the ""spiral galaxy argument"" often made by creationists. I have a few questions about spiral galaxies if you guys wouldn't mind answering them.

The spiral galaxy argument is explained in a [post] (http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE380.html) by talk.origns.""Stars closer to the center of a spiral galaxy orbit the galaxy faster than stars farther away. Over many millions of years, the difference in orbital rates should wind the spiral tighter and tighter. We do not see any evidence for this in galaxies of different ages."" This is called the winding up problem. The solution to this is density waves and this [article] (https://biologos.org/blogs/guest/are-spiral-galaxies-evidence-against-an-old-universe) from Biologos explains why the spiral galaxy argument is wrong.

So while researching this argument I have come across an answers in genesis [article] (https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/cosmology/galaxies-unexplained-spirals/) which states: ""Most astronomers currently think that this dark matter may allow galaxies’ spirals to survive. However, the best evidence for dark matter—the higher-than-expected rotation of the outer portions of galaxies—may actually make the winding problem worse, not better.""

I cannot understand why they say this. Why does dark matter make it worse? I am simply confused by their argument.

Besides, this [article](http://www.astronomy.com/news/2013/04/new-insights-on-how-spiral-galaxies-get-their-arms) states that ""The spiral arms are self-perpetuating, persistent, and surprisingly long-lived."" The article also says, the spiral arms of galaxies, ""can exist on their own through (the influence of) gravity, even in the extreme when the perturbations are no longer there."" So based off this research, spiral galaxies could survive on their own without dark matter. Correct?

Let's take a look at each top-level response, shall we?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm omitting a few that are either just links, don't present an argument, or are copied from the earlier thread on this topic. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Radioactive ""dating"" is actually in the creationist camp now. ...hydroplate theory. 

No. And also, everything would be dead.

This was pretty well hashed out in the other thread. No evidence for an alternative explanation. Just throwing stones. False dichotomy, if you want to be technical.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You want evidence for something? Do eye-witness accounts count as evidence? Then you have the Bible as evidence of creation.

Hahahaha good one. 

No, I don't have a more sophisticated counterargument. ""The Bible is the literal truth"" is the topic for debate. Assuming it is true isn't going to fly. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[long copy-paste of another user] - no junk DNA, different phylogenies for different genes, redundancy in genomes.

None of these are evidence *for* creation. Additionally, none of them are valid. 

There is junk DNA.

We know why different genes have different phylogenies. I literally devote a full class period to this topic every summer. 

Redundancy is expected via evolutionary processes, particularly gene and genome duplications. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Fine tuning argument.

Will there be anything new in these posts? Not yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For me, it’s the fact that there are lots of fossilized dead things laid down by flood all over the globe: plesiosaurs in Nebraska, seashells in the Grand Canyon, etc., which to me is evidence of the Genesis Flood.

Never heard of plate tectonics, I guess.

How simple those primordial organisms were, is there a limit to the simplicity? If yes - you admit that irreducible complexity is a valid biological concept. 

If you say that those organisms were *n*ot irreducibly complex - then we should be able to have even more simpler organisms and have darwinian evolution act upon it and produce novel functions.

And even more simpler organisms to the point they don't fit into the description of an organism.

So now we have non living material and evolutionary mechanism should be able to make it into living organisms.

To sum it up, **you admit irreducible complexity of simple primordial organisms when you leave abiogenesis out of Darwinian evolution.**

179,Is there a resource detailing human evolution step by step from bacteria to human,8,True,"Basically im looking for a cladogram or video showing step by step, clade to clade, species by species roadmap until we get to humans.

Im looking for something with a specific roadmap through the clades with examples of basal forms within that clade and details about what major new trait was modified or formed to create the new clade, so that I can show a gradual step by step process from worm-like animals to fully formed humans. 

My purpose is to show creationists how evolution is just gradual modifications of pre-existing structures, and if we follow these gradual modifications step by step, it eventually leads to humans. For example, we have mostly spineless fish without jaws (like hagfish) who eventually evolve so that one of their ribs gets folded allowing them to open and close their mouth, or how bat wings are literally just modified hands with webbed fingers which creates a wing. Or how horse hooves are just modified and enlarged single digits. Its easier to explain to creationists that evolution makes small changes and adaptations to already existing structures because most creationists already believe that, so if I can show them the gradual modifications of structures from the first forms of life to humans then I think we can maybe change some people's minds and educate people that evolution doesnt take faith at all and can be explained.

Since we can cross date tree rings, we can know when a false ring forms. So we would be able to know if a tree formed more than one ring.

I just saw this article. Many people have known for years how bad the Wikipedia article on Intelligent Design is. I've never seen a worse article more filled with falsehood and error. There's no point trying to fix it, as it seems to be controlled by a bunch of propagandists who've learned from the masters.  It's nice to see that intelligent people [(Larry Sanger)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Intelligent_design#My_$0.02_on_the_issue_of_bias) can see the lies and distortions even though they don't believe in ID. 

It would be nice to have a bit more objectivity. However, there are 85 !!!! archived talk pages, so this is not going to happen. The cabal who oppose an accurate explanation of ID have done a lot of work and will continue to do so (fighting for 85 pages).  

So, what do they do? They attack Sanger (""If your friends are homeopaths, creationists, global warming deniers and so on, you are going to be subjected to an endless conspiracist narrative in which Big Science is conspiring to do down ideas that challenge it."") , but they refuse to listen to anyone who tries to show where they are biased.

On irreducible complexity:

- Removing (possibly) redundant parts doesn’t falsify IC. 

- Keep removing parts to test if the flagella could have evolved. (I’m aware that this assumes constant selective pressure, but I wasn’t really in the mood)

I presented him with images of hominid skulls and requested his response.

- To show that they were missing links, you have to find them in the same area, say 100 or 1000 km apart. However, it’s not convincing if they’re 10,000 km apart. 

- Were they subjectively reconstructed? How much is original bone?

- The skulls were all apes or all men, in other words, variation in a man kind or ape kind. (He pointed out all the variation in churchmember’s skulls as evidence.)

- Lining up skulls does not prove common ancestry. 

As a follow up to my claims regarding human vestigial organs  being vestiges of previous organs (duh) he asked for examples. Unfortunately, I had failed in this regard. 

I told him about bacteria eating nylon.

- Discovering new enzymes doesn’t mean they evolved. Just because you can eat pizza doesn’t mean you evolved to eat it. 

- Prove that they can’t eat non nylon stuff. (Why he asks this is beyond me)

I presented an example of five different radio metric dating methods agreeing on one formation.

- You haven’t proved the earth is old.

- Five broken clocks will give the correct time if the test is repeated enough.

188,Question about intermediate forms,5,True,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m not here to debate you. I’m just here because I have a question I want to know more about!

I’ve learnt that geologist have found fossils in the ground, in the order of simple to more complex and/or in the order of different to more like the animals we see today (fish without bones, fish with bones, land animals, mammals). I agree this seems like the animals evolved from their primitive form. 

If this is indeed the case, we can assume that the animals changed gradually (maybe not with the same speed, but in relative terms). Now imagine we have a specie (I can’t be specific because I have not much knowledge on the matter, but I’m sure there’s one that fits my description), which we call B. Specie B is still alive today. We assume that B has an ancestral specie, which we call specie A. This animal is extinct today. 

Because A differs much from B (although they share traites, which suggestie them to be related) we would have to assume that there had been a lot of organisms between A and B that looked like both but gradually changed from A to B. We will call this group of morphing species, specie X. 

Now if the above is all the case, would we have to find *at least* an equal amount of X than as of A, right? Would this situation also require us to find more of X than of A? 

My second question is: if the above is the case, do geologists find the same when looking for intermediate forms? Do they find more/less of ‘specie A’ or more/less from ‘specie X’?",1513521081,19,2017-12-17 09:31:21

Edit:
The creationist I was talking to showed some words from an Indian language. Apparently the average length of their words are like 10-15 letters or something crazy like that. Also, they sight the fact that English doesn’t have masculine and feminine words.

Also, isn’t it wrong to say that evolution says everything is getting more complex. Clearly some animals have evolved to lose a function that once had. Evolution isn’t about a getting more complex, whatever is beneficial is what is favored. The simplifying of language is more efficient and would this be an improvement.",1513472531,26,2017-12-16 20:02:11
190,Leaving the Fold: Darwin’s Doubt and the Evolution of Protein Folds by Michael Buratovich,7,True,"This subreddit has recently seen discussion of philosopher of science Stephen Meyer's arguments that the relative rarity of protein folds in the space of potential poly-peptide combinations renders them inaccessible to the reach of natural selection.

In my view, Buratovich effectively shows, via survey of relevant literature, that folds are not as difficult to generate as Meyer implies.

One criticism: Buratovich says ""Meyer restricts his comments to amino acid substitutions that are often the result of DNA-based point mutations. However, those mutations that beset DNA are far more diverse than point mutations, and if we account for this vastly wider range of mutations, protein fold evolution becomes largely explicable.""

Meyer does discuss mechanisms such as exon shuffling, gene duplication and chimeric genes in the chapter ""Assume A Gene"".

200,A Buried Landscape: Burying the Flood,8,True,"Alright, as promised, here's my follow up to the surprise canyon formation post. Here we will discuss an entire buried landscape, and it's implications for Flood Geology. 

YEC Andrew Snelling lists [a lack or erosion](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/grand-canyon-facts/no-slow-and-gradual-erosion/) in the geologic record as one of the top six pieces of evidence for a Global Flood. To quote:

 &gt;If the fossil-bearing layers took hundreds of millions of years to accumulate, then we would expect to find many examples of weathering and erosion after successive layers were deposited. The boundaries between many sedimentary strata should be broken by lots of topographic relief with weathered surfaces. After all, shouldn’t millions of years worth of weathering and erosion follow each deposition?

&gt;On the other hand, the cataclysmic global Flood described in Genesis 7–8 would lead us to expect something much different. Most of the fossil-bearing layers would have accumulated in just over one year. Under such catastrophic conditions, even if land surfaces were briefly exposed to erosion, such erosion (called sheet erosion) would have been rapid and widespread, leaving behind flat and smooth surfaces. The erosion would not create the localized topographicrelief (hills and valleys) we see forming at today’s snail’s pace. **So, if the Genesis Flood caused the fossil-bearing geologic record, then we would only expect evidence of rapid or no erosion at the boundaries between sedimentary strata.**

(**my emphasis**)

This statement from Snelling gives us two crucial admissions from the creationists. First, surface topography in the rock record would exist if the rocks really were millions of years old. However, the Flood, by YEC's own admission, could NOT form such features. If we find ANY surface topography in the middle of their ""Flood"" deposits, then their flood didn't happen. 

So, do we find only flat boundaries between layers? Nope. Surface erosion abound in the rock record. Using Seismic imaging, we can create 3-D images of the rock's beneath our feet. Vibrations are sent down into the Earth, and when they hit rocks of a different composition, some come back, just like an ultrasound. When these are fed into a computer, some very interesting features are observed. My favorite example is provided [here](https://media.nature.com/full/nature-assets/ngeo/journal/v4/n8/images_article/ngeo1191-f2.jpg)

The picture comes from a paper by [Hartley et al](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Events/Past-Meeting-Resources/Poetry-and-Geology-A-Celebration/~/media/Files/GSL/shared/pdfs/library/Geopoetry/Hartley-et-al-2011.ashx), who found an entire ancient landscape, dating to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. This deeply incised landscape is cut into the 58.5–56-Myr-old Lamba formation, which consists of marine deltaic deposits whose flat topset units were deposited at sea level. This formation is largely unreflective and consists of mudstones and siltstones with occasional thin sandy layers. The eroded landscape has been infilled by the 2 56–54.5 Myr Flett and Balder formations. 

Not only does this run directly contrary to the predictions of Flood geology, it has several features present that are not expected if, magically, this somehow formed underwater. For one, observe the incision patterns. It features a branching dendritic pattern, which is charictaristic of terrestrial erosion, not submarine. I emailed Dr. Hartley for clarification on this, and he said: 

&gt;You're absolutely correct that the dendritic drainage patterns are characteristic of terrestrial river erosion, while submarine canyons can sometimes have similar patterns it would be unusual, particularly over such length scales.

So at the scale we're measuring, we can safely rule out this just being coincidentally formed underwater. Furthermore, the formation contains fossil soil horizons known as paleosols, along with coal and pollen. YECs, of course, dispute paleosols (for refutations of their claims, see [here](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/oard-2011/vega) ). But what are the chances that the flood would really deposit Coal, forge what seem to paleosols, and carve a landscape with things that just *look like* terrestrial drainage patterns all in the same place at the same time? 

An ounce of common sense shows this to be less than implausible. This story was all over the news in 2012, yet the YEC ministries didn't let out so much as a peep. I wonder why?

201,"The Surprise Canyon Formation: A not-so-little ""surprise"" for Flood Geology",12,True,"Hey all, 

So, as requested by /u/Denisova, here I will present my favorite piece of evidence against a global flood: The Surprise Canyon Formation. 

The Surprise Canyon Formation in the Grand Canyon is a spectacular example of a geologic feature which is inconsistent with Flood Geology. This formation is located in the grand canyon and consists of filled in channels cut into the Redwall Limestone. The erosional valleys form a stream network which becomes wider and deeper in a westerly direction, with the deepest measuring 401 feet. 

All kinds of fascinating fossils have been found in the Surprise Canyon Formation -- brachiopods (22 species), corals, bryozoans, mollusks (including univalves), echinoderms (i.e., starfish), and plant fossils. Fossils trees and logs have been found near the bottom, along with spores. The further up one goes, a transition from terrestrial to marine fossils is seen.

At the bottom of the paleovalleys filled with the Surprise Canyon Formation, a layer of conglomerate if found. The large rocks in the conglomerate are chunks of solid Redwall Limestone. We know their identity because, when these rocks are broken open, they contain fossils native to the Redwall, and not the Surprise Canyon Formation's own sediments. This means the Redwall must have already been solid when erosion occurred and the conglomerate formed. 

So what sequence of events would have to take place for the Surprise Canyon Formation to be formed?  First, you'd have to deposit the Redwall Limestone, have it lithify, then have the entire area uplifted at least 400 feet.  Then, the westward trending stream/valley network could be cut into the Redwall Limestone. Later, the entire area would have to be flooded by an advancing sea from the west (hence the marine fossils in upper portions of the formation). Later, the layers of the Supai Group would be deposited, starting with the Watahomigi Formation.  Then, after that, the rest of the Grand Canyon Layers.

Young Earth Creationists often point out that erosional features and buried surface topography should be found in the geologic record if it were formed over Millions of years. The Surprise Canyon Formation is an excellent example of this. But can YECs explain its existence? No. They've tried but they can't.

The only YEC I've seen to address the channels of the SCF is [Ariel Roth.](https://www.slideshare.net/arielroth/gc-1-reading) Roth merely calls on scouring of the still soft Redwall by underwater currents, which were then filled in. To quote:

&gt;Such suggestions tend to ignore the expectations of channel carving for Flood models.


In principal, sure, a flood could carve channels, maybe even deep channels. However, the idea that it could carve the SCF channels is falsified by the conglomerates at the base of the formation containing chunks of Redwall Limestone. Had the Redwall been soft, a mixing of sediments would be foreseeable, but chunks of rock already hardened to be eroded up? Not a chance.

YEC Emil Silvestru was the only other YEC to Address the conglomerate. His explanation? [Straight denial.](http://evolutionfairytale.com/forum/index.php?/topic/4928-questions-concerning-the-global-flood-models/page-2)

&gt;""As for the conglomerate with Redwall clasts, I need to see pictures and thin section identification of the clasts (confirming them being Redwall Limestone).""

Plenty of pictures [exist online.](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/40ce0536f8674824b4278a07b068bfa7/grand-canyon-trail-of-time-surprise-canyon-conglomerate-ha2dgm.jpg) 

As for thin sections specifically, I don't know if they were done. Likely they were, but they are not required to demonstrate their identity. We know that these rocks are from the Redwall because when you break into one of the chunks, they contain fossils unique to the Redwall, not native sediments of the Surprise Canyon Formation. Other analysis shows that the conglomerate chunks match the Surprise Canyon Formation in every way (See Billingsley, G. H. and Beus, S. S. eds., 1999, *Geology of the Surprise Canyon Formation of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, Museum of Northern Arizona Bulletin 61.* for details. This can be hard to get, I had to visit the Museum of North Arizona just to look at it, but it wasn't for sale. I'm still trying to get a copy in my hands.) The information is there, Silvestru just opted to outright deny it instead looking. Nice. 

So what are we left with? We have the remnants of a vast westward-draining river system preserved in the grand canyon. It's layers show a peaceful transition from land to marine life, and provide definitive proof the lower layers were hardened before incision took place. This runs directly counter to the predictions of Flood Geology, which predicts something like this couldn't exist. But it does. 

My next post will show an entire *buried landscape* which features the same problem.

209,Question about Evolution,3,True,"Hello Reddit,


I have a question about evolution. I am not a biologist by any means so I may be approaching this completely wrong but I have a background in electronics. So I am approaching this from a coding perspective. I was thinking about what the chance of the simplest DNA coming about is. So assuming that the essential ingredients for DNA are present and able to self-combine and assuming that this is a completely random process. The simplest know organism that I could find on google was a Nasuia deltocephalinicola which has 137 genes or 112,000 base pairs. Okay heres where the math starts


112,000 base pairs so that’s 224000 nucleobases. And each nucleobase can be 5 different bases (adenine, cyosine, guane, thymine, uracil)


So looking at this as coming about randomly wouldn’t that give you a chance of 1 in 5^224000 chance of happening? After realizing that that’s a big number (1.91x10^156569) I wanted to estimate how long that would take to happen. So I then hypothesised what if life can guess 1 trillion times a day so 1x10^9 guesses/day…that seems like a lot but hey this is all hypothetical. So we get


1.91x10^156569/1x10^9= 1.91x10^156560 days


That seemed crazy to me so I was wondering could that fit in the known length of the universe. The universe is estimated at 13.8 billion years. So let’s do some more math


((1.91x10^156560) days / 365days/year)/13.8 billion years= 3.79x10^156547 Universe lengths


That seems impossible to me… but as we know it could happen possibly. So let’s continue and assume this happened. The next simplest organism that I could find is a Carsonella Ruddii at 182 genes or 159662 base pairs. So assuming that this organism inherited all the previous genes (probably not the case but let’s just for assumptions sake) so 319324 nucleobases - 224000 nucleobases = 95324 “new” nucleobases so that gives a chance of 1 in 5^95324. After realizing that this is another very large number it got me thinking wouldn’t each mutation make it more and more less likely? For example let’s assume that this happened. So the chance of the first DNA happening is 1 in 1.91x10^156569 and the chance of the next mutation is 1 in 4.14x10^66628. So to get the chance of both of these we would need to times them 1.91x10^156569 x 4.14x10^66628 equals 7.91x10^223197.


So here’s my question wouldn’t these compounding chances make the life we see now impossible in 13.8 billions years (the known length of the universe)? What am I doing wrong? Is my math wrong? Am I looking at this wrong? How do we answer this?

210,Creationists just can't let carbon dating go,17,True,"/u/ChristianConspirator in this [thread](htts://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7goenu/carbon_dating_of_methuselah/)  in /r/creation is yet again making a mess from radiocarbon dating despite the attempts by /u/dzugavili to make him understand how it actually works.

So what do we got here.

&gt; When talking to evolutionists about dendrochronology they love to point to carbon calibration, particularly IntCal13, to suggest that the earth is old (More data here).

Sorry dude but radiocarbon dating *isn't* use to date the age of the earth. Its range, up to 50,000, in some occasions possibly 60,000 years does not suffice for geological purposes. We don't use medical thermometers in ovens to see if the meat is well baked.

Hence, radiocarbon dating is mostly applied in history science or archaeology.

&gt; So what's wrong with Methuselah? I have heard, though I've looked and cannot verify, that dating the oldest parts of these trees gives carbon dates that are erratic...

Carbon dating is *principally* not suited for dating living objects. It is explicitly excluded from from the list of applicable specimens for crucial methodological reasons. Only deceiving creationists who have not the slightest idea of what they tattle about, are the ones who manage to still date living objects with radiocarbon dating.

I think you should get yourself more knowledgeable about the things you deal with, don't you think?

But, actually, radiocarbon dating indeed has yielded abundantly all kinds and types of archaeological specimens to be older than 6,500 years. So it does falsify the 6,500 year old earth caboodle from the bible. Along with more than *hundred* other dating techniques (to be found [here](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/category/from-stars-to-stalagmites/age-of-earth/), [here](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/100-reasons-the-earth-is-old-reblogged-from-age-of-rocks/) and [here](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation)) that independently have found literally thousands of specimens of all sorts and nature to be older than 6,500 years. The idea of a 6,500 years earth is completely shot into pieces.

&gt; Obviously, when dead trees (without a witnessed death date) are used, there are assumptions involved that any young earth creationist would not accept. 

Of course ""just"" mention something like ""there are assumptions involved that any young earth creationist would not accept"" and then don't mention which ones exactly let alone explain and prove that these are to be discarded by flaws.

So, WHAT assumptions exactly?

&gt; that any young earth creationist would not accept"" ...

WHO CARES.

&gt; For example many of the trees are dated by the fact that they were buried in the Younger-Dryas event, which I believe is dated using ice cores. 

The end of the Younger Dryas has been dated by by a variety of methods with consistent results, including GRIP1 (11,500 year years before present) and GRIP2 (11,640 years ybp) ice core isotope measurements in Greenland, varved sediments from lake Krakenes (Norway, 11,530 ybp), Cariaco Basin core (Venezuela, 11,570 ybp) and German oak/pine dendrochronology (11,570 ybp as well).

Isn't it just be wonderful how calibration works, don't you agree?

Which BTW was not in my &gt; 100 list of falsifications of a 6,500 years old earth, so now it's &gt; 100 +1.

&gt; Whenever possible, you would think it would be more straightforward to use living trees, and there are two that I know of not too far from each other, along with a third that was cut down in the 60s.

Not particularly, other dating techniques are also valid and reliable. But, anyway, the end of the Younger Dryad *has* been measured using dendrochronological cross-dating, see the German oak/pine specimen above.

Your post is straight GARBAGE.

I watched this whole video. It was painful. 

The claim here is that genetics supports the notion that all of humanity is descended from the survivors of Noah’s flood, which occurred about 4400 years ago, give or take.  

No. 

Let’s see what claims are made by this purported expert and how they measure up. 

&amp;nbsp;

Starts by presupposing that the Bible accurately tells the history of the universe. That’s the starting point. 

&amp;nbsp;

Eight and a half minutes in, and there has been nothing of substance. Just going over the years of the flood and Babel, and estimating population sizes, an exercise that is completely arbitrary, by their own admission. 

&amp;nbsp;

Okay we’re twelve minutes in, and it’s all about population growth so far. Nothing about genetics, genetic diversity, etc. Just arguing that we can get seven billion people since the flood. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ah, here we go. Predictions: “1 Y (male) ancestor” and “1 mtDNA (female) ancestor”. 

Not a good start. That’s not what those things mean. We can determine the time to the Y-MRCA and the mtMRCA, but those are *not* single male and female ancestors of all extant humans. They are *only* the MRCAs for the Y chromosome and the mtDNA. That’s *it*. The rest of the genome has many other MRCAs. For example, the X chromosome MRCA lived [about half a million years ago](http://zums.ac.ir/files/genetics/test/seq_variation_in_a_non_coding_region_of_hx_chr_(1999\)_kaessmann_et_al.pdf), compared to 200 to 300 thousand years for the Y-MRCA, and even more recently for the mtMRCA. And he doesn’t even mention the disparities in the dates; just lies about what the terms mean and moves on. And yes, lies, since this guy claims to be an expert.

&amp;nbsp;

Prediction: Only two alleles per locus (since it all came from Adam, so if he’s heterozygous, only two alleles per locus. This is…not the case. I mean…wha?

&amp;nbsp;

Prediction: Dispersal of humans around the world all at once. Nope. It took at least 40 thousand years to get from leaving Africa to entering the Americas, for example. He also hilariously leaves out all the stuff about originating in Africa. He just handwaves that away.

Anything else?

&amp;nbsp;

Well, apparently completely without self-awareness, we get the claim that a human bottleneck with an effective population size of about 10 thousand would mean humans went extinct. No mention of how we survived a bottleneck of N=6 post-flood. 

&amp;nbsp;

And now there’s an absurd simulation showing how you go from having every allele present at 50%, to a situation where most loci are fixed. (He hilariously misinterprets some data here, apparently not understanding what “allele frequency” means, but whatever.) The simulation he uses shows what happens when genetic drift is driving changes in allele frequencies. It’s just modeling random fluctuations in a small population. That’s literally it. He then says “woah, this matches what we should see if the Bible was true! &lt;mindblown&gt;” 

&amp;nbsp;

OH MAN THEN HE GOES TO GENETIC ENTROPY. It’s like he’s trying to be wrong in every way all at once. 

[Nope.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/)

(Special shout-out to the Sanford flu paper. AMA about that paper. It’s *terrible*. Assumes constant fitness landscape, a single selective pressure, no interaction between flu strains, etc. Oh my goodness it’s terrible.)

&amp;nbsp;

Aaaaaaand that’s all, folks. Those are the genetic “arguments” for a literal creation and flood story. Ooof. What a sorry exercise.  

&amp;nbsp;

Creationists, do you really take this stuff seriously? This is a 26 minute video with in which *almost no* empirical claims are made. Those few that are made are egregiously wrong.

The ""experts,"" at least, should know better.",11,True,"[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7bm32d/the_excellent_though_unintentional_argument_for/) brought my attention to [this 1997 paper,](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14126594_A_high_observed_substitution_rate_in_the_human_mitochondrial_DNA_control_region) which was cited as evidence of a recent Biblical Eve by Dr. Georgia Purdom, one of several creationist con-artists selling her credentials to give credence to scientifically absurd ideas. The TLDR version is that the authors found that according to their methodology, the human mitochondrial most recent common ancestor existed 6500 years ago, in contrast to the generally-accepted date range of about 1-300kya. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are a bunch of reasons why these findings do not actually show this, and I want to first say that one can't fault random people on r/creation for not knowing that's the case or realizing why. Dr. Purdom is an expert, the authors are experts, why should one question the findings?

&amp;nbsp;

But Dr. Purdom should know better than to peddle shoddy work like this. Here's why you can't take that number at face value:

1. The used something called RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis to calculate the observed mutation rate. But this type of analysis ropes in more than just single-nucleotide substitutions (i.e. one base becomes another). Insertions and deletions can also lead to differences in RFLP. But we calculate convergence dates based on single-nucleotide changes, so this technique leads to a significant over-count of number of mutations that occur per unit time or per generation. 

2. They included in their analysis a region of the mitochondrial genome that does not show a constant mutation rate over time. But the goal, the thing we're doing here, is called molecular clock analysis. To work, the regions under analysis have to accumulate mutations at an approximately constant rate over the time interval of interest. Including a region that violates this principle invalidates the results. 

3. The design of this study fails to account for a phenomenon called heteroplasmy, which is when an individual inherits more than one mitochondrial genotype from their mother. This raises the *measured* mutation rate, but only because some mutations are double-counted. 

&amp;nbsp;

Subsequent studies using more careful techniques and more comprehensive datasets indicate an mtMRCA 150-200kya. This single outlier study is an enormous outlier because the techniques they used were not appropriate to address the question. [More details here](http://www.evolutionpages.com/Mitochondrial%20Eve.htm) if one is so inclined. 

&amp;nbsp;

And creationists who accept what people like Purdom and Jeanson at face value should be offended that these supposed experts will lie to them, using data that *they know is not valid*, because with their credentials, they will be believed, and those invalid data support the preconceptions of their audience. Shameful dishonesty on their part. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are some other problems with the OP on r/creation, but I'll let those slide for now, with one exception:

&gt;The reality of Mitochondrial Eve, that ancient female from whom all living humans have descended

That's not what Mitochondrial Eve is. mtEve is the *mitochondrial* MRCA. All extant *mitochondrial genomes* are descended from mtEve's mitochondrial genomes. But other parts of the genome are descended from other people, and there were lots of other people alive at the time, many of whom have extant descendants. mtEve represents the MRCA for just a small part of the DNA in each of our cells.

246,Darwin Meets the Berenstain Bears,11,True,"Hello everyone,

I'm reading a generally horrid and frustrating book right now called *Total Truth* by Nancy Pearcey.  It may come as a shock to you that a book containing Intelligent Design apologetics is actually a book about  having a conservative Christian worldview and fighting back against the inherently evil and misguided claims of secular culture.  I go to an awfully conservative Christian university where this book is a required reading.  I'm an *""evolutionist""* and an agnostic if it matters, just to be clear.  So big mistake on my part.  

Pearcey has a chapter in this book called Darwin Meets the Berenstain Bears* where she moves from demonstrating the commitment of scientific communities to the theory of evolution (no surprises there) to citing a few examples of where she thinks evolution does not stand up to scrutiny.  I'm wanting to get some better-informed opinions on these examples so I can completely and utterly destroy them in my book review and really piss off my professor.  I'm particularly looking for thoughts on points 1, 3 and 5 as the others are pretty rudimentary and basically just me ranting/thinking out loud.

Here they are:

1.  **Darwin's Beaks**: I think(?) this is an easy one but I want to give you a feel for what we're dealing with.  Pearcey basic transcribes this passage from Phillip Johnson's WSJ article,  [The Church of Darwin](http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/chofdarwin.htm) -

  &gt; Here's just one example of how real science is replaced by flim-flam. The standard textbook example of natural selection involves a species of finches in the Galapagos, whose beaks have been measured over many years. In 1977 a drought killed most of the finches, and the survivors had beaks slightly larger than before. The probable explanation was that larger-beaked birds had an advantage in eating the last tough seeds that remained. A few years later there was a flood, and after that the beak size went back to normal. Nothing new had appeared, and there was no directional change of any kind. Nonetheless, that is the most impressive example of natural selection at work that the Darwinists have been able to find after nearly a century and a half of searching.  

 She later mentions the HIV mutation scenario where the virus became resistant to drugs given a certain amount of time.  When the drugs were removed the changes were reserved, and to quote she says: 
 
 &gt; Such limited, reversible change is hardly evidence for a theory that requires *un*limited, directional change.

2.  **Dysfunctional Fruit Flies**: This is a pretty common objection to evolution I hear at my uni, which is that evolution can explain the *survival* but not the *arrival* of the fittest.  Pearcey refers to mutations in fruit flies that never actually *benefit* the fly such as bigger wings, smaller wings, no wings, four wings, etc.  She then posits that while these mutations are occurring, none of them are bringing *Musca domestica* anywhere in a macroevolutionary sense.  Talk Origins has a good rebuttal [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB101_2.html), but if anyone has any other examples, that'd be great.

3.  **Doctored Moths**:  This sections refers to the [Peppered Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution#Religious_controversy) controversy.  I'm not sure why Pearcey focuses so much on this experiment but I'd be curious to see if folks here validate the experiment or choose to focus on others.

4.  **Most Famous Fake**:  Pearcey uses this section to cast doubt on Haeckel's famous [embryo drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_drawing#Haeckel.27s_proponents_.28past_and_present.29).  She is also anxious to point out that Haeckel was, in fact, a racist and supported eugenics.  Nevertheless, even contemporaries like Stephen Jay Gould state that Haeckel's drawings are ""inaccurate and falsified.""  Again, Talk Origins offers a concise but effective [rebuttal.](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB701.html)

5.  **Science Strictly Presupposes Naturalism**:  Ironically, this book is assigned reading for a philosophy class.  Not a surprise that a quasi-theologian popularizer doesn't seem to know much about science.  She quotes Dawkins:

 &gt; Even if there were no actual evidence in favor of the Darwinian theory . . . we would still be justified in preferring it over all rival theories.

 Now I'd suspect that this quote is taken out of context ([it was](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/09/dembski-quote-m.html)).  Pearcey is, in part, trying to illustrate a supposed dogmatic commitment to evolutionary theory in the scientific community and uses all the above examples to show the eagerness of scientists to accept even shoddy evidence for evolution.  What are your thoughts on this charge?  It seems to me that evolution has gone through a lot of deserved changes in light of new evidences or hypotheses, but I'm no expert.  I also don't think that evolution contradicts religion despite my own views on metaphysics.

6. **Darwinism is a Religion**:  This claim just frustrated me and I don't think it requires explaining because it's silly.  The very man that creationists use to support this statement, scientist Michael Ruse, writes that: 

 &gt; ""Today's professional evolutionism is no more a secular religion than is industrial chemistry.""

That's the gist of it.  The biggest issue with the chapter in general is that Pearcy flagrantly ignores a lot of undisputed, positive evidence for evolution.  Furthermore, despite giving no positive evidence in favor of Intelligent Design, she goes to insist that it deserves an audience in the classroom and that it's silly to think the debate over our origins is over.  I think a big part of this chapter is trying to demonstrate ""reasonable doubt"" regarding evolutionary theory and I was curious what you guys would think about the specific examples I listed.  She does goes on to defend Intelligent Design in the next chapter ironically dubbed *The Science of Common Sense,* so if you're into being annoyed and underwhelmed, have [fun](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Truth-Study-Guide-Christianity/dp/1433502208).

Edit: should've copied the comment here:


&gt;""I left because intelligent design isn’t real"" lol. Hey, I took a decent amount of lectures on evolutionary biology and I would be willing to debate this. I am not your average creationist who tries to disprove evolution by using the bible or the Quran lol. But bring forth the evidence you believe exclusively supports evolution and lets' debate.

&gt;My proposition is that 5 out of 7 evolutionary predictions as written in the origin of species are false and that the final 2 predictions being homology and comparative DNA is compatible with creation theory.

&gt;1 - fossil record - [fail](http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/science/origin/04-cambrian-explosion.php)  even though [most life in pre-cambarian could fossilize and it was very very simple life even plenty were unicellular ](http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/precambrian.html), and post-cambarian was littered with complex life. No intermediate fossils between simple life and complex life = no evolution  or hoax evidence like piltdown man, nebraska man, peking man, etc. Trying to use undefinitive fossils to prove evolution thus becomes a formal logical fallacy called the [texas sharpshooter fallacy.](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/175/Texas-Sharpshooter-Fallacy)

&gt;2- comparative embryology  like [this](http://photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/56/102/92821651_XS.jpg) prediction, [fail](http://www.ichthus.info/Evolution/PICS/Richardson-embryos.jpg). In fact terrible [fail.](http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Haeckel--fraud%20not%20proven.pdf)

&gt;3- vestgials, horrible fail. Every single vestigial have found their function. We are only down to one, wisdom teeth. Even [appendix](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-function-of-the-human-appendix-did-it-once-have-a-purpose-that-has-since-been-lost/) and [coccyx](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/coccyx)  were knocked down. Some have tried to salvage this by saying ""vestigial =/= useless"" but that is not the original predicition and it fails because it makes massive unfalsifiable assumptions like assuming our extinct ancestors had this when there is no way to prove this without presupposing that we had a common ancestor which is circular reasnoning. Unless you would like to claim that vestigials is just same structure different functions but then it becomes homology not vestigial which is compatible with creation.

&gt;4- Pseudogenes. Fail. We are slowly finding out all their benefits and functions. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078729/       + https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593336/

&gt;like wnt3a for example thought to be useless. Now Science confirms that it is far from useless. It is responsible for tasks in the fields of embryonic development, neural development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. 

&gt;5- biogeography is, i would not say a complete fail, since frankly when I studied evolution, there were plenty of suvcesful exmaples of biogeography but that prediction is not always right.


&gt;6 -homology. Well structure is determined by DNA and comparative DNA is compatible with creation as shown below.


&gt;7- xomparative dna is probably the best line of evidence for evolution, though, creation theory similar to how if a creator creates a code in one organism and he likes it then he copies it and uses it in another organism or other organisms similar to how a coder might copy paste a code and use it in other parts of the program or use the same excellent code from one program in other programs

&gt;Antibiotic resistance has also been debunked since Bacteria did not evolve and gain new beneficial mechanisms through mutations but they gained these new mechanisms by in-taking already-existing plasmids from other bacteria that did not evolve. Antibiotic resistance plasmids are [ancient](http://easweb.eas.ualberta.ca/download/file/papers/paper_108.pdf) and they [definetly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881561) did not [evolve recently](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7365/full/nature10388.html?foxtrotcallback=true) in a lab by ways of mutations (evolutionary mechanism) in test-bacteria gaining new beneficial features.

&gt;Every single line of evidence for evolution. Every single one is absolutely worse than the one before. Although I can kind of sympathize with the comparative DNA argument, this line of evidence however can be explained under ID as well.

&gt;Edit: Even if evolution is true and they somehow digged up some extraordinary evidence over night, evolution would still prove God. Since Blind unguided naturalistic evolution is statistically impossible, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOJRSmrrM0o) is one out of many reasons why. As WLC quotes in the vid,  barrow and tipler in anthropic cosmological principle who calculated that the possibility of the evolution of human genome from a primate ancestor to be somewhere from 4^180^110000 to 4^360^110000 which needless to say is mathematically impossible due to violating borell's law. Moreover, there are 12 steps in human evolution, EACH of which is so improbable under naturalistoc chance that before even ONE can happen, it would take so much time by naturalistic chance that the sun would cease being a main sequence star and turn into a red giant .. which obviously has not happened yet meaning evolution is not and can not be due to naturalistic chance.  So if evolution is true and did happen and unguided evolution can not happen naturally and can only happen under the guidance of God (as proposed by theistic evolution), then God guided evolution and thus exists.

&gt;I think we can summarize it as follows. P1) Evolution happened  (not true but let's grant it) P2) Evolution is proposed to happen in two ways either naturally and unguided (atheist) or either guided by God (theistic evolutionist) P3) Unguided natural evolution can not happen (statistically impossible from ample research like [this](http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/polofsson/research/Chance.pdf) and Tipler and Barrow source quoted in the above video, as a couple examples among many)


&gt;Conclusion : Evolution is due to God and thus God exists.

Later he also wrote:

&gt; Did you know there is absolutely nothing writhing physics that allows everything to come out of absolutely nothing? Come debate. It will be proven to you with scientific factual evidence.

Well, Richard:

1. brilliant creationists talking about evolution is very rare because up to now I *hardly* have debated *evolution* with creationists but basically only *their* strawmen and devises.

2. one of these contortions is to confuse cosmology (the big bang theory about the singularity at the onset of the universe) with biology (evolution theory). So, that will be logical fallacy no. 1, a red herring.

3. so if you want to debate singularities and other phenomena related to the big bang theory, you should pose you question on a subreddit about cosmology or phydics or the like. There your nonsense will be made minced meat. But to save your ass against your own crap, read carefully the following before jumping to any of these subreddits: the big bang states that the onset of the universe was a state of highly dense and very hot energy (singularity). Highly dense and very hot energy is everything BUT nothing. When asked about what was before this initial state (the cause of the big bang), all relevatn scientists will say ""we don't know"". Some of them try to make sense out of it but those immediately will admit they are only making a guess. The ONLY ones that *actually* think that everything came from nothing are the religious. In theology it's called ""creation ex nihilo"", *creation out of nothing*. So, if you don't mind, when you want to debate this, don't even go to a subreddit on cosmology or physics but to /r/creation or the like. But, anyway, what we got here is flaw no. 2, a strawman and no. 3. criticizing someone else about something that actually belongs to your own stance. 

4. another thing is that I hardly engage any ""brilliant"" creationst. Creationists generally have no idea what they are tattling about, hence the contortions and strawmen under 1. I *hope* that your pastor is *a lot* more brilliant than you because your tattles are crap and caboodle.

Then this:

&gt; I do except evidence and it supports the biblical creation account more than the evolutionist theory that has never been proven. 

I think the typo here must have been a Freudian slip, I think you intended to say that you *accept* evidence but YOU DON'T. You will *only* accept the evidence that affirms the Bronze Age mythology book.

In SCIENCE the support for biblical creation is nihil and virtually absent. But for evolution theory the evidence is overwhelming. Biologists consider evolution as the main frame uniting theory of their discipline.

But, to say that there is no evidence for evolution is [a plain lie and straight deceit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent). Just saying. So we have here flaw no. 4. straight deceit (no evidence for evolution) and no. 5. lying (pretending to say that one accepts evidence) and no. 6. distortion (misrepresenting the actual state of affairs within science).",1509555559,74,2017-11-01 12:59:19

> Error catastrophe requires a very specific set of conditions . . . A sufficient percentage of mutations have to be harmful.

I'm not so sure about this, from the (few I must admit) works of population geneticists I've seen it seems that the amount of deleterious mutations per genome per generation is what matters, not the percentage necessarily.

> These conditions are so rare and specific that they have never, never been observed in natural populations.

Sure, it might be true that we've never observed the ""average rate of reproduction in a population to fall below 1"", but that doesn't necessarily mean anything, because only after a while of accumulation of deleterious mutations will the average rate of reproduction in a population fall below 1, the better test seems to be to just see if the fitness is declining due to mutation accumulation. And there seems to be 1 example of this:
https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v348/n6300/abs/348454a0.html

/u/darwinzdf42 has pointed out about previous examples I've given that they specifically try to minimise selection by bottleneck passaging, fair enough. This example doesn't explicitly mention that, but I can only see the abstract, so it might be another example like that. If that's the case, I will have to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate whether error catastrophe will occur for humans. In regards to Sanford's simulations, I will have to examine whether the rebuttals given by peeps here are valid.

> So we're looking at low-to-mid single digits for the percentage of mutations that are actually harmful in humans.

This [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004525) gives a figure of 8.2% of the genome that is sequence-specific. Population Geneticist Alexey Kondrashov, who's tried ""[A molecular approach to estimating the human deleterious mutation rate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.1380020312/abstract)"", gives a figure of 10 deleterious mutations per genome per generation in his book ""[Crumbling Genome: The Impact of Deleterious Mutations on Humans]
(https://www.amazon.com/Crumbling-Genome-Impact-Deleterious-Mutations/dp/1118952111/)""

> But then you add in the effects of sexual reproduction and recombination. These allow us to decouple good mutations from bad ones, allowing the bad mutations to be removed via natural selection (i.e. individuals with bad mutations have lower reproductive success), meaning these mutations don't accumulate from generation to generation.

Sexual reproduction and recombination will certainly help to remove deleterious mutations, but I don't see how it, with combined selection, will remove *all* deleterious mutations, it seems to me that it will only remove *some*, and that others will still accumulate. Again, I'll also have to see if there are realistic simulations that include recombination and demonstrate whether error catastrophe will occur for humans.

> The argument creationists use in response to the above is that there are mutations called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" or VSDMs. Mutations that are harmful, but have such small effects that selection cannot remove them. So they accumulate over time and cause a decline in reproductive output over many many generations. There are a lot of problems with this argument. Let's go through them. First, fitness effects are context dependent. There are very few mutations that are inherently, universally beneficial or harmful. Fitness effects depend on the genetic and ecological context in which they occur. So if a mutation has no fitness effects, it isn't a VSDM. It's neutral. Period. Second, for VSDMs to be the drivers of error catastrophe, they have to accumulate slowly enough to not be subject to selection, but also rapidly enough to drive a decrease in fitness. But these two things cannot simultaneously occur. If they cause a decline in fitness, then the individuals with the VSDMs have fewer offspring, and those mutations become less common. Which means that in order for error catastrophe to happen, a large number of mutations have to occur in a single generation. But...

If the experiment I linked doesn't try to minimise selection than it seems to rebut these two points. If it does try to, then again, I'll have to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans.

> Third, if harmful mutations were accumulating, either very slowly or in a big burst, we'd see the effects: Reproductive output would decline. Needless to say, the number of humans keeps increasing. There is zero evidence of a global decline in fitness. Localized decreases in reproductive output are due to choices, not physiology.

The human population would not necessarily decline, this would only be the case after a long while of deleterious mutation accumulation, it wouldn't be apparent immediately. Human reproductive output, aka human population growth, nowadays seems to be more due to medicinal, agricultural, and technological advancements, not fitness.

Also, most population geneticists disagree with you that the human fitness is not declining. Here's three of them to start off with:

* http://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8380.full
* http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/961.full
* https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v336/n6198/abs/336435a0.html

> Given the lower density, lower mutation rates . . . there's zero chance we're experiencing error catastrophe.

As far as I know most population geneticists say that it's not the percentage of mutations that are deleterious that necessarily matters, but the amount of them per genome per generation. Likewise, the per nucleotide mutation rate doesn't matter, only the amount of deleterious mutations per genome per generation matters.

> The mutations have to have effects so minor, selection cannot act on them (i.e. they are neutral), but they also have to be harmful enough to cause not just a measurable decline in fitness over time, but a terminal decline in fitness over time. Those two things cannot simultaneously happen.

I don't see why the two can't happen simultaneously, the argument is that new deleterious mutations are being generated too fast for natural selection to remove all of them, it's that natural selection can only prevent the most deleterious mutations from accumulating, not all. Another way to examine this point is to again, see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans. 

> A mutation or set of mutations cannot simultaneously be effectively neutral and also cause a decline in reproductive output.

The argument is that natural selection can only prevent the most deleterious mutations from accumulating, not all. Another way to examine this point is to see if the experiment I linked doesn't try to minimise selection. And another one of course, again, is to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans.

260,There is no longer a point to arguing.,7,True,"So I was having a theology/creation and evolution debate with some of my friends at lunch. They constantly would dismiss every scientific argument I made. Explained to them how they do not have to believe that the earth is 6,000 years old and that the Bible might not mean literal 24-hour days (sun wasn't created till day 4 etc.) However, every single time I brought up an arugment regarding science and how we can know that the earth is older than 6,000 years old they would say that I ""don't have enough faith."" I explained to them how we have trees  sequences that go back farther than 6,000 old. I also explained how we can determine if more than 1 ring happens to form during a year by comparing the rings with previous trees and what not. They would simply dismiss this. They say that they are trusting, ""God's word"" and I am trusting ""Man's word."" There is simply know way to argue with this. I can prove to them the earth is not 6,000 years old, but they dismiss everything no matter what. It got to the point that, I asked one of the kids a question. I asked him whether or not he would keep believing the Bible if it said the earth was flat (I never claimed it actually did say that). The kid said he would. I went further and asked if he himself was taken into space and went around the earth and saw for himself that it was round, would he still believe the Bible? He said that he would. These people don't care what the facts are, they care about believing, not what's actually true. Even after all the evidence I provided they quoted the bible verse that says, ""For we live by faith, not by sight."" I don't think I will argue with them again. There is no way I can.

* Similarity in DNA can't be used as evidence in a common ancestor because the small percentage difference is the reason why animals are so different in forms and in their DNA control mechanisms

I feel like the banana DNA is going to be mentioned. But isn't the genetic similarity why humans and apes have such similar anatomy, instincts, and emotion? 

* Two species must have the same retrovirus in order to have the same common ancestor. (Brought up coelacanths and humans sharing no retroviruses)

I thought that not all species share the same retroviruses... 

* That ERVs are junk DNA because they have specific functions as a part of the control mechanism in a cell, so therefore, believes that the retroviral invasion in primate evolution never happened

How are ERVs junk DNA if this person explicitly mentioned that they aren't useless?

1.Flood legends

2.Big layers over continents

3.Out of order layers

4.Dino soft tissue

Towards the end he started telling me why plate tectonics was a lie. As soon as I pointed out things like the shapes of the continents and why modern YEC organizations accept plate tectonics, he went from really nice to very angry. Ten minutes later he stormed off, saying it's a matter over starting points. Keep in mind I did not get angry or sarcastic with him at all during this. 

Then the original guy and a few others who had apparently been listening got curious about tectonics and I ended up giving a miniature lecture on continental drift and why one should look for models with predictive power if there are competing explanations.

263,Theological arguments in support of Evolution:,1,True,"Here's this lovely piece, that defends evolution from a theological standpoint. 
http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1986/JASA3-86Murphy.html

Very important part: 
""We now move to our central topic of creation and its relationship with evolution. The evolutionary view can take seriously the biblical picture of humanity being formed from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7), in common with other living creatures (Ps. 104:20-30). It is their relationship with God which distinguishes human beings from other animals (Ps. 8). According to evolutionary theory, we bear in our bodies the history of our organic relationship with the rest of the bio- sphere. Evidence for this is supplied by embryology, by the commonality of the genetic code, the similarity of protein structures and the homological features of gross anatomy. From the standpoint of history and physical constitution, there is no sharp distinction between human beings and other animals.

With this in mind, we proceed to the argument for the theological superiority of evolution over creationism. Of course we must realize that arguments and proofs are always contingent upon certain presuppositions, so that it is important to make these as explicit as possible. The following form of the argument will be helpful:

(A) The whole creation is to be redeemed. (See 11(3) above.)

(B) What has not been assumed (i.e., taken up by God in the Incarnation) has not been redeemed. (See 11(4) above.)

(C) Because of (B), the whole creation cannot be redeemed unless it has been assumed. But (A) states that it is to be redeemed. Therefore the whole creation has been assumed in the Incarnation.

Creationism appears to allow no way for our conclusion to be satisfied. In that theory, humans are of a nature totally different and isolated from the natures of other creatures, so that the Incarnation ""can't touch"" non-humans. Evolution, however, says that humans are related to other creatures, sharing not only the same chemical elements and related structures, but also a common history. Thus evolution appears to provide the theologically superior understanding of creation.""",1509049196,7,2017-10-26 16:19:56

282,"Video from the echo chamber featuring my favorite bs artist, Nethaniel Jeanson, lying about things.",7,True,"Oh this guy. He lies a lot. I feel comfortable saying that because he has a PhD in cell biology, and knowing what goes in to something like that, he can't not know that what he says is all bs. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm going to break the claims in [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/759jm0/replacing_darwin_an_interview_with_nathaniel/) down categorically, because it jumps around a bit. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we start with a Darwin quote mine, and the quote isn’t even relevant since Darwin didn’t have neutral theory. So his formulation that evolutionary changes require selection at every step isn’t valid. But here we are with a purported expert lying about it this. 

Later on, he claims “Darwin’s test is as valid today as it was then,” which…no it isn’t. Darwin didn’t have neutral theory. We now know that many evolutionary changes are not driven by selection. Darwin thought differently, and he was wrong. So a statement made by Darwin based on this conclusion is in no way “as valid today as it was then.”

But then oh! We finally we got to neutral evolution. Which leads to big scary numbers. Which is a complete misunderstanding of how this all works. See the problem? For Jeanson, it’s either just selection, or just random chance. But in reality, it’s the two operating together. Random processes generate variation, selection acts on that variation. Neutral theory doesn’t say that natural selection doesn’t happen, just that it isn’t the *only* process driving evolutionary change. Surely Jeanson knows this, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

They also discuss abiogenesis quite a bit, but Jeanson seems to be under the impression that DNA, RNA, and protein would all appear in modern-looking cells at once, which…is not what anyone thinks happened. He also says that there would need to be RNA and proteins to replicate DNA, as though that would have been the original genomic medium, rather than RNA. 

In fact, several times he says specifically that you’d need proteins for this or that. The word “ribozyme” never comes up. It’s just that you need all of this stuff to randomly assemble. The best is when the other guys is like how could these molecules come together, “or even find themselves in a whole mass of other organic chemicals?” Uh, let’s see, they’re located in a big mass…of…**organic chemicals**. That’s how the **organic chemicals** come together. It’s at about 10 minutes, and I highly recommend watching that bit for the lols. 

Jeanson also mentions chirality, but apparently [hasn’t done his homework.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/65pp3u/how_did_homochirality_emerge_like_this/)

&amp;nbsp;

And of course it wouldn’t be a creationist propaganda film without paying homage to Michael Behe, the patron saint of selling out for the $$$, by mentioning irreducible complexity. Several times, Jeanson asserts that there are “systems that could not have evolved” due to irreducible complexity, but oddly, he never names any. But he does it with DNA, and he does it during a hilariously ignorant riff on dinosaurs and birds, which he prefaces with “I don’t know the biology necessarily of birds and dinosaurs in great detail,” which becomes clear instantly. 

Aside, this riff is why I think he’s lying through his teeth for the rest of it. When he’s bs’ing on birds and dinosaurs, he’s clearly on his back foot and out of his expertise. He’s just adlibbing. But for the rest of his inane claims, they’re well practiced, confident, and the delivery is smooth. Which means he knows the information, and he therefore knows he’s lying. 

But the takeaway is that there are several claims of IC, but no evidence of IC. As usual. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally. this whole exercise devolves several times into assertions that abiogenesis and evolution are impossible. It’s just WOAH COMPLICATED arguments from incredulity, which is really the central argument here. Which is to say, there isn’t really an argument here. It’s just vacuous assertions with no evidence behind them. And that’s exactly what I’ve come to expect from **Dr.** Nathaniel Jeanson: A well-credentialed liar. ",1507659560,20,2017-10-10 14:19:20

287,"Reasons for evolution, are they all valid?",0,True,"1. Micro evolution occurs, we observe this by looking at species adapting towards new environments

2. Species that get isolated, morph independently into adapted versions that don't mate with each other

3. We see a logical flow of species in our fossils, showing how species adapt step wise into new species

4. The species of 3 are also connected through A) similar DNA, B) ERV's (viruses on the same spots) and C) similar bone structures

5. Thus we can conclude that macro evolution really occurs.

Logic requires us to entail 5, IF 1,2,3,4 are all true statements.

Now I wonder the following about each individual statement:

1. I agree with this statement (Darwin’s birds, modern examples), but still have doubts about micro evolution adapting species so much, that they change into new species. 2,3,4 would entail this, but that’s why I’m having questions about these reasons:
2. This is true, but we only observed this to happen in pre-zygotic terms, meaning they changed mating preferences but are still biological capable of successful mating. Post-zygotic changes are said to be supported by statements 3 and 4.
3. I know about some evidence of step wise morphings of fossils such as Tiktaalik and the fish with the lungs, but I haven’t seen much more evidence for this yet. 
4. If all these 3 are true than this statement has a lot of weight, but they have to mean what they imply as well. That's why I have questions about these 3 sub statements:

A) Firstly I wonder, is the related DNA of assumed precursors in fact more similar to the assumed precursors than any other specie? And how does this proof more, than the fact that similarity in appearance is also observable as similarity in DNA? 

B) Secondly I wonder, are the found ERV’s only found in the species that are related to each other, or are they found in every specie in that specific environment? And the fact that the ERV's appear in the same spots as the assumed precursors, does that entail that they are related or could that also mean that species that are (just) similar to each other, could also handle ERV's in the same way?

C) I think this one is only valid when A) and B) are valid. It seems like similar bone structure couldn’t proof anything on it’s own, only that some of the found fossils look similar, which seems like begging the question if we call that proof for them to be related.  

I hope someone with a greater understanding in evolution than me can answer my questions :)

288,How to falsify evolution? (And is evolution truly empirical opposed to meta-physical),1,True,"**Background info:**

A theory is strong when there is found (&gt;X) verification.

All ravens are black is being verified by finding black ravens.
Now Karl Popper, criticized this scientific approach, simply because it's impossible to find all ravens and conclude every raven is black. That is why he suggested that in order to test a theory, one should look for examples that would proof the theory is wrong (in theory).
In this case any found non-black raven would falsify the theory. As long as there hasn't been found any falsification, one should hang on to the theory untill there has.

A good theory, is one that a lot of statements that can be verified, and also statements that can be falsified. 

Now we know the concept of God isn't scientific because it's A) meta physical and B) it's kind of impossible to scientifically verify or falsify the God premise, because it contains all causal relationships and is for that matter meta. Even IF God would exist, we couldn't prove God, since that would require us to be on a higher meta level compared to God (such as matter is to us), which the whole premise of God makes impossible (the concept entails that God made everything and is greater than us).

With this knowledge, I start to doubt about evolution as well since it is also the sum of all causal relationships of our universe in a some way meta (also because we extrapolate a lot about processes that are determined to have been going on for billions of years), but, luckily we can use empirical evidence to support it (right?)/ which makes it not meta-physical but an observable empirical phenomena. 

Now if that is the case (evolution = empirical), it should be possible to verify it's premises, but also falsify it's premises.

**The actual question**:

Considering the (mere) possibility of God existing, what could in theory falsify evolution? 

When taking evolution isolated from the possibility of a god God and looking at things purely empirical, what could in theory falsify evolution? And why could it falsify evolution? 

Bonus question: Is evolution, considering the amount of extrapolation that has to be done, truly empirical? Doesn't the POSSIBILITY of a God make the abduction towards evolution meta-physical as well?",1507375720,26,2017-10-07 07:28:40

/u/MRH2, who loves his flair of **M.Sc. physics, Mensa**, posted this thought:

&gt; I am just wondering about this. I thought about asking on /r/debateEvolution, but then realised that I'd just get tons of replies saying that ""abiogenesis is already proven"" despite there being no example in any lab or anywhere that can demonstrate, even just once, the origin of life from non-life.

Or, you'd get posts explaining why it's very possible, and the research and evidence we have that shows this?

&gt; People still seem to believe in abiogenesis so strongly that they are unable to contemplate any alternatives (well, except for maybe panspermia).

Or, creationists are so wound up in their belief that a creator has to exist, they can't ever think that life wasn't specially created, and is just the product of chemistry.

&gt; One would think that analysing various aspects of life and biochemistry would show that there are insurmountable gaps that cannot be crossed with incremental evolutionary changes. One such analysis by Dr. Paul Nelson is described below.

Except abiogenesis is not evolution, so why would life from non-life need to cross any ""incremental evolutionary changes""?

Then he continues to try to argue that the cell cannot exist without most of its components, therefore life had to be specially created.

The circlejerking safe-space is at warp speed.

294,The Geologic Column,5,True,"In this post:http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD101.html
Talk. Origins says:
""There are several places around the world where strata from all geological eras do exist at a single spot -- for example, the Bonaparte Basin of Australia (Trendall et al. 1990, 382, 396) and the Williston Basin of North Dakota (Morton 2001).""

Creation wiki responds to this by saying:

""Actually the use of the term ""era"" is somewhat deceptive since there are only three above the Precambrian. That means that only three fossils need to be used to make such a claim. They seem to have deliberately chosen the broadest category they could get away with, since each era above the Precambrian is divided into periods and some periods are divided into epochs. So having all three eras would have a fairly high statistical probability.
First of all, even having strata labeled as from all geological periods does not make the entire theoretical geologic column present. The entire geologic column would require layers of sediment about 100 miles thick and there is no place on Earth where this occurs. In fact this is more than twice the maximum thickness of the Earth crust.
Furthermore, none of these locations have all 34 types of index fossils and neither of the two locations above have all of the geological periods represented by index fossils. The rock layers have been given their respective labels on the basis of a comparison with rocks in other locations and the assumptions of uniformitarian geology.
Actually there is only one location in the world (southern Turkey) with all of the geological periods represented by index fossils, but even this location has only half of the 34 types of index fossils; as such it can be considered just a statistical occurrence.
The result is that the entire theoretical geologic column remains a purely theoretical construct, whose credibility depends on the assumptions of uniformitarian geology.""

&gt; Many of come here to avoid the drama-fest that takes place on other forums. I personally have no desire to have any debates on reddit about evolution. I would just like a place to touch base with the Creation community every now and then. I just don't simply have the time or effort to devote to the cause, nor do I share the enthusiasm others share.

There's constant drama on /r/creation. That's the problem with ideologies based on personal opinions and not on facts: people are wrong just because they don't believe just like you.

&gt; Well now it's open season on user's like me:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/73ojpk/another_disaster_in_the_making_rcreation_is_there/

&gt; Look at these baffoons!

Besides the numerous grammatical errors in those lines, he's whining that people dare to call him out on his post, *on another subreddit because hardly anyone here can post in reply there*.

What post was he called out for? This one:

&gt; &gt; if we grant the evolutionist a larger timeframe, do we have any response against them?

&gt; Haven't we done this many times already? When Darwin first touted this idea it was 100,000 years. Then they figured out that wasn't enough time for X, so it became 500,000 years. Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years. Now it's how many million?

&gt; The problem, to directly answer your question, is that when evolutionists request a longer timeframe to accommodate for Z, it creates a ripple in a lot of other dating methods that they've already been telling us proves their old time frame.

&gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

He's accusing scientists of inventing numbers, then trying to adjust data to fit those numbers. Then tries to say that if the world weren't old enough, they'd need to make the world older. Science follows the facts, and updates when it's wrong.

He continues:

&gt; As comical as it is that these goons can't rub two brain cells together to follow a conversation, it's actually a bit refreshing to hear an honest ad hominem attack against me.

&gt; Which brings me to the my second point. The shear amount of trolls in the subreddit. It's ridiculous. The politely worded ad hominem attacks are ridiculous. As a result this whole sub looks ridiculous.

An ad hominem attack is an attack against a person, not their argument. That would include calling people ""baffoons"" or trolls, or say that they can't rub two brain cells together to follow a conversation, instead of addressing their points.

&gt; In the thread in question. The OP asked a theoretical question about 'what if' evolutionists extended the time frame for evolution.

""What if"" questions are hypothetical questions, not theoretical ones. Theoretical ones are like the /r/creation OP asked, ""I've seen arguments that the timeframe is wrong and the mutation rate is too low, but if we grant the evolutionist a larger timeframe, do we have any response against them?""

The OP is asking whether creationists have a response to the mutation rate if time were no longer a factor.

4_jacks continues:

&gt; I answered the OP's question with If a biologist finds evidence that extends the time needed for evolution, then it creates problems for all the other disciplines that relate to that same time frame.

&gt; FOUR TROLLS in this forum jump on that with strawmen accusations of conspiracy theory nutbaggery. Not one, not two, but FOUR. That's a lot of trolls who can't even follow a basic conversation. One of them had the audacity to ask me site examples of a theorethical question!

The dishonesty train leaves the station!

/u/Taken-Away responded:

&gt; The biologists and the geologists are secretly plotting to create models that support the other's research? Do you have an example of them doing this in the past?

/u/ADualLuigiSimulator responded:

&gt; If I am understanding your comment correctly, you are implying that the age of the earth is essentially a partly made up age that biologists and geologists are secretly conspiring? Because that is how you are making this sound. ""Oh hey geologists, sorry we might have a problem with evolution over here, could you add another 500 million to the earth's age to solve this?""

. . .

&gt; &gt; When Darwin first touted this idea it was 100,000 years. Then they figured out that wasn't enough time for X, so it became 500,000 years. Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years.

&gt; Could you specifically tell me how you know that? Who did this? When? Where? Who changed these numbers and how was it accomplished? Conspiracy?

&gt; &gt; The problem, to directly answer your question, is that when evolutionists request a longer timeframe to accommodate for Z

&gt; Could you give me an example where ""evolutionists request a longer timeframe""?

&gt; &gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

&gt; You seem to have a pretty harsh opinion about biologists and geologists. They all seem to be diabolic masterminds who are only out to deceive the public with their ""made up"" numbers. Why and where does that opinion come from?

/u/matts2 responded:

&gt; &gt; Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years. Now it's how many million?

&gt; Who told you this nonsense? You are spreading falsehoods in the name of Christ. Consider what that means.

&gt; Anyway, physics tells us the Universe is about 14.5B years old.

&gt; &gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

&gt; Now you go from lies about the past to accusing others of dishonesty. And you do this in the name of Christ.

Finally, /u/4_jacks concludes:

&gt; It really cannot get any more ridiculous! I'm not even going to mention the nutter who was spouting off about sinning for Jesus.

&gt; Trolls are filling this sub reddit to maximum capacity with low quality strawmen and sparsely hidden ad hominem attacks.

&gt; ""Oh look 4_jacks noticed that geologist and biologist share the same evolutionary time frame, HE MUST BE A CRAZY CONSPIR_TARD""

&gt; Why is that pathetic strawman tolerated in this subreddit? Why is that thinly veiled ad hominem attack tolerated on this subreddit?

&gt; I know the moderators put in a lot of work. And it is a thankless task. It's a difficult situation and there are no easy answers. I apologize for the soapbox, but it's an honest attempt to vent frustration which hopefully will effect change. **The first being we should go back to being a private sub-reddit.**

He is really arguing that others are crafting straw men arguments against him, but you can plainly see he misrepresents the responses to him, and the post on /r/debateevolution, just to avoid defending his claims of conspiracy between biologists and geologists.

What he wants is to be able to say what he wants without anyone being able to criticize or scrutinize what he posts. His ideas cannot withstand the light of reason and logic.

That is why we cross-post sometimes from /r/creation, because the dishonesty, the illogical, the complete disregard for reason, keeps finding its way there, and few are able to respond to point out how it's wrong.

When your problem is that you'd rather be wrong if it meant no one could criticize you, reconsider why your subreddit even exists.

In my previous post I was pretty unclear about what I was asking so here it is reiterated:

According to this source: https://www.space.com/23694-moon-dust-mystery-apollo-data.html The moon gains 0.04 inches of dust every 1000 years. So based off this we could calculate:
4,470,000,000 / 1000= 4470000
4470000 * 0.04 = 178800 inches
= 14900 feet

-Define the distant light problem.

  If the earth is 6000 years old, how does light from distant stars beyond 6,000 light years get here. Evolutionists assume that with a 14 billion year old universe they have no problem here. But hold on, they have as much a problem as the creationist. The universe is said to be 156 billion light years from end to end.      If the earth was in the middle of that (which it isn’t) it would be 78 billion light years from each end.     So how de we see that if we have only only been around 14 billion years?   There is a second problem also, called the Horizon problem. The universe has been found to be uniform in temperature, but it is so big at 158 billion light years, that there hasn’t been enough time even at 14 Billion years for the temperature to exchange and even out cause that is light at the speed of light evening out.

  -What are some possible solutions?

  There are TWO solutions we don’t want to use.  

-People have said, the distances are not that big. They are that big, Our God is that big.  

-God created the light on its way. The problem is, we would be seeing this that weren’t really there, and thus God would be lying to use.  

Solutions we do use.  

1) CDK. The speed of light was faster at creation. The problem with this is that the speed of light is linked to nature with the famous equation c=mc^2. If you speed up light, matter also becomes massive. If you increase the speed of light, the amount of energy increases exponentially. This change in energy can be trouble. They are still working on this.  

2) GTD Gravitational time dilation. Time flows at different rates. Perhaps the universe has aged millions of years, while the earth has aged millions of years. General relativity shows clocks move more slowly when in a gravitational- well. If the earth is near the center of the universe time would flow more slowly here. The question is, is the well deep enough, and the details are still being worked out.  

3) The alternate synchrony convention. This one has to do with time zones. Is it a matter of if we are in different time zones.   

4) The supernatural solution. God sped up the universe during creation week and slowed time down on earth during the same week.

314,Archaeological evidence ignored and academic dishonesty,0,True,"The [Hueyatlaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco) site is an archaeological site in Mexico which contains archaeological activity dated to 250,000 ybp. 

Because I except most of you to be lazy to read the article, I will post relevant excerpts here. 

&gt;Excavations were conducted via standard protocols, including securing the sites to prevent trespass or accidental disturbances

and:

&gt;During excavation, investigators discovered numerous stone tools. The tools ranged from relatively primitive implements at a smaller associated site, to more sophisticated items such as scrapers and double-edged blades uncovered at the main excavation site. The diversity of tools made from non-local materials suggested that the region had been used by multiple groups over a considerable period.

Now, immediately after these finds and the dating, this is what one member said:

&gt;In 1967, Jose L. Lorenzo of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia claimed that implements had been planted at the site by local laborers in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible to determine which artifacts were discovered in situ and which were planted.

See the double standards employed here?  This argument is typical of Darwinists, and is invoked whenever evidence that contradicts the evolutionary historical narrative is found. Michael Cremo of *Forbidden Archeology* points out several such incidents over the last 200 years. 

Then,

&gt;Irwin-Williams counter-argued that **Lorenzo's claims were malicious and without merit.** Furthermore, in 1969 Irwin-Williams[4] cited statements of support from three prominent archeologists and anthropologists (Richard MacNeish, Hannah Marie Wormington and Frederick A. Peterson) who had each visited the site independently and attested to the integrity of the excavations and the professionalism of the group's methodology.

So now we see academic dishonesty and attempted cover up. 

It gets more interesting: 

&gt;Radiocarbon dating of the animal remains produced an age of over 35,000 ybp. Uranium dating produced an age of 260,000 ybp, ± 60,000 years.
**The authors stated that they had no definitive explanation for the anomalous results.** However, Malde suggested the tool-bearing strata had possibly been eroded by an ancient streambed, thus combining older and newer strata and **complicating dating.**

We see this response everywhere for other ""anomalous findings"". Scientists tend to simply *explain away* things that contradict established theories. This is another case of double standards too,  because they never invoke the ""measurement contamination"" to explain away findings consistent with theories. Plus there is actually no proof of data contamination. 

Later on:

&gt;They were able to rule out Malde's streambed hypothesis.

Also, 

&gt;Irwin-Williams asserted that Hueyatlaco had not been accurately **dated to her satisfaction.**

Which means a more recent date.

&gt;Malde and Steen-McIntyre argued that the 200,000 ybp findings were valid, while Irwin-Williams argued in favor of a more recent -- though still somewhat controversial -- figure of 20,000 ybp. Webb and Clark[6]suggest that **her promoting the 20,000ybp date is ""particularly puzzling,"" as it was unsupported by any evidence the team uncovered.**

More academic dishonesty and fraud. 

Several papers were indeed published on this finding, such as this:

&gt;The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an **archeological dilemma** [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which **serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.**

So that's it, forget about it and move on. Most people haven't even heard of this finding and they don't even mention it in school. They still teach that humans haven't entered Americas no earlier than 25k ybp.

Imagine how many ""anomalous finds"" were ignored. But it turns out, anomalous finds over time no longer become anomalous, they become regular evidence.",1506523361,17,2017-09-27 10:42:41
315,"The ""Evidence for Creation"" according to my creationist teacher.",13,True,"Here is a list of some ""evidences for creation"" that my teacher has been spouting off in class. I'm not gonna include all of them, cause many I can easily debunk myself. However, there are a few outside my area of expertise. So here are the arguments (responses that I could take to class would be great):

(Taken from my notes. Most, if not all, are his exact words)

-If language evolved, the earliest languages should be the simplest. On the contrary, it appear that acient languages were more complex with respect to syntax, cases, genders, tenses, verb forms, etc. The evidence shows that language devolves

-The studies of documented children who were raised without contact with other humans. Ferol children show that human speech appears to be learned from other humans. humans apparenly have no inborn ability to speak. So how did the first humans learn how to speak?

-If the earth in its alleged origin had oxygen in its atmosphere, the chemicals needed for life would hald been removed by oxidation. But if their had been no oxygen then there would have neen no ozone, ALl life would quickly be destroyed.

-DNA can only be reproduced with the help of certain enzymes, but the enzymes act at the direction of DNA. SInce each requires the other, evolutionists don't have a satisfactory explanation for either origin.

-Amino acids when found in nonliving matter come in two forms, they call them left handed and right handed, but they are chemically equivalent with two possibilities, half of the matter is right handed, the other left handed. When we go to the protein molecules found in all forms of life, there amino acids are only of the left handed variety. The mathematical probability that this is by chance is virtually zero.

-There are many instances where quite different forms of life are completely dependent on each other. Example: Fig trees and fig gall wasps, etc. Did these evolve at the same time? In many examples such as the one listed above, they would have had to evolve at exactly the same time.

-According to all theroms of the evolution of the solar system:

The planets should all rotate on their axis in the same direction. However, Venus and Uranus rotate backwards.

-All the moons of the various planets should revolve in the same direction at least 11 revolve backwards.

-The orbits of these moons should all be in the equitorial plane of the planet they oribit. Many, including the earth's, are highly inclinded.

316,Human evolution does not require we evolve from apes while on Earth,0,True,"The theory of evolution sufficiently explains the biological and genetic changes between one generation and the next, and how beneficial mutations can help a species survive. 

It does not explain abiogenesis, because it's beyond its scope, and more importantly, does not explain the history of species change on Earth. Simply put, evolutionary theory is the biological and genetic explanation for how species change over time; mutations and adaptations, and not the ""what happened and what changed"". 

In order to know the ""what happened"", we must turn to the fossil record, because that is stronger evidence than making inferences from genes. What this means is that humans could have lived since the beginning Earth was formed with very little change. There is no ""requirement"" in evolutionary theory that we be descendants of apes while on earth. You may then ask, how do we share so much DNA with them? We reply, because the designer used the genome of the ape, made some modifications before creation to make it human, and placed both species on Earth at the same time. In other words, we share DNA with apes because we look like them. 

Then you will ask, where is the fossil evidence? Michael Cremo has published a  book called *Forbidden Archaeology* that illustrates numerous finds of the last 200 years showing hominid activity dating to 2 billion years ago. Unfortunately, this evidence was dismissed because it ""didn't fit he model"". Cremo also shows that bureacracy was more important than fossil finds. 

His finds show that there is no contradiction between ancient human antiquity and the theory of evolution.

Evolution is simply the genetic explanation for how species change. There is no requirement in the theory that mutations have to occur in a specific way, or at all. A shark can remain a shark unchanged for billions of years, if no mutations occurred in its species. Mutations do not have to occur.",1506441305,164,2017-09-26 11:55:05

320,Somebody Wrangle These Goalposts!,11,True,"I just want to take a moment highlight what is possibly the most hilarious and egregious goalpost-moving I have ever encountered. Gymnastics like this are the reason that we can never ""win"" this debate; we just have to keep playing whack-a-mole as we find awesome new things and pushing the limits of our knowledge and understanding of evolutionary change. And when we do that, creationists will pull these kinds of shenanigans, because it's all they can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

So here's the setup: A thread titled [""If microorganisms and cells are subject to evolution why isn't all life?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/701pvm/if_microorganisms_and_cells_are_subject_to/) Good f'in question, u/eintown. The answers are your typical micro/macro stuff, but buried a bit is this one comment I'd like to highlight, from u/honestcreationist:

&gt;Speciation has been observed in microbes and in more complex forms of life. However, species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

Okay, we have a concrete standard here, or at least concrete-ish, considering that the degrees of difference between these taxonomic levels is a bit subjective. But it's more specific than we usually get. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I highlighted this comment, among others, [in this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqm0e/?context=10000) and provided *Paulinella chromatophora*, an amoeboid rhizarian that has acquired a primary plastid, as an example of an organism that has undergone change of the magnitude we usually see separating members of different kingdoms. In this example, it's going from a heterotroph to an autotroph. A big change. 

&amp;nbsp;

But apparently not good enough.

First, it isn't a ""new"" kingdom:

&gt;I specifically said ""new"" kingdom, but he tried to use an example of a kingdom transfer.

Then it's ""well it's not *technically* a new kingdom"":

&gt;As far as I can tell, Paulinella chromatophora is still considered a rhizarian, not an alga. Do you have a source that calls it an alga or places it in Viridiplantae?

Well duh, phylogenetically it's a rhizarian. That's. The. Point. Something that *isn't* closely related to green algae acquired the traits of green algae, in this case via endosymbiosis and horizontal gene transfer. Differences so large we normally see them in organisms of different kingdoms. 

&amp;nbsp;

But wait! It's time to move those goal posts again. Now the problem is that we're still dealing with microbes:

&gt;the original post in /r/Creation was asking about scaling evolutionary processes from microbial life to macroscopic life. Horizontal gene transfer does not scale to macroscopic life

But even this new objection isn't valid. We see the *exact same processes* going on in animals. [*Elysia chlorotica*,](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/46/17867.short) for example. 

Think that settled it? Of course not! What do you think this is, some kind of rational discussion? Here's the next objection:

&gt;Horizontal gene transfer is not the primary mechanism of evolution in multicellular organisms, even if it does happen.

So never mind that we're observing it happen and causing a giant change (photosynthetic animals!), it's not the *primary* mechanism, so it doesn't count. 

&amp;nbsp;

But we're almost there. [I pointed out this bait-and-switch,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dn3e3md/) and this was the response:

&gt;But while HGT can increase diversity for a particular species, it doesn't increase the overall biodiversity, as the same genes are being shifted around. So evolution by HGT cannot account for the whole of modern biodiversity.

See the new problem? Now it's not that HGT can't or doesn't happen. It's that it can't explain *everything*. Never mind that there are, you know, other evolutionary mechanisms also operating. It's apparently all on HGT, and since HGT can't explain *everything*, that's it, evolution isn't possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is pointless right? Well let me give you one more. [I asked straight up:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqbee/)

&gt;So I'm going to ask again, since an animal becoming photosynthetic apparently isn't significant enough to make you think twice, what would be enough?

The answer? Oh, this answer. I want to print this out and frame it as a tribute to cognitive dissonance. [What would make u/honestcreationist think maybe evolution can explain major changes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqf7h/)

&gt;An animal becoming photosynthetic via vertical processes.

&lt;italian chef kissing fingers&gt; Perfect. The thing that would do it is the *exact thing we're observing*, but through a *different mechanism*. A-maze-ing. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that concludes, for now, the saga of the moving goalposts, in which we started with 
&gt;However, species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

and took a journey through time and evolutionary change, eventually finding our way to

1) The human brain resembles a disorganized heap of disjointed systems which loosely interact with each other. Many aspects of the brain are subconscious. For example, sexual arousal and erections are subconscious. Mood is also subconscious--a person doesn't choose to be depressed, for example. Pain and hunger are also subconscious.

I know very little about the big bang, but I'm sure you guys will know how to respond.

Here are my notes: (exact words from my teacher)

Astronomy.

-Astronomy is a hot bed of evolution.

-The dominant theme today is the Big Bang theory.

-The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos and immense explosion of mass-energy about 14 billion years ago. Ever since, matter has been expanding outward. Stars, galaxies, planets, and people graduallly formed from these fragments.

-Evolutionists must tread lightly over problems like:

*Where did the intial mass energy come from?

*What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

Ignoring these problems, what evidence is promoted for the Big Bang?

-The measured redshift in the light radiated from different stars. Light from most stars is found to be reder (longer wave length) thus moving away. Thus the universe is expanding. But, hubble was causing trouble, further out, younger galaxies all over, are mixed with older galaxies. Also, light can be redened by gravity. (Einstein predicted this in 1912. Gravity can bend light.) As light moves away from a star its energy is lessened and thus its frequency is shifted. But this is ruled out because of asymmetry. The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

-Another problem hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

&gt;I imagine there would be quite a bit of genetics research, including studying pseudogenes, comparing ""gene trees"" to the standard evolutionary tree, and the specific effects of evolution on the genome.

&gt; As an extension of the genetics research, baraminology would practically become its own field as they endeavor to define the originally created kinds.

&gt; Lastly, there would be intense scrutiny of radiometric dating techniques. These procedures are quite expensive, so it is hard for creationists to study them in-depth without significant funding. Usually they have to go through third-party dating labs, which are not always cooperative.

&gt; Would evolution (that is, Universal Common Ancestry) still be the dominating theory? I doubt it. Creationism (if not the modern form) was the dominant theory when the Church had most of the power and money, for better or worse.

The creationists over there seem to think that the best way to do creationist research is to take existing research, and try to find out how it applies to creationism and/or disproves evolution.

I can give you an example of just about any kind of evolutionary change you might ask for, but I can't find a single creationist willing to say what specifically counts as ""macroevolution"" (which, again, is different from quote-less macroevolution).

Does any of this macroevolution count as ""macroevolution""? I bet not. And I also bet that nobody can give a clear reason why, or a clear standard for what *would* count as ""macroevolution"". Because the only definition I've been able to work out for ""macroevolution"" is ""evolutionary changes we haven't seen yet,"" and that's a moving target. Every time we find a new thing happening, it no longer counts! Neat trick, right?

339,Various False Creationist Claims,18,True,"In [this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/701pvm/if_microorganisms_and_cells_are_subject_to/) there are a whole bunch of not-true statements made. (Also, to the OP: good f'ing question.) I want to highlight a few of the most egregious ones, in case anyone happens to be able to post over there, or wants some ammunition for future debates on the issue.

So without further ado:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Cells becoming resistant to drugs is actually a loss of information. The weak cells die. The strong live. But nothing changed. Nothing altered. It just lost information.

Can be, but mostly this is wrong. Most forms of resistance involve an additional mechanism. For example, a common form of penicillin resistance is the use of an efflux pump, a protein pump that moves the drug out of the cell. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

Two very clear counterexamples: *P. chromatophora*, a unique and relatively new type of green algae, is descended from heterotrophic amoeboid protozoans through the acquisition of a primary plastid. So amoeba --&gt; algae. That would generally be considered different kingdoms. 

Another one, and possible my favorite, is that time a plasmid turned into a virus. A plasmid acquired the gene for a capsid protein from a group of viruses, and this acquisition resulted in a completely new group of viruses, the geminviruses. 

It's worth noting that the processes working here are just selection operating on recombination, gene flow (via horizontal gene transfer), and mutation. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Creationists don't believe that they [microevolution and macroevolution] are different scales of the same thing.

Creationists are wrong. See my last sentence above. Those are ""macro"" changes via ""micro"" processes.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;we have experiments to see if these small changes would have any greater effect in bacteria that rapidly reproduce at an extraordinary rate, they keep trying, but they have yet to get a different kind of bacteria or anything noteworthy enough to make any claim of evolutionary evidence.

Except, for example, a novel metabolic pathway (aerobic citrate metabolism) in *E. coli*. Or, not in the lab, but observed in the 20th century, mutations in specific SIV proteins that allowed that virus to infect humans, becomes HIV. I think that's noteworthy.

341,"Aren't some modern species essentially a paradox for creationism understanding of ""kind""?",3,True,"Let's take the horse and the zebra. Are they the same species or not? For evolutionary world view the answer is simple, they are closely related, but not the same species. Meaning we can just apply the tree of life here, that all species have common ancestors at some point in history. 

However in creationism world, there is no such thing as 'closely related', because every animal belongs to a hardcoded group, called 'kind' and they don't have any common ancestors to each other, because they were created separately.

On the one hand, they can breed with each other, which means **they are so similar to each other, that their DNA almost matches and they must be considered related.** 

On the other hand, they can't really produce a fertile offspring, meaning they can't be the same species, as Creationsts have always argued that no matter how much mutations are applied to a species, it still remains the same species. **Thus the horse and the zebra can't origin from the same ancestry**, otherwise they could produce a fertile offspring by creationist expectations.

Paradox happens when a creationist is trying to answer whether they are the same species or not. Both answers produce a new question that can't be answered from non-evolution point of view. If yes, then why can't they produce a fertile offspring? If no, then why can they mate at all? It's too common in nature that some species are so similar to be a part of a grand design, there's no reason why there would be so many different species who can mate with each other without evolution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_hybrids 

Furthermore, isn't the horse and the zebra, or lion and tiger, actually a live proof of speciation, since they are on the verge of becoming a completely different species, but have not changed enough to be completely infertile toward each other DNA? So they are essentially a visible example of how transitional species emerge. Technically every species is transitional towards something else, if viewed in certain timeline, but such parallel evolution of those pairs that can breed unsuccessfully describes better how it actually happens in my opinion.",1505370155,10,2017-09-14 02:22:35

344,Evolution's hypothesis and null hypothesis,0,True,"For a theory to be scientific, it must possess two opposing criteria: a hypothesis and a null hypothesis. A valid formulation for a theory must set forth a test that, when passed, demonstrates that the theory shows that something is true. This is the hypothesis. Likewise, a valid formulation for a theory must set forth a test that, if passed, demonstrates that the same something is false. This is the null hypothesis.

####Neo-Darwinian Evolution
 
The null test hypothesis for Darwin's theory was offered by Darwin himself in his Origins monograph, when he famously said:

&gt; ""If it can be demonstrated that a complex organ exists which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.""

Now it must be asked, is this test too strict? After all, how does one demonstrate that such a genetic pathway cannot possibly exist? And the mere inability to demonstrate impossibility does not demonstrate necessity. Nevertheless, there is no universal standard of strictness for null hypotheses, and I would be willing to accept this as a valid null hypothesis, as long as the validation test is correspondingly strict. Let me suggest such a test, updated to the current neo-Darwinian Synthesis:

&gt; ""If it can be demonstrated that a complex organ was in fact formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis will have been confirmed.""

Of course, for theories like gravitation, such confirming tests are performed repeatedly and routinely. The theory is tested at high and low temperatures, for large bodies and small, and in the presence and absence of a never-ending list of special conditions. But for the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis, no such thing has ever been demonstrated. To do so, one would have to lay out a series of slight (slight enough to be the result of random mutations) modifications (actual, or at least theoretical) and show that the resulting phenotype could successfully compete in its environment and gain dominance, so as to enable it to found the next evolutionary stage. Not only has this never been demonstrated for a complex organ (such as the eye or brain), it has not been demonstrated for a simple organ (hair follicle or eyelid), nor for a system (lymph or endocrine), tissue (smooth muscle or vein), cell (blood or neuron) or organelle (ribosome or Golgi apparatus).

In fact, no genetic pathway has *ever* been documented in this manner. Certainly, individual mutations have been documented which resulted in the generation of distinguishable, even useful phenotypes, such as the nylon-eating bacterium. But even these have been shown to not increase the information content in the cell, and in the case of this bacterium the cell appears to have a mechanism already in place involving highly mutation-sensitive plasmids to facilitate this very type of mutation, similar to the amazing ability of antibodies to form random antigen bonding sites via hyper-mutation, even to synthesized allergens that have never before existed in nature.

Isn't it a bit premature to declare that ""evolution is a fact, not a theory"", as Carl Sagan did in his book ""Cosmos"" (p.27)? Evolution claims to be the sole mechanism responsible for the generation of every living organism from a single common ancestor — a bold assertion indeed.

The assumptions are:

1) Spontaneous generation non living things to living

My Teacher went on to say, ""Spontaneous genration was hotly debated in medieval universities. Medieval man saw things like dead animals sprouting maggots, dead trees sprouting mushrooms. But they also knew from the bible that life came from life. There was debate. Finally however an iltaian Francesco Redi did a series of experiments that once and for all disporved spontaneous generation. He published his finding in the year 1668. His experiments ended the debate. However, 200 years later with Darwin and his theory, spontaneous generation must be ressurected."" Thats an exact quote btw.

2) This occured only once

3) All bacteria, plants and animals are interrelated.

4) One celled animals gave rise to multicelled animals.

5) Invertebrates are interrelated.

6) Invertebrates gave rise to vertebrates.

###The RNA world hypothesis: the worst theory of the early evolution of life (except for all the others)

Since this article is laboring under the BDMNP, the ""others"" here are ""other naturalistic hypotheses"". This article is confessing that all naturalistic hypotheses are ""the worst"", but the RNA world hypothesis is the ""least worst"" of all of them.

The BDMNP is *not* an assertion that is determined scientifically. It can't be, since science (commonly-accepted science, that is — not my science) presupposes the BDMNP! All science assumes, ostensibly for methodological purposes only, that naturalism is true. But what sense does it make to presuppose naturalism without believing it is true? Naturalism excludes possible causal explanations for natural phenomena that may, in fact, include the *true* explanation.

If you think that one can apply the BDMNP without being a doctrinaire naturalist, just try performing this thought experiment: assume for a moment that life indeed was supernaturally initiated (you can only do this by stepping out of your naturalist milieu if you are a naturalist). Now, try to explain the origin of life, while laboring under the BDMNP. You will have to accept the least-absurd naturalistic explanation of all possible naturalistic explanations (which is false, by the way), no matter how absolutely absurd the entire set of naturalistic explanations might be.

349,Creationists: What practical applications could we get from your world view if it turned out to be true.,16,True,"In evolution, all life on Earth is derived from a common ancestor and which means they all share at least some DNA. When examining the DNA of a human and another animal, we find that the farther away the branch of between our common ancestors were (or in other words, the less human-like the creature is) the less DNA we share. 

Because of this, we can know what animals are better fit for testing and what we should or shouldn't test on them. If there's a gene therapy that's supposed to handle a certain few base pairs in the genome, it would be pointless to test it on something that doesn't share that DNA with us. 

That's one of several examples of our knowledge of evolution being used in a practical application. It's not just something read in a textbook but something applied to medical science.

So what aspects of creationism would have an application outside of reading about it in Genesis. How would knowledge of God making everything within a week help us in any way?

Talk.Origins' excuses do not change the fact that there are no fossils between single cell life and complex multi-cellular life.
The claim that early multi-cellular life was too small to be found and too soft to fossilize is bogus since fossil bacteria have been found in Precambrian rock despite being soft and smaller.
The claim that molecular evidence shows some animal phyla to be Precambrian assumes evolution and as such it can't be used as evidence that it has occurred. It is still a fact that there are no fossils between single cell life and complex multi-cellular life.""

He said that for the first 6 weeks we will be discussing the beginning of history, 6,000 years ago, with creation. He said as we discuss it, it will seem more like a ""science class"" then a ""history"" class. This is a sure sign that we will be discussing the creation/evolution debate for 6 weeks. He explained that we will not be using our textbooks until week 7, so I have no way to evalute his creationist claims ahead of time. I checked the book, there is only one small paragraph about evolution in it (I will type that paragraph in another post). So 6 weeks of creationist claims, with no citations, and no way to find where the claims originated from. I can only sit, listen, and try to write down every claim he makes for class notes and for you guys to read. The best part about this is that after every single class, my smug creationist classmates will leave the classroom taunting me about how he ""destroyed evolution"" without me getting a chance to respond to the claims. I am not just guessing what they will do I know because all past experiences have led me to believe this. When we discussed evolution for 1 and a half weeks in biology the kids would say how evolution is so stupid and mock me. So I will get to hear this everyday for about 6 weeks.

359,Why I no longer believe in evolution,0,True,"So I'm a pre-med college student. Until recently I believed in evolution. However, the more I study higher level Biology, the more I doubt the plausibility of evolution. According to the current theory, life began on Earth approximately 3.5 billion years ago. The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago. 4.6-3.5=1.1 Billion years that it took for life to form. However, according to the [Miller Experiment,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) the probability of creating a primitive cell from random electrical shocks of a biological soup is 1 x 10^-40,000. In other worlds, not even in 1,000 Trillion years would life randomly arise, never-mind in a mere 1.1 Billion years. This is because even if an electrical shock produces a complex amino acid (which is still far, far from a primitive cell) the probability of that complex amino acid being destroyed by a subsequent shock or other factors is extremely high. The probability of many complex amino acids reaching critical mass and somehow arranging themselves into functioning DNA is for all intents and purposes impossible. This in and of itself should be enough evidence that evolution without divine intervention is lunacy.


Now going on to the point that God could have created the first primitive cell and then allowed it to evolve. Again there is the problem that such a cell would very likely be destroyed by the environment or die out. Even if it managed to survive, the chance of random mutations leading to more complex organisms is preposterous. This is because when small mutations occur, they are just that, small mutations. It takes many small mutations in order to create a new species. Most small mutations do not have enough of an advantage to the overall fitness of the species to warrant natural selection. Furthermore, many features that we see today do not provide enough of an advantage to warrant their prevalence in a species. Now it is true that many traits are the byproduct of natural selection for other traits, since genes can often be linked. It is also possible that genetic drift causes a random population to be isolated, which may increase the prevalence of certain traits. However, there are so many unnecessary traits in so many species, that is cannot be attributed to mere genetic byproducts or genetic drift. For example, do human beings really need so many different eye colors and hair colors? Do butterflies really need to have such intricate patterns? Is it really necessary for people to have such complicated eyes? Do peacocks really need such elaborate feathers? Do Elephants really have to have such large tusks? While all these features are nice, they don't really have *that* huge of an effect on reproductive success. 

Finally, even if a trait does have a clear advantage, it is likely to be lost in the general gene pool. If 1 person has a mutation for blonde hair, that mutation will be lost to the tens of thousands of people who do not have this trait. A mutation has to occur simultaneously in numerous individuals in close proximity to one other, who then go on to successfully mate with each other in order for the trait to not be washed away in the general population.

In short, the likelihood of all of these things happening within a timespan of only a few billion years is approximately zero. As such I no longer believe in the theory evolution. ",1504820765,70,2017-09-07 17:46:05

Creationist Claim: Fossils of marine organisms have been found on mountains. This is evidence that the whole world was once under water, even covering the tops of mountains. Clearly another piece of evidence for Noah's flood.

The fossils were formed before the mountains formed. Before the formation of the mountain, the area, at some point in earth’s history, was a part of the sea. Since this area had marine organisms swimming in it, marine fossils formed. Mountains are formed when two Tecontic plates collide together and causes the earth’s crust to be deformed and land masses are uplifted which form mountains. (Chepkemoi, 2017) When this land is uplifted the marine fossils are taken along with. This is why we see marine fossils on mountains. (BROWNE, 1987) There is no necessary reason to attribute theses fossils to a world wide flood. They can easily be expalined by the formation of mountains.

368,"From /r/creation: ""Evolutionary Theorist Concedes: Evolution 'Largely Avoids' Biggest Questions of Biological Origins""",14,True,"From this recent post on /r/creation:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6xj0wd/evolutionary_theorist_concedes_evolution_largely/

The link goes to a blog post on Discovery Institute's ""Evolution News and Views"" creationist site. The post uses Gerd Mueller's talk at the Royal Society meeting, ""New Trends in Evolutionary Biology.""

[What he discusses in his talk](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royfocus/7/5/20170015.full.pdf) is how evolution has advanced considerably since the evolutionary synthesis melded together several sciences into one.

&gt; The material basis of inheritance has been unravelled and entire new fields of research have arisen, such as molecular genetics, evolutionary developmental biology and systems biology. In addition, new evolutionarily relevant factors have been described, including non-genetic inheritance, developmental bias, niche construction, genomic evolution and others. Clearly, our understanding of evolution has significantly expanded, and it would be surprising if these empirical and conceptual advances had no theoretical consequences, so that in the midst of a substantial growth of knowledge, the central theory uniting the different fields of biology remained unaltered.

Unfortunately, like with everything dealing with creationists, they skip this part, and go ahead and misrepresent what it is Mueller is arguing.

Part of the criticism:

&gt; Uh, whoa. Or as our friend says, “BOOM.” Read that again. Müller says that “current evolutionary theory…largely avoids the question of how the complex organizations of organismal structure, physiology, development or behavior…actually arise in evolution.” But how stuff “actually arises” is precisely what most people think of when they think of “evolution.”­­­

Could it be that most people think that way due to creationist lies about what evolution is? The theory of evolution as it exists today, and as Mueller painfully illustrates in his talk, wonderfully explains the observations we have with the life on Earth we have today. What it doesn't do is incorporate other hypotheses and theories slightly related to the diversity of life yet.

What Mueller is not doing is saying that evolution fails, or that scientists don't want to bother with these topics. What he's doing is arguing that, long ago we incorporated many sciences into one larger theory, and perhaps it is best that we consider doing this again, *due to the enormous and fruitful work scientists are doing in those fields*.

&gt; Even though claims have been made that classical evolutionary
biology has continuously incorporated aspects from new conceptual domains, the majority of tenets and explanations that appear in characterizations of the current theory are still derived from the MS account and its population genetic principles. In a condensed form, these tenets are as follows: (i) all evolutionary explanation requires the study of populations of organisms; (ii) populations contain genetic variation that arises randomly from mutation and recombination; (iii) populations evolve by changes in gene frequency brought about by natural selection, gene flow and drift; (iv) genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects and the resulting phenotypic variation is gradual and continuous; (v) genetic inheritance alone accounts for the transmission of selectable variation; (vi) new species arise by a prevention of gene flow between populations that evolve differently; (vii) the phenotypic differences that distinguish higher taxa result from the incremental accumulation of genetic variation; (viii) natural selection represents the only directional factor in evolution.

ENV continues its misreprentation with this:

&gt; “Challenges to the classical model” are “widespread” and “none…are unscientific.” Wow — file that one away for future reference.

Except what they're quoting is this, from Mueller:

&gt; The theory of evolution is the fundamental conceptual framework of biology all scientific explanations of living phenomena must be consistent with. As it does not describe a universal law regarding a single natural phenomenon, such as gravity, but rather the principles of organismal change over time, based on the highly complex inputs and interactions of a multiplicity of different factors, evolutionary theory cannot be expected to remain static but is subject to change in the light of new empirical evidence. This is a normal process of scientific advancement and not a heretical undertaking as it is sometimes perceived to be. Explanations of organismal diversity have changed significantly during pre- and post-Darwinian periods, and it should not come as a surprise that fresh stimuli arise from the new methodologies and the expanded scope of modern biological research. Indeed, a growing number of challenges to the classical model of evolution have emerged over the past few years, such as from evolutionary developmental biology, epigenetics, physiology, genomics, ecology, plasticity research, population genetics, regulatory evolution, network approaches, novelty research, behavioural biology, microbiology and systems biology, further supported by arguments from the cultural and social sciences, as well as by philosophical treatments. None of these contentions are unscientific, all rest firmly on evolutionary principles and all are backed by substantial empirical evidence.

What Mueller does point out is that change is sometimes not receptive with biologists:

&gt; Sometimes these challenges are met with dogmatic hostility, decrying any criticism of the traditional theoretical edifice as fatuous, but more often the defenders of the traditional conception argue that ‘all is well’ with current evolutionary theory, which they see as having ‘co-evolved’ together with the methodological and empirical advances that already receive their due in current evolutionary biology. But the repeatedly emphasized fact that innovative evolutionary mechanisms have been mentioned in certain earlier or more recent writings does not mean that the formal structure of evolutionary theory has been adjusted to them. To the contrary, the discrepancies between the current usage of evolutionary concepts and the predictions derived from the classical model have grown.

Mueller is not making an argument, as ENV wants its readers to think, that scientists don't want to explore things like the origins of life or how evolution started because they're going to lead to uncomfortable answers, but because many scientists are against expanding the theory of evolution again to include these questions and answers. And those answers aren't uncomfortable; they're just not for questions asked in the current theory.

We come upon a flat-out lie from ENV:

&gt; Here he obliterates the notion, a truly fatuous extrapolation, that microevolutionary changes can explain macroevolutionary trends

While quoting Mueller (emphasis theirs):

&gt; A subtler version of the this-has-been-said-before argument used to deflect any challenges to the received view is to pull the issue into the never ending micro-versus-macroevolution debate. Whereas ‘microevolution’ is regarded as the continuous change of allele frequencies within a species or population [109], the ill-defined macroevolution concept [36], amalgamates the issue of speciation and the origin of ‘higher taxa’ with so-called ‘major phenotypic change’ or new constructional types. Usually, a cursory acknowledgement of the problem of the origin of phenotypic characters quickly becomes a discussion of population genetic arguments about speciation, often linked to the maligned punctuated equilibria concept [9], in order to finally dismiss any necessity for theory change. The problem of phenotypic complexity thus becomes (in)elegantly bypassed. Inevitably, the conclusion is reached that microevolutionary mechanisms are consistent with macroevolutionary phenomena [36], even though this has very little to do with the structure and predictions of the EES. **The real issue is that genetic evolution alone has been found insufficient for an adequate causal explanation of all forms of phenotypic complexity, not only of something vaguely termed ‘macroevolution’. Hence, the micro–macro distinction only serves to obscure the important issues that emerge from the current challenges to the standard theory.** It should not be used in discussion of the EES, which rarely makes any allusions to macroevolution, although it is sometimes forced to do so.

What Mueller's doing here is explaining the topic of an ""extended evolutionary synthesis,"" or EES:

&gt; The EES was proposed as a theoretical framework that takes account of the plurality of factors and causal relations in evolutionary processes. It continues to see variation, differential reproduction, heredity, natural selection, drift, etc., as necessary components of evolution, but it differs in how these factors are conceptualized. In addition, in the EES, development assumes a constructive role, natural selection is not the only way that variation in populations can be modified, causation does not run solely in one direction from the external environment to populations and, instead of a single inheritance mechanism, several modes of transmission exist between generations.

Mueller is explaining what problems arise with the EES being formulated over the modern evolutionary synthesis:

&gt; The EES is not a simple, unfounded call for a new theory but has become an ongoing project for integrating the theoretically relevant concepts that have arisen from multiple fields of evolutionary biology. Although the EES recognizes the fundaments of the classical MS theory, it differs in its interpretation of the role of some of its elements and integrates new components, such as constructive processes of development, multiple inheritance mechanisms, niche reciprocity, as well as behavioural and cultural elements (on which this overview did not dwell much, but see other contributions to this issue). It is unavoidable to notice that an integration of these concepts means not a simple add-on of a few peripheral notions to the MS model without any effects on its core logic.

The citation in that paragraph regarding microevolutionary mechanisms is for Douglas Futuyma's paper, ""Can Modern Evolutionary Theory Explain
Macroevolution?,"" which notes:

&gt; Early steps toward our growing understanding of developmental mechanisms, especially the models of gene regulation by Jacob and Monod (1961) and Britten and Davidson (1971), informed King and Wilson’s (1975) interpretation of molecular differences between chimpanzee and human, and were featured in chapters on macroevolution in the textbooks by Dobzhansky et al. (1977) and Futuyma (1979). Since then, evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) has become (in my opinion) one of the most exciting dimensions of evolutionary biology. Mechanistic understanding of gene action, of regulatory circuits, of the conservation of elements in the “genetic toolkit,” and their association with different downstream genes are rapidly deepening our understanding of evolutionary changes in form (Carroll et al. 2005; Kirschner and Gerhart 2005; Stern 2011; Davidson 2011).

What Futuyma and Mueller both are arguing in their respective papers is that the modern evolutionary synthesis did not include the developmental mechanisms of evolutionary changes when it was originally proposed, and little work since has been made to incorporate these into the theory itself. Neither of these men are arguing that there's nothing there to explain this (in fact, Futuyma mentions considerable work done in this field in the past few decades). Mueller's arguing that these advances should be rolled into the EES to further explain what the MES does not quite do *on its own*.

Creationists, apparently especially those on /r/creation, do not comprehend that science does not exist within a bubble, and that, even though one theory or one science does not explain everything that someone thinks it should, does not mean that another theory or science *cannot* explain it. And even when science fails to explain something now, does not preclude it from ever being able to in the future.

Simply looking at the advances in science over the past 100 years would show that, if we stuck with what we knew about the world in 1917, we'd definitely be ignorant fools to think that the world today had not progressed at all, in knowledge or in technology.

To summarize, the theory of evolution as it stands today avoids questions of biological origins because it's not designed to explain them at all, *but other sciences are able to answer some of those questions,* and Mueller makes an argument that perhaps it's time we start incorporating these other sciences into the theory of evolution.",1504384591,11,2017-09-02 16:36:31

In that thread, u/DarwinZDF42 commented on a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6sv0bj/supposed_comparative_embryology/) in r/Creation on Haekel's embryos. He (Darwin) said:

&gt; Now, Haeckel had this other idea, that organisms replay their evolutionary history during development. That was wrong, we know it's wrong, and as somebody who teaching biology to college freshmen, I think I'm qualified to say that nobody teaches Haeckel.

&gt; So when creationists bring up Haeckel in a debate about evolutionary biology, it's the equivalent of arguing ""yeah well they thought the sun orbited around the earth, so modern theories of astronomy are wrong"" in an astronomy debate. It has no bearing on the modern discussion, at all.

Then several other pro-evolutionists chimed in and agreed that Haekel was a dishonest scumbag, but that he was thoroughly discredited way back in the 19th century, and therefore has no relevance to modern evolutionary thinking.

Yet, one of the most popular general biology texts in use today, *Biology* by Raven and Johnson, still included an [entire section](http://imgur.com/a/cHiMI) devoted to Haekel's embryos in its 5th edition, copyrighted 1999! There is no mention of the fact that Haekel was censured by the scientific community back in the 19th century and that his idea was thoroughly debunked, discredited and abandoned.

Now, I personally possess copies of this textbook's 5th (1999) &amp; 10th (2014) editions, so I can testify that Haekel's treatment is present in the 5th and (finally, thankfully) absent in the 10th. But I can't tell you whether it persisted in the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th. I can tell you that the 5th edition boasts that earlier editions sold almost a half-million copies, and we can safely assume that they all included positive treatment of Haekel and his embryos. And the 5th edition continued that tradition into the 21st century, a full century after Haekel was debunked. 

The 5th edition *still* makes the false assertion that human embryos possess a tail that is subsequently lost. As I say, this is patently and demonstrably false. A simple enumeration of the bones in the spinal column easily shows that this ""tail"" is merely the spinal column, growing faster than neighboring tissues.

Furthermore, the text accompanying Figure 58.16 clearly claims that the human embryo, like its ontological progenitors, possesses ""gill slits"". This is unadulterated bunk! Perhaps there was a time when the pharyngeal pouch could have been erroneously confused with nascent gill slits, but decades ago we traced the development paths of this pouch to the hyoid cartilage, middle ear bones and parathyroid and thymus glands. It's clear that the authors were feeling pressure against the claims of gill slits, and they added defenses of their claims in the main text, but it appears that the text in this figure escaped the proof-readers' attention.

So, /u/DarwinZDF42, please admit that millions of college freshmen (perhaps even you) were fed bunk that had been debunked over a century earlier.

Okay, so thats a link to a picture of Rocky Dennis. Now, I'm not trying to offend anyone but I'm using him as an example....
Let's pretend he lived 50,000 years ago and had a brother and a sister with the same disorder. Now, let's say they all are born in what is modern day Greece. He ends up dying at the age of 3 while his siblings end up being like nomads. The sister (who happens to have the most severe case of the deformity) travels to Ukraine but dies at the age of 15 while the brother ends up traveling all the way to Saudi Arabia and manages to live until 30 (he only had a slight, but noticeable disfiguration of his skull). Fast forward to present day... Paleontologists end up finding all their bones. The brother was discovered first in 1990. Scientists are amazing and wonder, is this just a fluke, did people look like this, is this another species or Homo sapiens, did we evolve from this? Then, in 2001, the sister is found. Finally, the 3 year old is found in 2014. Given that this disorder makes excessive calcium grow in facial bones, this would enable the disfigurements to be preserved. Scientists now believe humans looked like this, but evolved out of these traits due to finding 3 different skeletons from 3 different areas, with varying degrees of the mutation, and being some of the oldest human skeletons to be found.
Now, some questions...
* How can we prevent something like this, following false data, from happening today (how can we prevent confusing a genetic disorder from the past to represent how we got here today)?
* How do we know this hasn't happened already (what if some of the other Homo species are actually just flukes and have nothing to do with our evolution)?
* Because of this mutation, it causes eyesight, hearing, and brain damage. However, despite doctors believing Rocky shouldn't be able to learn well due to the brain damage, he still ended up graduating high school with honors. So, would we see these skeletons and come to the conclusion similar to that of the doctors? Could this mean that some of our beliefs about other Homo species learning capacities and brain functionality are potentially wrong?
* What about other deformities? Are there any that you believe or know of that have lead us down a wrong path?",1503606322,20,2017-08-24 16:25:22
387,Testable and inferences from assumptions,10,True,"[Nomenmeum](/u/Nomenmeum) is really fond of making two particular arguments [as in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6uv1hz/biogenesis_again_still_after_all_these_years/dlxgpdm/) but also many others:

1. evolution and abiogenesis are untestable.

2. evolution and abiogenesis produce explanations that are ""just"" inferences made from (naturalistic) assumptions.

I have two questions for him. Not that these will be addressed whatsoever, read my lips, but at least for the more honest debaters here an interesting issue.

First, if evolution and abiogenesis are untestable, why are creationist websites crammed with attempts to falsify them? Because if they were untestable, such attempts would be a priori impossible.

The second point is this: when we observe the fossil record, we clearly see that the biodiversities observed in the subsequent geological formations differ considerably. For instance, in the Cambrian entire classes and orders and genera of organisms are completely lacking. The next ones are completely absent in the Cambrian formations: all fish except the jawless ones, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and terrestial life forms except from bacterial mats. All life in the Cambrian formations is marine. 

This observation basically originates from the first geologists like Smith, Hutton, Lyell, Brognart, Cuvier, Buckland. And you really can't say these were men pre-occupied with naturalistic word views because apart from Smith (of whom we don't know his religious affiliation, which does not exclude he could well had been also a staunch believer), all of these were ardent believers and many of them even initially were adherents to ""catastrophism"", the geological paradigm that the geology we observe is mostly due to catastrophs like the biblical flood (not that they remained thinking so because the advancements in geological obserrvations directly falsifies this caboodle).

So, my second question would be: which inferences would Nomenmeum make from these observations OTHER than the only logical one, that is: the biodiversity has changed throughout the natural history of the Earth. And a changing biodiversity is nothing less than ... evolution.

388,Creationists and quote mining,10,True,"[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6v3hjq/evolutionists_say_the_oddest_things/) has been posted on our favourite subreddit. It's a video all about, as the title would suggest, quotes from evolutionists.

I won't bother going through the whole video, because that would take way too long. Instead I'll just address the highlights. But first, let's address quote mining in general.

Why is quote mining so popular among creationists? No actual science uses quote mines. Even other pseudosciences and conspiracy theories rarely quote mine. It's almost exclusively a creationist thing.

I believe part of the answer is how most scientists are skeptical of evolution. Before anyone tries to take that quote out of context, skepticism doesn't mean doubt. Good scientists are always skeptical of everything, especially their own disciplines. They are happy to honestly inquire about the weaknesses of their sciences. It's not hard for a dedicated movement to take these incidents of skepticism, and use them to claim doubt in evolution and its evidence.

There are a lot of good reasons why quote mines do not work as actual evidence. Most importantly, the data is what counts, not what scientists say. If a scientist says there are no transitional fossils, it doesn't mean a thing if we have actual examples of transitional fossils that anyone can see.

Second, most of these quotes are taken out of context. A good rule of thumb is to read the quote as it is, rather than what the quoters say it means. For example, this is the first quote in the video linked above:

&gt; I don’t think believing that Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection (his version or today’s version) commits you to religious belief. I think that if, as I myself would, you extend the scope of the theory to an understanding of knowledge acquisition and justification and the same for morality — evolutionary epistemology and evolutionary ethics — then it can act as a religion substitute or alternative. It gives you a world picture that some people, starting with me, find entirely satisfying.

The hosts claim the author is saying ""evolution is a religion"". But, is that really what it says? No. The exact words are ""it can act as a religion **substitute or alternative**"", not a religion itself. If you read the full article, [available here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ruse/is-darwinism-a-religion_b_904828.html), you will see the author is specifically saying that it's not a religion, just that, in some cases, it shares traits of religion.

Another thing to look out for is quotes by Stephen Jay Gould that mention gradualism, gradual evolution, or something of the sort. It's true that Stephen Jay Gould will say that there is no fossil evidence for gradual evolution. The layperson may believe that gradual evolution is all evolution, and Gould is saying there's no fossil evidence for evolution. This is false, because gradual evolution is actually a specific type of evolution, that Gould contrasts with punctuated equilibrium. He's not saying there's no fossil evidence for evolution, just one particular type of evolution.

When looking into a fair few of these quote mines, I noticed a lot of them can't be verified. A lot of them come from private letters, or one off lectures. If they were being honest, they would only stick to quotes that can be verified.

The last main reason that quote mines aren't actual evidence, is that individual scientist claims don't necessarily represent the consensus. There are hundreds of thousands of life scientists in America alone. There are no doubt a small minority who have unconventional beliefs about evolution, even if they don't identify as creationists. They might believe that dinosaurs didn't evolve into birds, or that evolution justifies genocide, or even that evolution is false.

Now onto the video's highlights:

We open with a statement that they're not taking quotes out of context. That would be nice, except their very first quote, described above, is taken out of context. What's particularly good is their explanation for why they aren't taking any of them out of context. They say ""They're not saying they're creationists, they still believe in evolution."" I don't even know where to begin on that one. What does claiming someone's a creationist or not have to do with being in context? Sure, if you're using the quote to say they're creationists it would be relevant, but what if you're using the quote to say evolution is a religion, or there are no transitional fossils, or evolution is baseless?

Another laugh comes when they say that they're putting the references to each quote, so you can look them up for yourself. We all know exactly zero creationists are going to be looking up any of these quotes. Even the makers of this video didn't look them up, which we know because the very first quote is out of context.

About half way into the video, it uses a quote by esteemed scientist, and bastion of mental health, Jeffrey Dahmer. That's right, creationists are using a deranged serial killer as an authority on evolution.

In one of the intermissions between quotes, they address scientists and engineers that mimic features found in nature. Of course, this goes on to a watchmaker argument. But what's really funny, they accuse the scientists that do this of plagiarism. That's right, they believe they're plagiarizing God.

That's about all I can stomach for now. I might post a few of these quotes they used later on, and address their dishonesty.",1503459971,46,2017-08-22 23:46:11

391,Biogenesis again - still after all these years,8,True,"In the [echochamber](/r/creation) [Nomenmeum](/u/nomenmeum) is re-iterating the old canard again of [Pasteur's law of biogenesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6uikat/the_irrational_faith_of_evolutionnaturalism/dlswqdx/).

As usual we first have to deal with the habitual quote mining, in this case the sayings of George Wald, who *supposedly* wrote:

&gt; ""When it comes to the origin of life on this earth, there are only two possibilities: creation or spontaneous generation. There is no third way. Spontaneous generation was disproved 100 years ago, but that leads us only to one other conclusion: that of supernatural creation. We cannot accept that on philosophical grounds; therefore, we choose to believe the impossible: that life arose spontaneously by chance."" 

Which supposedly came from a 1958 article.

This quote is a complete fabrication. ""Quote"" is not even correct as a paraphrase here. Wald exactly said *the opposite*. It is often breathtaking how creationists manage to lay words in the mouth of scientists that turn out to be diametrically the opposite. This majestic dexterity in juggling is telling.

To prove how deceitful this quote mine is, I only have to quote one single line in Wald's 1958 article ""The Origin of Life,"" which actually appeared in the August 1954 (pages 44-53) issue of Scientific American:

&gt; I think a scientist has no choice but to approach the origin of life through a hypothesis of spontaneous generation. What the controversy reviewed above showed to be untenable is only the belief that living organisms arise spontaneously under present conditions. We have now to face a somewhat different problem: how organisms may have arisen spontaneously under different conditions in some former period, granted that they do so no longer.

But, apart from this habitual deceit, we still have Pasteur's law of biogenesis. Which is, frankly, an old canard.

And its irrelevance in explaining the origin of life by abiogenesis is not rocket science.

Pasteur experiments were on falsifying that modern, complex life can spontaneously originate from dead material. So here are the *conditions* of Pasteur's experiments:

1. modern life in its achieved complexity.

2. substrates: grape skins, broths and fermental liquids.

The spontaneous generation that Pasteur disproved was the idea that life forms such as mice, maggots, and bacteria in their extant, rather complex form can appear already fully formed from biologically derived food sources. 

So his conclusions are confined to *those* conditions. Expanding these results to complete other conditions is just lousy science and goes against abut all relevant metodological and logical rules.

They do not apply to *other* conditions, like those proposed by biologists pertaining the origin of life by natural means:

- the first life which is conceived to be much less complex.

- in pond or ocean water that does not contain biologically derived food sources but to an extent is saturated with the elementary biochemical building blocks of life. The abiotic forming of those elementary buildings blocks already has been demonstrated and isn't an issue any more.

You are not allowed to transplant the results of experiments to other conditions than the ones that were set for the experiment. There is no law of biogenesis implying that very primitive life cannot form from increasingly complex molecules.

Pasteur's experiment merely disproved a form of creationism though, because creationism is all about the generation of already complex life in its current forms out of nothing. Exactly what Pasteur falsified. And to justify this exception on the law of biogenesis, creationists only need to assume ""Poof!"" (=god busy creating). And it's even worse because creationism assumes that life, the world and cosmos were created *out of nothing* (""creatio ex nihilo"" it's called in theology) by an supernatural entity we by definition cannot observe or tell whether it actually exists. How plausible.

It is also breathtaking how creationists often ruin by own admission their stance - quote from CreationWiki (Sic!!! is mine):

&gt; This commentary on Pasteur’s work shows how someone can turn a person’s findings on its head to advocate their own position [**SIC!!!!!!**]. Biblical creationism admits that Deity would have the ability to form life fully formed at will. Since Pasteur’s work is limited to the natural world, the world of the adherent of naturalism, that is where it should remain. Statements about the ability of the supernatural cannot be derived from Louis Pasteur’s investigations. 

And that's another way of telling that creationism is pseudoscience because creationism DOES make statements about the natural world, namely how life, the world and universe originated and the diversity of life.

399,"A quick evo-devo lesson, since r/creation seems confused on the topic",14,True,"Oh boy, [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6sv0bj/supposed_comparative_embryology/) is what happens when people who don't know biology think they do. 

 

A few quick points.

 

Developmental biology can inform and support evolutionary theory not because organisms replay their evolutionary history during development, but because the more general characteristics of a group develop earlier, followed by the more specific characteristics. In evolutionary terms, this means that more ancestral (i.e. more ancient) traits tend to appear earlier, while more derived (i.e. more recent) traits tend to appear later.

So we can compare different organisms, and the degree to which they share traits at different stages of development *can be* informative with regard to the relative relatedness among different species or groups. 

 

For example, during vertebrate development, the notochord appears earlier than the vertebral column. So if you compare a vertebrate to say a cephalochordate very early on, they're going to look more alike than later in their respective developmental processes. 

 

Now, Haeckel had this other idea, that organisms replay their evolutionary history during development. That was wrong, we know it's wrong, and as somebody who teaching biology to college freshmen, I think I'm qualified to say that *nobody teaches Haeckel*. 

So when creationists bring up Haeckel in a debate about evolutionary biology, it's the equivalent of arguing ""yeah well they thought the sun orbited around the earth, so modern theories of astronomy are wrong"" in an astronomy debate. It has no bearing on the modern discussion, at all.

408,Claims of a Creationist Trucker,11,True,"Brett here has a bunch of strong feelings about creationism and evolution. Please lay into them.
https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Passmore/log

Some examples:

On Geological Layering

>Respondent: ""The Grand Canyon is over 6,000 feet deep in places. It has neat, straight lines of geologic strata""

>Brett: Yes... VERY straight lines, indicating rapid deposition. There obviously was not vast amounts of time and erosion.

>Respondent: ""This itself (deep canyons) isn’t any sort of proof, since creating a deep canyon is possible in the abrahamic mythology.""

>Brett: Hmmmm... It seems you start with the conclusion the Bible is myth, then reject science which contradicts your bias. If you are familiar with the journal 'Nature', here is an article on rapid canyon formation. http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n7/full/ngeo894.html?foxtrotcallback=true

>Respondent: ""This little guy is a Trilobite. He was a sea creature, and is found in the lower layers of the canyon. He’s extinct. There’s no way he burrowed through millions of tons of rock, when he died there was a sea floor where he was. Layers built up over him after that.""

>Brett: Hmmm.. (again). Why are you arguing against something you don't understand... a strawman argument. Of course bottom dwelling marine creatures are in the lowest levels. And, actually the grand canyon fossils provide fantastic evidence of a catastrophic event and rapid burial. Trilobites have a very sophisticated vision system with no evidence of gradual step by step vision uphill evolution.

>Respondent: ""This, of course, debunks the 6,000 year old earth theory...""

>Brett: 6000 year old earth is a belief based on evidence. (Call it a theory if you wish)

>Respondent: ""since at this point it would take a foot of buildup per year to grow the canyon to it’s current size""

>Brett: Steven, you are tilting at windmills. Rather than create arguments you think you can defeat, why not learn your 'oppositions' views, so you can argue more effectively?

>Respondent: ""(not counting the time the river takes to cut through it,""

>Brett: So, do you think the Colorado river ran uphill and carved the canyon over millions of years?

>Respondent: ""Well, the fossils stop being undersea fossils after a while. We get animal tracks and plants a little ways up.""

>Brett: The Grand Canyon fossils and layers are excellent evidence supporting the creation model and rapid burial and preservation.

>Respondent: ""The problem there is that fossils don’t exist for just extinct species. They exist for extant (things still living) species as well. We can tell when a creature first appeared by seeing where it’s fossil record starts.""

>Brett: That belief, (where creatures start and stop in the fossil record)has lead to a number of false and sometimes embarassing conclusions by evolutionists. For example coelacanths were not a fish in shallow ancient seas with stubby limbs, and primitive lungs, that went extinct 65 million years ago. They live today deep in the ocean..no limbs...no lungs...and not extinct.

>Respondent: ""There are ZERO extant species in these lower layers. There are no modern sea creatures with the trilobites.""

>Brett: Modern jellyfish would be one example proving you wrong. They appear the same as fossilized jellyfish dated at 500MY. We can look at the lower geological levels and see the sudden appearance of many, many organisms with NO evidence of gradual transitions and increasing complexity. And we see extinctions consistent with the Biblical model.

>Respondent: ""...You find these layers everywhere, and everywhere you don’t find modern species or even modern kinds""

>Brett:Actually we do find some modern creatures buried in layers that surprise evolutionists. Invariably the fossil is assigned as a different species, not based on science but beliefs. The word species has rubbery definitions but usually it involves the organisms ability to mate with other similar creatures. For example, quite a few birds similar to modern birds have been found in dinosaur layers. According to evolutionists, if it walks like a duck, and looks like a duck...it isn't a duck if its in the 'wrong' layer.

>Respondent: ""If people existed on the sixth day, we’d see evidence of people in deeper layers.""

>Brett: No... humans and trilobites have 'slightly' different environments. Likewise we don't expect monkeys to be buried with fish during a flood. Also... from God's Word, we wonder if there is no such thing as pre-flood human fossils, since God said He would destroy humans from the face of the earth, other than those on the ark.

On Archaeopteryx

> Archaeoptetyx was a bird... feathers like todays birds and capable of flight. It did have some unique traits...but MANY birds have unique traits.  An article in  Scientific American tells us that archaeoptetyx feathers seem to have appeared in a flash... its a miracle! "" Archaeopteryx seemed to emerge fully fledged with the characteristics of modern birds,” said Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England...To explain this miraculous metamorphosis..."" https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dinosaurs-shrank-and-became-birds/

On ERVs in apes

>Questioner: ""Okay, what ERVs are not consistent with evolutionary hierarchies?""

>Brett: Example... ""We performed two analyses to determine whether these 12 shared map intervals might indeed be orthologous. First, we examined the distribution of shared sites between species (Table S3). We found that the distribution is inconsistent with the generally accepted phylogeny of catarrhine primates. This is particularly relevant for the human/great ape lineage."" Lineage-Specific Expansions of Retroviral Insertions within the Genomes of African Great Apes but Not Humans and Orangutans

On the Fossil Record

>Brett: We find fossilized pollen, jellyfish, modern vascular plants, giant ferns, whole dinosurs in the drowning position, footprints, Soft dino tissue in fossils, turtles 'doing it', feeding fish, fossilized whale pod, birds and mammals in dino tummies and more. The fossil record provides excellent evidence for sudden appearance of all basic kinds, and a catastrophic event where there was sudden burial in waterborne sediment.

On ""Junk DNA""

>Brett: ""Pseudogenes have long been labeled as ""junk"" DNA, failed copies of genes that arise during the evolution of genomes. However, recent results are challenging this moniker; indeed, some pseudogenes appear to harbor the potential to regulate their protein-coding cousins. Far from being silent relics, many pseudogenes are transcribed into RNA, some exhibiting a tissue-specific pattern of activation. Pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs that regulate coding genes through the RNAi pathway. In another remarkable discovery, it has been shown that pseudogenes are capable of regulating tumor suppressors and oncogenes by acting as microRNA decoys. The finding that pseudogenes are often deregulated during cancer progression warrants further investigation into the true extent of pseudogene function. In this review, we describe the ways in which pseudogenes exert their effect on coding genes and explore the role of pseudogenes in the increasingly complex web of noncoding RNA that contributes to normal cellular regulation"" The article closes with warning similar to what creationists have been saying for years not to assume that pseudogenes are ""nonfunctional relics""because that has caused them to be ""overlooked in the quest to understand the biology of health and disease"":  RNA, Vol. 17:792-798 (2011).

>Respondent: ""Transposons do literally nothing but copy themselves and screw up the genes they insert themselves into. Maybe, just maybe it can result in something useful. More likely it will just mess things up.""

>Brett: You seem to use old evolutionist arguments from 20 years ago, that science has disproven. Your argument about transposons are no different than the old junk DNA, and psuedogene arguments. Science is still in the process of revealing purpose and function in transposons... such as molecular switch functions.

General Summation

>Respondent: ""Believe me, if there was a article that, with clear scientific methodology and sound statistics shows that the theory of evolution is wrong, it would be all over the high ranking journals!""

>Brett: No... sorry, I don't believe that. When a secular journal prints anything with even a hint at intelligent design, their subcrscribers complain. Likewise 'Journal of Creation' does not accept articles that promote common ancestry.

>Respondent: ""Let’s start at the very basic principles and work our way up. What’s a mutation? - A change in the DNA.""

>Brett: It's more than just a change...its a copying error...its a mistake. I'm sure you are aware of many secular articles where geneticists express concern about the accumulation of these mistakes in our genome. Geneticist Crow says "" each mutation leads to one genetic death"". He says that the mildly deleterious mutations ""has no overt effect but shows up as a small decrease in viability or fertility"". (http://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8380.full)

>Respondent: ""Let’s say you have just DNA floating around with nothing else but the machinery to copy it.

>Brett: So...if I understand correctly, you want to assume a strand of useless DNA?

>Respondent: ""Now let’s go a step further. Let’s say, the DNA actually codes for something. ..... Now we can have three more types of mutations! They are called silent, nonsense and missense mutations. ""

>Brett: I feel like you are trying to sell something when you suggest mutations are / can be 'silent' . Geneticists refer to mutations as ""mildly deleterious""...""genetic death""....""very slightly deleterious""...""near neutral"".... etc. AND.... it is these type of mutations that geneticists are most concerned with. For ex. Higgins and Lynch said that because mildly deleterious mutations are almost invisible to natural selection that they make great considerably larger mutational load (http://m.pnas.org/content/98/5/2928.full) Or, mathematician Hoyle in 'Mathematics of Evolution says "" natural selection cannot turn back deleterious mutations if they are small, and over a long time a large number of small disadvantages escalate to a serious handicap"".

>Respondent: ""....Same story with bacteria: I’m sure you must have heard of antibiotic resistance.""

>Brett: Yes, I have heard of that. :) Bacteria are wee bit different from us to make comparisons re mutations, adaptation etc.
I will give the creationist perspective. Life on earth; our existence depends on many many types of bacteria. We can't live without them. Bacteria need to be able to rapidly adapt to chaging environments. Bacteria are able to exchange genetic info in unique ways, which seems to be a designed response. Their reproductive rate allows them to survive a high mutation rate. Although most bacteria is good and neccesary, a small percentage has become harmful which is consistent with the good creation, which is now subject to entropy

>Respondent: ""Just as in the song about Rudolph the reindeer: The Reindeer might have a mutation that causes red glowing noses, which under normal reindeer conditions is considered “bad” as he’s been made fun of.

This all came from a single experiment where researchers would generate thousands of randomised DNA sequences and then insert them along with their necessary replication machinery into the genomes of E-coli.

In an article about the study, one of the researchers recounts:

> During my early months in the Tautz lab, while still a Master’s student, I contemplated the possibility of doing an experiment that could support de novo evolution as a general process, and so I came up with a thought experiment. I would insert random sequences in living cells, together with enough regulatory machinery to make sure they would be transcribed and translated by the host. Then, I would wait until any of those would mutate enough to “acquire a function.” It occurred to me that starting with a sufficiently large pool of random sequences would reduce the waiting time, because some would exhibit some biochemical activity upon their introduction.

The results were surprising - they generated hundreds of randomized genes that were beneficial to the bacteria that received them. In some cases the new functional genes acted at the RNA level, and in other cases through the new protein that was produced.

> Our experiments show that an unexpectedly large fraction of random RNA or peptide sequences are bioactive, at least in the sense of influencing relative growth rates in E. coli cells. The results imply that it could be either the RNA itself, or the corresponding translated protein that conveys the bioactivity. Although two of our three individually tested clones suggest that the RNA function could be more important than the protein function, this constitutes at present only a small sample and may not be indicative of the true ratio between RNA and peptide functions. However, this observation fits well with the notion that an active RNA may precede an active peptide during de novo gene evolution of genes

Also, obviously, /r/Creation doesn't accept that mutations can be beneficial. At this point, I don't care to repeat it again and again.

A few days ago [the video](https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.mclatchie/videos/10155087811921943/) was made available, so naturally I not only sat through this train wreck, but took notes. 

So why don’t ERVs support common ancestry? Let’s find out!

 

Objection 1. ERVs have functions, therefore their location is due to selection rather than chance.

Can you name an example of a functional ERV? Go to about 1:27:15 or so remaining for the amazing answer.

He fumbles for a moment, and final comes up with…syncytins! Except that **isn’t a functional ERV.** Syncytins are genes acquired from retroviruses via horizontal gene transfer. They are not functional ERVs.

(Seriously, this is amazing. This is the most obvious question one should expect in this situation. Did he just not prepare, or are there really no actual examples? My money is on both.)

Any other examples? Nope. Just some vague hand-waving about how we see functions when we look. 

 

Objection 2: Evolution won’t preserve nonfunctional DNA, so ERVs must have a function. 

Wrong. Selection will preserve neutral features. As long as there is no cost to keeping ERVs and other classes of junk DNA (and therefore no advantage to losing it), it’ll just hang out. 

 

Objection 3: Something about just replacing some other protein – I’ve never heard this argument and I don’t really understand the point he was trying to make. 

 

Then something I’m not sure is an objection, about how target site duplication as a hallmark of integration – “that’s just how retroviruses work.” So wait he acknowledges they’re inserted viruses, it’s just specific in some way and therefore designed. No evidence of some invisible guiding hand behind the processes is provided. 

 

Obejction 4: Even though phylogenies generated using ERVs correlate strongly to other phylogenies, it’s not an argument for common ancestry, because…

* you can’t tell when they inserted (false – age is correlated with LTR length, for example).

* it might be due to convergence (sure, it *might*. And unicorns might be real).

* you can’t say which species got insertion first (it’s the common ancestor of the species that have a homologous ERV. He doesn’t get how common ancestry works, it seems).

* you get different trees if you use different parts of the genome (yes? that’s why you don’t cherry-pick, you use as much data as you can).

 

There’s more discussion in this video, but it wanders into other topics, including a cameo by Sal f’ing Cordova, and some evidence-free discussion of dinosaurs on the ark. But that’s really it for ERVs. Nothing new. And almost nothing factually correct. Total amateur hour.

429,Creationists Accidentally Make Case for Evolution,19,True,"In what is perhaps my favorite case of cognitive dissonance ever, a number of creationists over at, you guessed it, r/creation are making arguments *for* evolution. 

It's this thread: [I have a probably silly question. Maybe you folks can help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6li54u/i_have_a_probably_silly_question_maybe_you_folks/)

This is the key part of the OP: 

>I've heard often that two of each animals on the ark wouldn't be enough to further a specie. I'm wondering how this would work.

 

Basically, it comes down to this: How do you go from two individuals to all of the diversity we see, in like 4000 years? 

>The problem with this is that under Mendelian principles of inheritance, not allowing for the possibility of information-adding mutations, you can only have at most four different alleles for any given gene locus.

>That's not what we see - there are often dozens of different alleles for a particular gene locus. That is not consistent with ancestry traced to only a pair of individuals.

So...either we don't have recent descent from two individuals, and/or evolution can generate novel traits.

Yup!

 

>There are lots of genes where mutations have created many degraded variants. And it used to be argued that HLA genes had too many variants before it was discovered new variants arose rapidly through gene conversion. But which genes do you think are too varied?

And we have another mechanism: Gene conversion! Other than the arbitrary and subjective label ""degraded,"" they're doing a great job making a case for evolution. 

 

And then this last exchange in this subthread:

>If humanity had 4 alleles to begin with, but then a mutation happens and that allele spreads (there are a lot of examples of genes with 4+ alleles that is present all over earth) than this must mean that the mutation was beneficial, right? If there's genes out there with 12+ alleles than that must mean that at least 8 mutations were beneficial and spread.

Followed by

>Beneficial or at least non-deleterious. It has been shown that sometimes neutral mutations fixate just due to random chance.

Wow! So now we're adding fixation of neutral mutations to the mix as well. Do they all count as ""degraded"" if they're neutral?

 

To recap, the mechanisms proposed here to explain how you go from two individuals to the diversity we see are mutation, selection, drift (neutral theory FTW!), and gene conversion (deep cut!). 

If I didn't know better, I'd say the creationists are making a case *for* evolutionary theory. 

 

EDIT: u/JohnBerea continues to do so in this thread, arguing, among other things, that new phenotypes can appear without generating lots of novel alleles simply due to recombination and dominant/recessive relationships among alleles for quantitative traits (though he doesn't use those terms, this is what he describes), and that HIV has accumulated ""only"" several thousand mutations since it first appeared less than a century ago.

430,"I got a question about genetic entropy, so gather 'round, and let me tell you why the ""genetic entropy"" argument is nonsense",16,True,"Genetic entropy. One of my favorite topics. Get comfy, this turned out to be much longer than I thought it would be. I got a question about this in a PM, and I figure I might as well share the answer with everyone. So next time you hear this nonsense, this is why it's nonsense. 

 

That term, ""genetic entropy,"" is, as far as I can tell, a term made up by creationists to make evolutionary theory seem impossible. It is defined as the accumulation of harmful mutations to the point where a species suffers such a high fitness cost that it goes extinct. 

 

The actual term for what they're trying to describe is ""error catastrophe,"" which is when harmful mutations accumulate at a rate the eventually causes the average rate of reproduction in a population to fall below 1 (meaning less than 1 offspring per individual), so the population shrinks and eventually goes extinct. 

Error catastrophe requires a very specific set of conditions. Mutations have to accumulate at a sufficient rate. A sufficient percentage of mutations have to be harmful. And selection and recombination working together have to be unable to clear the harmful mutations. In other words, the mutations have to happen faster than natural selection can cause the genomes *without* the harmful mutations to increase in frequency.

 

These conditions are so rare and specific that they have never, *never* been observed in natural populations. We think some kinds of viruses mutate fast enough to be pretty close to the threshold, but nothing is actually experiencing error catastrophe. We know this because we can measure the reproductive rate in whatever population you want to study, and we find that none are below 1, and when we measure, for example, these viruses in the lab, they don't ""slow down"" over time. 

 

There is the idea that we can induce error catastrophe by treating fast-mutating populations with a mutagen. This has been tried a number of times, but it's never been conclusively shown to work. Ever. You can find studies that *claim* to have induced error catastrophe, but they are lacking. [This](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541) is a good overview of this body of research. 

The thing is, fast-mutating viruses like RNA viruses or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the ideal organisms to target for lethal mutagenesis. They have small, dense genomes (>90% of the bases are within protein-coding regions), and in some cases, overlapping offset reading frames, so there aren't even wobble sites. So a high percentage of mutations ought to be harmful. If this is going to work in any organisms, it's these viruses. 

 

Now look at humans. We have genomes that are *much* less dense. about 2% protein-coding, and about 10% functional in total. So a much, much lower percentage of human mutations will be harmful. How much less? Well, figure 90% are neutral because they occur in non-functional regions. Of the remaining 10%, some occur in regions or at sites that don't require base specificity, only that a base is present - wobble sites or spacer DNA, for example. Mutations to these bases will also be neutral. That's going to be not quite a third of the coding DNA (there can be selection for synonymous codons, but it's really, really weak, so we're just going to call that neutral. Because it's so weak we can't measure the effects. Source: I've tried.), plus a ton of the functional-but-not-coding DNA, since so much of it is spacer or structural. So we're looking at low-to-mid single digits for the percentage of mutations that are actually harmful in humans. 

But then you add in the effects of sexual reproduction and recombination. These allow us to decouple good mutations from bad ones, allowing the bad mutations to be removed via natural selection (i.e. individuals with bad mutations have lower reproductive success), meaning these mutations don't accumulate from generation to generation. 

 

The argument creationists use in response to the above is that there are mutations called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" or VSDMs. Mutations that are harmful, but have such small effects that selection cannot remove them. So they accumulate over time and cause a decline in reproductive output over many many generations. 

 

There are a lot of problems with this argument. Let's go through them.

First, fitness effects are context dependent. There are very few mutations that are inherently, universally beneficial or harmful. Fitness effects depend on the genetic and ecological context in which they occur. So if a mutation has no fitness effects, it isn't a VSDM. It's neutral. Period. 

Second, for VSDMs to be the drivers of error catastrophe, they have to accumulate slowly enough to not be subject to selection, but also rapidly enough to drive a decrease in fitness. But these two things cannot simultaneously occur. If they cause a decline in fitness, then the individuals with the VSDMs have fewer offspring, and those mutations become *less* common. Which means that in order for error catastrophe to happen, a large number of mutations have to occur in a single generation. But...

Third, if harmful mutations were accumulating, either very slowly or in a big burst, we'd see the effects: Reproductive output would decline. Needless to say, the number of humans keeps increasing. There is zero evidence of a global decline in fitness. Localized decreases in reproductive output are due to choices, not physiology. 

 

So where does that leave ""genetic entropy""? Without a leg to stand on. It hasn't even been induced in the fastest mutating organisms on earth, with genomes that are perfect target for it. Given the lower density, lower mutation rates, and sexual reproduction in humans, there's zero chance we're experiencing error catastrophe. And the icing on the cake is the contradiction it requires to work: The mutations have to have effects so minor, selection cannot act on them (i.e. they are neutral), but they also have to be harmful enough to cause not just a measurable decline in fitness over time, but a *terminal* decline in fitness over time. Those two things cannot simultaneously happen. 

The genetic entropy argument is nonsense from top to bottom. ",1499561274,70,2017-07-08 20:47:54

Commentary: This comment doesn't satisfy the challenge. It's an analogy which states that a design implies a designer. I specifically asked about providing evidence for creationism. However, this is merely a teleological argument.

Additionally: The analogy is 200+ years old and is alternatively and satisfyingly explained by the Theory Of Evolution, which came 50 years after the analogy was first made.

I was curious and searched for top unanswered questions in chemistry, biology, geology (which becomes earth science), medicine, ecology, archaeology, and evolution.

Chemistry doesn't have a whole lot that are strictly chemistry. Medicine is mostly about finding cures for diseases. Subcategories of physics have their own top unanswered questions: astronomy, cosmology

But the striking thing is **there is no list of unanswered questions about evolution** except those written by creationist/ID organizations such as Discovery Institute or Creation.com.  I'm quite surprised at this. It seems that evolution is the one field where they don't want to admit that there are any problems. Look at the lists on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_unsolved_problems  There is none for evolution. *(Note that I was not just looking at Wikipedia in this exercise).*

I think that because of the creation-evolution conflict and extreme give-no-quarter polarization in the ~~civilized debate~~ bloody fight, that evolutionists cannot bring themselves to publish a list of unsolved problems.

Please only educated responses, as this is a serious post, and flippant or emotional comments will be ignored.  Going into this I already have low Karma in this Sub, so I have a 7 minute freeze after every post...so please be patient with my responses.

Edit:  Also, I prefer to debate individuals, not Wikipedia or other links.  So if you are not able to personally speak to a topic, please do not comment.  If you are linking something that better explains your position, or is supporting material...by all means.

Overall Positions

1 - The debate between Evolution and Creation is not a debate about Science vs Religion.  It is a debate about the correct history of the planet, specifically Uniformitarianism vs Catastrophism.

**Geological**

Evidence #1: The eruption of Mt. St. Helens produced 350,000 to 2,000,000 year old rocks although they were actually born in 1980.  

Position#1 - This shows a limitation of certain types of Radiometric Dating.

Evidence #2 - The eruption and subsequent activity surrounding this eruption carved a 600 foot channel carved into bedrock within a couple of days.  

Position - This is a powerful example of the capabilities of Catastrophism, and large scale events could feasibly carve out the Grand Canyon in geologically short time frames.

Option #1 Colorado River cut the grand canyon over eons
Option #2 Hopee Buttes filled with water, and then breached, flowing west and carving the grand canyon quickly.

Evidence #3 The Great unconformity has been found Continent wide in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa.  This erosional boundary represents 1/2 a Billion years.  Because it is so widespread, you would expect to see uniform deposition for future layers.  However, the Schnebly Hill formation which is 800 to 1,000 feet think is not found in the Grand Canyon which is only 70 miles away.  
Position:  Because the Great Unconformity and the greater Sauk Megasequence cover most of North America including the Grand Canyon and surrounding areas; according to uniformitarian theory we should see the Schnebly hill formation in the Grand Canyon.  Since we do not see this, further evidence in the area points to catastrophism as the logical explanation (see below)

Evidence #4 We find Crossbedding with angles of 15 to 25 degrees the 200,000 square miles of the Coconino Sandstone around the grand canyon and surrounding areas.  

Position - This is consistent with underwater deposition.  If this had been deposited like desert sand dunes we would be looking at 30 to 34 degree crossbedding.

**Conventional Paradigm**

Evolution requires being built from the simplest to the most complex.  Creation supposes design with complexity built into the original design.

Position:  The Cambrian Explosion, and the appearance of the dinosaurs as fully formed is an example of complexity from the beginning, not simplicity.

**Paleontological**

Evidence #5: Nautloid fossil beds show entire ecosystems were deposited catastrophically.  This clip is not part of the movie, but I have heard this argument before, and would like a rebuttal, as I have yet to hear a single evolutionary refutation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aNlb3lFhFM

Evidence #6 Animal trackways found, footprints first and bodyparts later.  This indicates Layering had to happen quickly, death and fossilization in an instant.  

Position - Fossilization occurred very quickly, indicating catastrophism... evidence has been shown globally.  I have also heard this argument before... sometimes cited with a fossil that was pregnant or giving birth... indicating quick burial. 

Evidence #7 - In the Lance formation we have 5,000 to 10,000 animals buried.  Little bones on top, Big Bones on the bottom.

Position - This shows catastrophic emplacement.  Dinosaurs look like dinosaurs from the beginning, with complexity.

**Biological**

Evidence #8 Triceratops horn from Hellcreek formation in Montana, soaked in EDT - 80, contained intact collagen and other protein fibers that were stretchy and pristine.  This fossil bed was anything but ideal conditions, and yet survival is impressive.

Position - With those terrible conditions, it is unlikely for this tissue to have survived for 60+Million years.  

Evidence #9 In the Fossil record there are not just missing links between Humans and human ancestors, there are missing links between literally everything that we see, and their supposed ancestors.

Position - This is to be expected within a creationist paradigm, and is a direct challenge to fossil evidentiary support of evolution.  

Evidence #10 Neanderthal Skull - Low forhead, midface is pulled out.  Looks very human Lands on the Human side  
Position - Ostralopithacus africanus - no forehead, face sloped forward. - Is not human. contains discontinuity.

Evidence #11 - The color of the Oryx of the Sahara desert blend perfectly into their surroundings.
Position - The ability to fit an environment must be built into a system before it starts.

Evidence #12 - We see a tremendous amount of mutualism/interdependance in ecosystems.  When we remove only a couple factors, the entire system breaks down.
Position - Creationism would allow interdependance to occur at the highest level of complexity, from the beginning.  Evolution does not allow for initial complexity, and certain ecosystems would not have been able to function.

Evidence #13 DNA is 4 dimensional.  It contains not only a long string of nucleotides in 1 dimension, but contains interactions in 2 dimensions, then folds in 3d in order to produce, for example, a protein that kills a toxin... and this occurs over time which is the 4th dimension.  This is Dynamic 4D DNA programming... this requires everything to be working properly all at once which is extremely complex.  

Position: This complexity could not be built one letter at a time.

Evidence #14 Random small changes in Computer code does not result in increasing complexity of the system, but corruption.  

Position:  Systems need to be designed from the beginning with the ability to adapt to the environment, developing complexity or true novelty (something not previously seen or not from a genetic background) based on random mutation has not been demonstrated.  


**Astronomical**

Evidence #15 - A solar eclipse is a phenomenon that only happens on planet earth.
Position - This is not a coincidence.  In the same way intelligent life has not been found on any other planet in the Universe.

Evidence #16 The ring systems of certain planets show a young age.
Position - They are young, and should not be there.

**Archaeological**

Evidence #17 According to Douglas Petrovich we see a Post Babel dispersion- In and around Eridu where different languages pop up out of nowhere, with a great diversity.  Similar architecture found all over the globe... Ziggurats.

Position - This is indicative of consistency with the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel and the dispersion of people groups and new language creation.

443,How snakes lost their limbs,16,True,"A while ago [Nomenmeum](/u/nomenmeum) wrote a post about whale evolution [in the echochamber](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6banny/whale_evolution_vs_the_actual_fossil_evidence/). Its subtitle was ""the actual fossil evidence"" but nevertheless covered almost NOTHING of the actual fossil evidence.

Partly in order to correct this ignorance and deceit, I wrote [a rebuttal](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6bvsow/creationists_tryiong_to_wrap_their_heads_around/), presenting the ACTUAL fossil evidence that was left out. [DarwinZDF42](/u/DarwinZDF42) also started [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6c16wx/that_whale_evolution_video_debunked_point_by_point/) addressing this terrible crap.

***OF COURSE*** nobody from the echochamber bothered to react to my post. When you do not like the observations, you just ""La, la, la, f#ck you, didn't read that"" skip them or feign they do not exist.

In my language there's a proverb, freely translated: those who keep silent often tell the truth.

So I just LOVE to elaborate so now and then further on the *actual* and *relevant* evidence of evolution (instead of the strawmen, ignoring and distortions by creationists).

This case: snakes.

According to the Bronze Age mythology scribblings, snakes lost their limbs as punishment by God after having lured Eva into the Fall. Apart from this being utter, infantile nonsense - how would a sensible god punish a SNAKE, an animal without any self-consciousness and thus not be held responsible for its deeds, snakes DO NOT EVEN perform deeds, they behave according to their imprinted instincts and reflexes - and when the Snake in the Garden of Eden was supposed to be possessed by Satan, why then not cursing Satan instead of the poor animal - let alone all of its congeners that weren't even involved in the case - this crap deserves only [to be mocked and ridiculed](https://youtu.be/J8lTLhx7f1c?t=10m25s).

So let's have what science tells about snakes losing their limbs.

We already know from [the fossil record](https://pterosaurheresies.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/pontosaurus_kornhuberi_10002.jpg) that snakes [evolved from limbed animals](https://www.livescience.com/51649-four-legged-snake-fossil.html).

[Many extant species of skinks](https://etb-visual-evolution.blogspot.nl/2012/05/snakes-with-legs-snake-evolution.html) have very rudimentary legs left they can't use anymore for the primary purpose of legs locomotion)- because they are too small and feeble in proportion to the very long body shape. These extant species are on the verge of losing their limbs as well. They are transitional species right among us.

Then we have snakes species [with vestigial legs](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u3SSuL7EdxmKWpd-BuViRKP9g8Ml-ZaaZPd18OC-1jLDVV0BZgV3f9ggilDZJux9YEquWbirejlhxs7-vP7-NXt5Xg=s0-d). Those snake species retain pelvic girdles and small rudiments of the femur. 

But a recent study nails it even harder. In [their 2016 article](https://tinyurl.com/ybola88d) ""Loss and Re-emergence of Legs in Snakes by Modular Evolution of Sonic hedgehog and HOXD Enhancers"", biologists Francisca Leal and Marty Cohn study the embryology and genetics of snake limb development, nicely summarized in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R928fGoiZQE). What they found is nothing more than evolution before our own eyes.

Legless lizard species already are observed [to develop rudimentary limbs during early embryonic gestation](https://evolutionforskeptics.wordpress.com/2015/10/23/ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny-legless-lizard-embryos-have-hind-limb-buds/). 

Leal and Cohn tracked the genetic activity in embryonic pythons to see why their legs start, but never finish, developing. In all tetrapods the outgrow of limbs is ruled by the activity of a gene named Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). This gene is switched on and off by an enhancer, called ZRS. With modern techniques it's possible to highlight cells in an embryo that are active in any stage of embryonic gestation. This way can observe genes switching on and off by the affected cell groups signaling or petering out again. In the python embryos they studied, they literally observed the Sonic Hedgehog gene flickering on very briefly in python embryos less than 24 hours long. In [this video fragment](https://youtu.be/OMKRNhl8s0c?t=1m50s) this is nicely demonstrated.

Leal and Cohn found that it was not the Sonic Hedgehog gene that was affected by mutations [but the ZRS](https://youtu.be/OMKRNhl8s0c?t=1m20s). These mutations hindered the ZRS to maintain SHH activity. They also found that the whole genetic machinery, in tetrapods responsible for the outgrow of hind limbs (SHH, ZRS, Hand2, HOXD13, HOXA13 and others), is still sitting in the python's genome. Also the onset of hind limb outgrow occurs, like the forming of the ZPA and AER zones (the first 2 structures that subsequently differentiate the different limb parts), only to be arrested later. Only three mutations on the ZRS sequence impairs the decent outgrow of hind limbs.

Leal and Cohn also analyzed these three deleted sites on ZRS biochemically and they found that these indeed were binding sites for Hox proteins. Next they asked themselves whether the impaired ZRS sites indeed were responsible for dysfunctionality in hind limb outgrowth by substituting the native ZRS in mouse embryos by the ZRS of pythons as well as anole lizards as control group. [They found](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=3m16s) that the mouse embryos grew perfectly well developed hind limbs when their ZRS was substituted by anole lizard ZRS but were malformed - resulting in only some tiny buds - when substituted by python ZRS.

But they also found two other remarkable things after further investigation: the HOXA13 and HOXB13 genes in pythons are particularly well conserved. These genes are responsible for [the outgrowth of the distal parts of the hind leg](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=3m58s): the feet and toes. The HOXA13 and HOXB13 activity in python embryos leads to the premature but basic formation of the autopod region (everything from the ankle to the toes and in between). Which is quite remarkable when the animal doesn't grow legs in the first place. That's like starting to build an attic and roof while forgetting the ground floor and basement of a house.

The second remarkable discovery was that in python embryos in early stages of gestation, cartilage begins to condensate in a fashion where [you can clearly observe the contours of the femur, fibula, tibia and autopod being formed](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=5m6s). These cartilage structures don't persist in further embryonic gestation but clearly shows how far pythons progress in embryonic hind limb development.

In snakes that do not have any limbs left, also not the vestiges species like boas and pythons still have, the ZRS is much more heavily mutated, often almost close to entire randomization.

Now the burning question here of course is: what is a legless animal doing with an almost intact genetic substrate for growing hind legs in the first place?

Wasting away!

444,Creationists poor understanding of anatomy and other nonsense,19,True,"First time redditor and a layman who studies zoology and biology as a hobby.  I'm new to the format and typing on my phone so forgive me if it all looks awful.
In this thread: 

Almost all of it starts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6fpjr7/comment/dio3lye

/u/4chantothemax posted several inaccurate statements regarding Archaeopteryx.

1. Archaeopteryx did not have perching feet: 
http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1201_051201_archaeopteryx_2.html

2: it's skeletal structure is very, very different from a modem bird.
 
3. Equating emus (genus Dromiaus) with ostriches (genus struthio) and arguing that both have similar wing anatomy.

It strikes me that creationists have poor understanding of animal anatomy and it's functions. They also never seem to address sexual selection or attempt to explain it. It's quite frustrating when a layman like myself can research this stuff and they simply don't seem to bother. They don't understand simple paleontology and skeletons at all by appearances!

Also, I would have loved to see an answer to the refutations of the Flood. I really would love an explanation for how whales out flew/swam pterosaurs. The mental image of hovering whales flitting about like hummingbirds with their flippers will keep me in stitches for some time.

446,Question: timeline of evolution of organisms,3,True,"I've found charts and timelines that [look similar](http://erraticwisdom.com/assets/images/content/197.png) to the one below. I assume that it is basically correct. 

Time Frame:

    ~~Origin of the Earth	5 billion years~~ (not germane to evolution of phyla)
    ~~Bacteria and algae		3 billion years~~ (we're not discussing abiogenesis here)
    Filamentous algae		2 billion years
    Marine invertebrates	600 million
    Fish, land plants		400 million
    Amphibians			300 million
    Dinosaurs			200 million
    Mammals			150 million
    Primates			20 million

The problem is that the more complicated species became, the less time it took to evolve. Wouldn't the logical thing be that more complicated things take MORE time to evolve? Also, once you hit large organisms such as amphibians, reptiles, etc, the reproductive time is so long that there wouldn't have been enough generations to do all of this evolving. 

How do you guys understand this and explain it? Is there anything more of an explanation than something like this: *""Wow, it was really hard to get all of the building blocks correct to go from a prokaryote to a eukaryote. The rest of the evolution was dead easy""* ?

447,What this sub is good for and not good for (IMO).,0,True,"Hello /u/Rayalot72 , /u/DarwinZDF42 and others,

Well, I said that I would get back and comment here (videlicet https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6i9qzn/creationist_claim_there_is_no_proof_that_random/dj4v0yk/) and I've been thinking ...

I don't think that /r/debateEvolution is actually useful for debating. People say that ""the best predictor of future performance is past performance"", and ""those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it"". Every argument I make is basically answered with ""That's An Argument From Ignorance"" - an accusation that I categorically reject, but see no point in discussing further. It is so false and unwarranted that, sometimes I go crazy and overreact (link above). Occasionally there's also  the ""god of the gaps"" accusation thrown in too, but I see that accusation as being far more applicable to evolution than to intelligent design.  I'm just tired of going around in circles and getting nowhere so I'm not going to engage here anymore. I do realize that Reddit is not always the best place to have discussions and that maybe a discussion with some of you would be more productive in person at a cafe somewhere.

The only way that this subreddit serves any purpose for me is that I can ask questions about evolution and someone will normally answer them. The high point of my interactions here (so far) was the discussion that led to us understanding how a single loop circulatory system (2 chambered fish heart) could topologically be modified step by step into a double loop circulatory system (3 chambered amphibian heart). (And no, while I am tickled pink that this is possible when I had thought that there was no way that it could ever happen, I don't actually think that it happened that way.)  I'll post questions periodically when I want to understand how you see things. 

I have a suggestion for you (plural). Why don't you spend a month thinking that evolution cannot be correct and that the ubiquitous appearance of design in nature is in fact what Occam's razor would suggest: that nature has indeed been designed by some intelligent being (higher than humans). If a month is too long, try a week.  Why not spend this time trying to find problems, errors and flaws in evolution? They are in fact there (just as there are flaws in ID and possibly even more in the subset of ID called creationism).  It seems evident that most of you cannot see these flaws given the way that you currently approach things. Or maybe not. There are a number of evolutionists who are looking at these problems and trying to come up with ways to salvage the theory and maybe you are following along with them.

Thanks.

451,Why the fossil record is evidence for evolution.,18,True,"A couple of weeks ago there was [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6fpjr7/creationist_claim_evolutionary_theory_is_not/) where /u/4chantothemax challenged everyone to present evidence for evolution, to which I presented the general order of the fossil record. There was a lot of good discussion in that thread, that was unfortunately cut off. I'd like to present the conclusions from that discussion, and give the users here a chance to discuss something that isn't nitpicking about molecular biology terminology.

**Summary of the argument:**

The fossil record is, in my opinion, the best piece of evidence for evolution. It's simple to understand, and as far as I've seen, there is no way to explain it besides evolution. It's pretty hard to deny that fossil record shows a progression of life. Fish appear before amphibians, then reptiles, then mammal like reptiles, then mammals. Dinosaurs appear before birds, land mammals appear before aquatic mammals, lemurs appear before humans. Every organism fits neatly into its era, exactly the way evolution says it would.

**Minor counter arguments:**

There were some basic counter arguments that I will address briefly. Most of these were pretty quick to refute, and were not considered complete explanations.

The dating methods are wrong: Even if the dating methods were wrong, why would the wrong dates still match up to evolution? Surely inaccurate dating methods would lead to a random fossil order.

The fossil order matches the days of genesis: No it doesn't. Genesis says trees came before all animals, and birds before land animals. This isn't what the fossil record shows us.

If an out of place fossil were found, evolutionists would just say everything evolved in a different order: Fossil order could be changed, but very sparingly. If we had to reorder the fossil record so, for example, humans lived alongside dinosaurs, it would look very bad for evolution. We would have to explain why there is a 65 million year gap in the fossil record and why all the hominid ancestors appear after humans. Thankfully such things have never been found.

**The main counter argument, the great flood:**

/u/4chantothemax seemed to settle on the great flood explaining the fossil record. According to conventional creationist flood geology, the great flood ordered the fossil record by the following mechanisms:

Speed: Fast animals could escape the floodwaters better, so the slower amphibians and arthropods were buried first.

Intelligence: Humans and mammals could figure out ways to escape the floodwaters better than reptiles, so they were buried last.

Flight: Birds could fly away from the floodwaters, that's why they're at the top.

Density: Arthropods sunk to the bottom because they're heavy, and light birds floated to the top.

Altitude: Animals bellow sea level were buried first, which is why the bottom of the fossil record is aquatic.

So in short, we would expect to see smart, fast, light land animals at the top of the fossil record, and slow, stupid, heavy aquatic animals at the bottom. But, as most of us already know, that's not how the fossil record is ordered.

First of all, it's based on a lot of unfounded assumptions. Though mammals and birds are smarter than reptiles, why would that intelligence help them escape floodwaters better? How could floodwaters be powerful enough to carry all that sediment, but slow enough to let animals escape? Why would being submerged in floodwaters first also mean getting buried first? Wouldn't the sediment only settle when the floodwaters have settled?

But even if we take all those assumptions as true, it still doesn't work. The fossil record is full of things that contradict the great flood's fossil ordering. Such as...

Slow animals higher than fast animals: Sloths and sauropods higher than velociraptors.

Stupid animals higher than smart animals: Mesozoic mammals lower than cenozoic reptiles.

Flying animals lower than non-flying: Pterosaurs and cretaceous birds lower than elephants.

Heavy animals higher than light animals: Heavy armoured ankylosaurs higher than buoyant ammonites.

Land animals lower than aquatic animals: Whales above all dinosaurs.

Some examples contradict every single one of them. Turtles are slow, heavy, aquatic reptiles, yet they appear at the top of the fossil record.

Not to mention it assumes that every single individual had the ability to escape the floodwaters. No individuals of the more recent species could be sick, injured, old, disabled, or dead.

**Conclusion**

In light of conforming to evolution's predictions, and the complete failure of any attempt to explain it without evolution, the fossil record is damn good evidence for evolution.",1498205480,18,2017-06-23 04:11:20
452,"Response to Sal, on nylonase, again!",20,True,"Sal made [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6ia9h9/guyinachair_accused_me_of_lying_about_nylonase_so/) thread on /r/creation responding my claim that he's lying. So let's go!

> I've been officially accused by GuyInAChair of lying right here:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6hw0y7/biological_information_and_intelligent_design_new/dj48li4/

>I made the claim that there are more than 3000 entries in the Uniprot database for nylonases

Which is a lie. Or more accurately its a factually incorrect statement you continue to make after being corrected several times, which makes it a lie.

What you are doing is doing a name search in a database for a simple 6 carbon molecule, getting 3000+ results, and then equating those genes with the nylon digesting genes because they share similarities in nomenclature. They are not reacting with the same chemical! 

>because nylonases don't actually digest a fully formed nylon but rather a waste products or intermediates of the nylon manufacturing process, namely **dimer** and **oligomer** 6-aminohexanoates

Bold mine. Because understanding these two terms are key to understanding where Sal goes wrong. For a more complex definition of the terms check out the wikie pages. Here is a [polymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer). Here is a [oligomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer) and here is a [dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry))

On first glance it would seem that all three terms are explaining the roughly the same thing, and that's largely correct. The nylon-6 product that is digested by bacteria is in fact both a dimer, and a oligomer, and the nylon-6 oligomer is a nylon-6 polymer breakdown product. Confused? Well the important thing to remember is that they are all long chain macromolucules with a 6 carbon backbone.

Which is where the confusion comes in, because the 6 carbon backbone, or subunit is called [6-aminohexanoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminocaproic_acid) which is a really simple molecule, in fact its almost identical to the amino acid [Lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine)

This is important to remember 6-aminohexanoic acid by it's self **isn't** a dimer, or an oligomer. So lets look at Sal's next point.

>So what does Nylb actually ""digest""? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-aminohexanoate-dimer_hydrolase

>>6-Aminohexanoic Acid Cyclic **Dimer** Hydrolase

Bold mine!!! Sal these are not the same chemical. This is freshman chem stuff here.

>Ahem, so where again is the molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digested? The molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digest is:

>https://biocyc.org/compound?orgid=META&id=CPD-3923

>Does the molecule GuyInAChair claims is digested by NylB the molecule that NylB actually digests in the papers that reported on NylB? 

I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Obviously yes.

The gene is named ""6-aminohexanoate-**dimer** hydrolase"" because it's a long chain carbon based macromolucule and 6-aminohexanoate is the subunit. 

>So let's just settle this with facts rather than accusations of blatant lying on my part. If I made a mistake, I made a mistake, and I'd rather retract a mistake than mislead my fellow creationists.

It's an easy fact to show, it's right there in the damn name of the gene, and the chemical you copy pasted several times ""6-aminohexanoate-**dimer** hydrolase"" (there's also a cyclic version NylC?) This is simple stuff to understand with a freshman course in chemistry, and so simple that after a few beers I still feel qualified to explain it to you. 

The thing is I didn't start to call you a liar until you made this mistake serveral times, had it pointed out to you several times, and still continued to state the same incorrect thing asserted as though it was a fact. I conclude you knew this to be incorrect because you responded to the comments pointing this out, and since you made those comments knowing they were incorrect I'm calling you a liar.

>False, A-NylB in Agromyces and NylB in Flavobacteria have 99% sequence similarity and they will come up in the search on 6-aminohexanoate hydrolases Uniprot.

Come on Sal. Those two bacteria are from the same damn waste water pond. They are literally touching each other. So I guess you caught me... I should have said there`s not a single other gene that has a similar sequence except one other... that lives in the same damn nylon-factory-tailing-pond. Com'on

>So the enzyme doesn't digest nylon-6 but rather a waste product of its production. Yet I'm still accused of lying. GuyInAChair is welcome to offer a scientific counter to what I have presented.

You are lying. The waster water product is this [THIS](https://biocyc.org/compound?orgid=META&id=CPD-3923) taken from [THIS](https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P621-PWY) source. [THIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminocaproic_acid) is 6-aminohexanoic acid which is a subunit. 

Given the similarities in names this is certainly a forgivable mistake. Given you've been corrected on this mistake a half dozen times, and still hold to the incorrect claim dispite all the information needed to show it false having been available to you, makes you a liar.

The only reason that this latter example does not strain your credulity as it should, is because you've grown up hearing this fairy tale and it's become part of your belief system.

 

I'm going to hone in on this specific claim: 

> There is no proof that random mutations + natural selection in a lizard will ever ever result in it growing feathers

 

That's laughably false. We actually know *the exact steps* that result in feathers developing rather than scales. They come from the same structure developmentally.

How would these changes happen? Random mutations (probably in regulatory regions), preserved by natural selection. 

([Here's another source,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386666/) if anyone wants one.)

 

The rest of the initial claim? Wings just involve the fusion and/or elongation of different limb segments (plus grow feathers instead of scales). This really isn't hard.

456,Are these RNA molecules self-replicating?,3,True,"Regarding [this article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090109173205.htm), I came across the following response:  

""I arrive at my conclusion that there is no real evidence Evolution in large part by reading articles like this one. It uses deceptive semantics to mislead the reader about what the scientists actually created.

If you read and understand their description of the process, you see that their molecules are in fact *not* self-replicating. They are *self-assembling*, which is really a very different thing:

""Lincoln synthesized in the laboratory a large population of variants of the RNA enzyme that would be challenged to do the job, and carried out a test-tube evolution procedure to obtain those variants that were most adept at joining together pieces of RNA. [...] The replicating system actually involves two enzymes, each composed of two subunits and each functioning as a catalyst that assembles the other.""

So what you have here is *not* a molecule that makes copies of itself. When you have is four molecules which undergo a chain reaction that gradually combines all of them into two products.

It's cool chemistry that might have technological implications, but it is *not* a self-replicating molecule, and it is certainly not ""knocking on the door of life.""""

462,Dinosaur soft tissue - a nightmare for creationists,23,True,"As we all know, Mary Schweitzer has extracted collagen from dinosaur bone fossils.

The Tyrannosaur rex specimen MOR 1125 Schweitzer used for her research, was excavated from the Hell Creek formation, Montana, USA. The Hell Creek site has been very extensively and frequently been dated, [applying several different and distinct techniques](http://www.academia.edu/23452449/Magnetostratigraphy_and_geochronology_of_the_Hell_Creek_and_basal_Fort_Union_Formations_of_southwestern_North_Dakota_and_a_recalibration_of_the_age_of_the_Cretaceous-Tertiary_boundary). These measurements all yield concordant results. The particular strata where specimen MOR 1125 was found is also very near the K/Pg boundary. The K/Pg boundary is among the most frequent dated geological stratum, on very different locations worldwide.

Applying different and independent dating techniques simultaneously on the very same specimens and yield concordant ages, is called calibration. The odds of such concordant results occuring by random change is nihil, ***ESPECIALLY*** when one or more of those techniques were invalid, as creationists claim. This already works with two simultaneously applied techniques but the calibration validation will be ever stronger when combining 3, 4 or even more techniques.

When calibration yields concordant results, it's basically ""game over"".

There are very interesting results of the Schweitzer research that didn't catch the attention they deserve. These constiture a nightmare for creationists.

Evolution theory says that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The anatomy of extant birds already clearly relate them to reptiles rather than, for instance, to mammals, and the fossil record sufficiently demonstrates the dinosaur > bird transition. 

But molecular evidence would be welcome.

Proteins are redundant. This means that the actual functional parts often only constitute a rather small proportion of the total molecule. Also the folding of the protein is of great importance, so any change of the protein that does not affect the folding or the functional part, do not matter. For instance, it has been shown that the human cytochrome c protein works in yeast (a unicellular organism) that has had its own native cytochrome c gene deleted, even though yeast cytochrome c differs from human cytochrome c over 40% of the protein. In fact, the cytochrome c genes from tuna (fish), pigeon (bird), horse (mammal), Drosophila fly (insect), and rat (mammal) all function in yeast that lack their own native yeast cytochrome c. Yet, cytochrome c is most essential for life. Removing it will cause instant cell death.

Consequently, proteins vary in their biochemical make-up among species. Closely related species show less differences in the biochemical make-up of their proteins than compared to more distant species. That makes them suitable for establishing phylogenetic relationships.

Collagen is no exception.

And since we have the collagen of Tyrannosaur specimens, we might as well use them to find out which species to be the closest relatives of Tyrannosaurs. This is called amino acid sequencing. Another, different approach is conducting antibody tests.

Schweitzer also found this to be an intriguing idea and compared the collagen she found in MOR 1125 with samples she retrieved from, respectively, newts (amphibian), frogs (amphibian), chickens (bird) and a mastodont (extinct, ~400,000 years old mammal). 

What is the prediction biology makes about the phylogeny of birds? That birds evolved from dinosaurs (more preciese: birds and dinosaurs form a clade).

And what did Schweitzer find? Of all collagen specimens she analysed, the ones from chickens resemble those of T. rex most. This was affirmed by antibody testing. Later research, applying amino acid sequencing in comparing protein specimens retrieved from hadrosaur fossils, also firmly confirmed dinosaurs to be most closely related to birds.

466,Creationist Claim: Evolutionary Theory is Not Falsifiable,18,True,"If there was no mechanism of inheritance...

If survival and reproduction was completely random...

If there was no mechanism for high-fidelity DNA replication...

If the fossil record was unordered...

If there was no association between genotype and phenotype...

If biodiversity is and has always been stable...

If DNA sequences could not change...

If every population was always at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium...

If there was no medium for storing genetic information...

If adaptations did not improve fitness...

If different organisms used completely different genetic codes...

 

...then evolutionary theory would be falsified.

 

""But wait,"" you say, ""these are all absurd. Of course there's inheritance. Of course there's mutation."" 

To which I reply, exactly.

Every biological inquiry since the mid 1800s has been a test of evolutionary theory. If Mendel had shown there was no mechanism of inheritance, it's false. If Messelson and Stahl had shown there was no mechanism for copying DNA accurately, it's false. If we couldn't show that genes determine phenotypes, or that allele frequencies change over generations, or that the species composition of the planet has changed over time, it's false. 

Being *falsifiable* is not the same thing as being *falsified*. Evolutionary theory has passed every test. 

 

""But this is really weak evidence for evolutionary theory.""

I'd go even further and say none of this is necessarily evidence *for* evolutionary theory at all. These tests - the discovery of DNA replication, for example, just mean that we can't reject evolutionary theory on those grounds. That's it. Once you go down a list of reasons to reject a theory, and none of them check out, in total that's a good reason to think the theory is accurate. But each individual result on its own is just something we reject as a refutation. 

If you want evidence *for* evolution, we can talk about how this or that mechanism as been demonstrated and/or observed, and what specific features have evolved via those processes. But that's a different discussion.

 

""Evolutionary theory will just change to incorporate findings that contradict it.""

To some degree, yes. That's what science does. When part of an idea doesn't do a good job explaining or describing natural phenomena, you change it. So, for example, if we found fossils of truly multicellular prokaryotes dating from 2.8 billion years ago, that would be discordant with our present understanding of how and when different traits and types of life evolved, and we'd have to revise our conclusions in that regard. But it wouldn't mean evolution hasn't happened. 

On the other hand, if we discovered *many* fossil deposits from around the world, all dating to 2.8 billion years ago and containing chordates, flowering plants, arthropods, and fungi, we'd have to seriously reconsider how present biodiversity came to be.

> I'm a Young Earth Creationist, and quite frankly, **I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to study science from an evolutionary standpoint as I don't believe it**,

Yes, you don't want to learn what 99% of biologists consider the cornerstone of biology because you don't want it. Great.


>and I think I'd find it incredibly boring.

Evolutionary biology could literally fill weeks of reading and learning.

> So, I'd rather study science

""science""

> from a creationist standpoint **because I know that I'll thoroughly enjoy it, and I won't be wasting my time.**

Translation: I don't believe A therefore I want to read about B (because I already accept it) so I think I will enjoy confirming my views and I enjoy that.

This is just to illustrate that creationists don't need to be understood on a deep level. They will say it into your face: They know what the want to believe, and their are going to do exactly that. Period.

The user /u/Madmonk11 in /r/Creation writes his own [essay](https://houseofadesertvoice.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/the-remnant.pdf) about:

> Linking Evolution and Humanity's Mass Delusion to God's Purpose and the Problem of Evil

Now let's look at the most important parts of the essay:


> Now, in our world, we have been gaining more and more knowledge. Yet, we have not been informed by perfect omniscience, fully anyway, and in general, we are not compliant with what instructions we receive. The more knowledge we receive, we find ourselves continually with unknowns. We make assumptions. We rely on the assumptions of others. as a collective, we become comforted by our increasing repertoire of observations mixed with suppositions and theories, and our worldview becomes more and more solid.

So basically, yes we get it. Science builds on the discovery of others. But sure, the more scientists build on top of each other, the more..... assumptions we do? What's the implication here? Only a fool would spin this in a bad light. This person has 0% knowledge of how science works as we can see in the next paragraphs.


> Yet, a certain rare few of us, those of us who actually are receiving input from God, are noticing that our evermore detailed worldview is just solidifying in its incorrectness.

Ah yes, the creationist, who is always just one button away from God's Skype calls (only him and a couple of others have his contact address), watches over the earth and all of the scientists doing work that is *just* incorrect. Brilliant.


> Pretty much everyone will acknowledge the phenomenon in Nazi Germany. Achaeologists and anthropologists from Nazi europe scoured he world collecting evidence that white Europeans were descended from a nordic master race from the North Pole that has been in a forever war with the Jews, the root of all evil. The society as a whole became convinced of this, and it took losing a war to shake the view.

Holy trivialization. The nazi regime spawned a lot of unscientific research. That is true. The true reason for this was that the fascist regime relied more on politics and propaganda then on actual science. The whole notion that we could actually classify people into ""jewish"" or ""non-jewish"" or ""negroid"" etc. was completely unscientific from a modern-day perspective. There's not a single truth in it, genetically speaking. But the nazi regime, in control of pretty much every social outlet (news, faculties, books), practically *pushed* people into accepting this as a fact.

So basically, a fascist regime with almost complete control to information and education formed a whole generation of very very bad (and dangerous) science.

> and it took losing a war to shake the view.

Yes, true. Fascism had to be bashed before people came to their senses again. Are you implying the same kind of obstructionist, totalitarian propaganda is going on today again? Let's see what the author says:



> Likewise, scientists from all over look into various collections of fossils, molecules, genes, and whatever they can find to come up with the view that we evolved from animals, that our universe is a random accident, etc. The more we observe, the more we fit into this supposition, this collectively dreamed up, yet totally inaccurate and logically impossible scenario. At the end of days, humanity will never be more convinced of its view of itself, and humanity will never be more wrong. We are making the puzzle fit our preconceptions derived from limited knowledge.

Rambling. Not even an argument and a complete non-sequitur. I don't think I could find a better paragraph perfectly describing the word **whining** better than here. No arguments brought forward, other than ""wah wah scientists are coming to conclusions that are just *wrong* because the scientists are building up their science on what other scientists have researched"" because for some reason this individual does not seem to be able to word out why this is a wrong method.

> this collectively dreamed up, yet totally inaccurate and logically impossible scenario.

Dreamed up? Seriously? Totally inaccurate? Any reasons why? Logically impossible? According to ignorant creationists like you? Where are your arguments. Oh wait, this is just an essay to jerk yourself off not to provide any reasonable insights.


Anyways, let's top this off with something even more ridiculous.

Climate change denial:



>It’s actually ironic that I am writing this on the day that the US President has withdrawn from the Paris environmental agreement. The news is ablaze with scientists screaming about environmental catastrophe.

Haha silly experts am I right?

> While there are many small theories contributing to the whole of the climate change movement, ultimately, the movement propounds the notion that the earth is heating up, that this will melt the world’s ice, and the earth will be flooded. The primary catastrophe that threatens the earth is global flooding.




> **I can’t help but laugh with a wince.**

What the fuck kind of argument is that? LMAO silly scientists and their facts haha I sure have to laugh because I don't buy it.

Oh wait OP does seem to have an argument:


> The bible predicts a great many ecological catastrophes in our future. Plagues the likes of which we have not yet seen are predicted. a huge amount of aquatic life is to be destroyed. The sky will be darkened. Stars will actually fall. Asteroids perhaps? Who knows. Trees burned, land scorched. It’s all there. Exxon Mobil will probably not be the cause of all this stuff. Biological weapons the likes of the various zombie apocalypse movies? Maybe? Yet, the bible tells us that
the world has already been flooded, and there isn’t going to be another flood. According to the bible, there is really only ONE ecological disaster that we don’t have to worry about, yet that one is precisely what the population of the earth is so convinced is going to happen, and so violently insists can only be averted with just the right corporate tax scheme.

Tl;DR: Climate change is not real because the bible already predicted the flood and only **one** flood. Therefore, a second ""flood"" will not happen. Therefore, climate change is not real.


So after reading the most ridiculous argument I have ever laid my eyes on, the smugness continues:

> Only a very few people will realize that humanity just doesn’t have the knowledge to be right about everything without divine help. And only these same few will watch with their eyes open as all the scientists and politicians hold hands and pronounce statements about the nature of existence that are completely wrong. 

Again no arguments to be seen. Just OP tapping himself on the shoulder that everything those smart scientists and politicians say are completely wrong because they aren't in direct phone-contact to god.


> They will be called deniers by a population that cannot comprehend that all the people who have been to our schools, who we call smart, could all be absolutely wrong.


Yes. People who go to school, study different subjects, get a degree in a relevant field, *could* all be absolutely wrong. What's the point? Ah yes I forgot, the point here is OP just knows better...... So where's the debunking of the denial part?

As if this wasn't enough shoulder patting, it just keeps on getting more ridiculous:


> So here I am not talking about the faithful Remnant as those with discipline to stay the course, but that the faithful Remnant are those (same people) who see our flawed and finite race going off the tracks.

Again, something something we're just humans therefore I see over the world and all is flawed.


> The more ‘knowledge’ our society amasses, the more this remnant will be called deniers of the patently obvious.

This guy's head could not be more up his own booty. Yes, the more we learn, the more it seems like we are diverting from the ""remnant"" a.k.a. that book written by goat herders is getting more and more inaccurate.

I can't even comprehend how any brain would think this sentence is okay. The more ""knowledge"" we ""gather"" the ""wronger"" we actually get. Yeah okay buddy. Not even wrong.



 


> In the end, though, we will be the only ones who are correct.

""OP excitedly proceeds to stroke his penis.""



>As every human leaves their mortal coil and meets the truth, they will be utterly shocked to learn that all of their scholars and academics and founts of knowledge were wrong about the very basics about where we came from and where we are.

""OP finishes at the thought that all of those millions of smart people were actually wrong and only he, the non-scholar, was right all along (because he says so)""




> And this will demonstrate just one of the many things that God is trying to teach us with this fallen world: without him, we will fall into delusion, and the only way to avoid this is to believe what he tells us.

473,Quick question about the Origin of Life and minimum complexity,9,True,"So I had a conversation about the origin of life (Abiogenesis etc.) but since I'm not knowledgeable myself I gave [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ssv4s/abiogenesis_hypothesis_and_evidence_of/?ref=search_posts) as a starting point:

Anyways I got this response:

___

> No self replicators exist between the complexity of a simple crystal-like structure and the simplest autotrophs with around 1 million base pair genomes, despite millions of viruses and other parasites existing along this range. Not a single one. If simpler self-replication were possible we should see them in vivo.

> I'm not saying we should specifically see RNA-only replicators, but any replicators simpler than 1MB genome cells. There are RNA and DNA viruses with around 3KB genomes and they get along fine without being gobbled up by other cells.

> I've seen others discuss minimum complexity as a problem:

> * SETI researcher Paul Davies: ""The underlying problem is complexity. Even the simplest bacterium is, at the molecular level, staggeringly complex. Although we have no idea of the minimal complexity of a living organism, it is likely to be very high. It could be that some sort of complexifying principle operates in nature, serving to drive a chaotic mix of chemicals on a fast track to a primitive microbe. If so, no hint of such a principle has been found in laboratory experiments to re-create the basic building blocks of life.""


> * Origin of life researcher Stuart Kauffman: ""Of all the problems with the hypothesis that life started as nude replicating RNA molecules, the one I find most insurmountable is the one most rarely talked about: all living things seem to have a minimal complexity below which it is impossible to go""

> * Eugene Koonin: ""Given the intricacy of the molecular machinery of even the simplest cells, the lack of any observations on cell origin, except from other cells, and the lack of any apparent intermediate stages in the evolution of cells, the origin of cells engenders the ominous specter of irreducible complexity""


___

My questions to you are:

1. What do you think of the list itself?

2. How significant is this problem of minimum complexity?

3. What do you think of the 3 listed quotes?

3. What do you think of this statement (taken from above):

> If simpler self-replication were possible we should see them in vivo.

My response was this:

> Why should we? On earth, a lot of animals do not currently life on the whole spectrum of complexity. There are jumps everywhere because a lot of animals died out. We don't see any dinosaurs or mega-sharks today but they did exist and nobody is expecting that we ""should"" see them in vivo today. They simply died out, together with the RNA world and 99.99% of all life that ever lived on this planet which died out. Also, we ""shouldn't"" see self-replicators in real life nowadays because of obvious reasons. Apparently, RNA replicators can't survive in an oxygen-rich world which means any sign of them were destroyed as soon as autotrophes took over this beautiful world and secondly, self-replicating RNA is delicious food for any bacteria. I don't think any biologist would agree that we should expect to see them. RNA enzymes are a cool way to understand early life on a young earth, but those replicators aren't good survivors compared to todays animals. This is also why scientists have to make these RNA experiments in sterile environments to simulate early-earth (Early earth= zero bacteria or viruses that could harm RNA), whereas today's earth is not sterile in any way.

The main evidence for evolution, from what I have read, is the genetic similarities between organisms. There's no reason why creatures couldn't have been created with these genetic similarities. After all, Gods creation is physically perfect relative to its purpose [1], and using different genetics for the same purpose implies that one is superior to the other [2].
[1] As in, it is not within our purpose to fly (for example), which is why we don't have wings. Our lack of wings doesn't mean we're physically imperfect compared to birds, for example, though, since God designed birds to fly, but did not design humans to fly.
[2] If I made an old program with code that is similar to a newer program that has the same function, then I should be able to copy and paste the old code into the new program if the old code is well-written, so there is a similarity between both programs. The same way older organisms have similarities with new organisms. If the old code wasn't well-written, though, then I'd need to rewrite that function again (so there is no similarity between both organisms).

477,Creationist Claim: Convergent evolution is a problem for evolutionary theory,19,True,"Yes, [creationists are claiming that convergent evolution is a problem. 
](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6dunoi/the_real_problem_with_convergence_evolution_news/)
Convergent evolution is when different organisms develop similar adaptations to similar environments or ecological niches. For example, sharks and dolphins have similar shaped bodies. 

 

Living in the same environment, selection favors the same general set of morphological adaptations. So you end up with different organisms that look similar. 

 

[In the linked piece](https://www.evolutionnews.org/2017/05/the-real-problem-with-convergence/) (from Discovery Institute, of course), the author claims that this is a problem for evolutionary theory for two reasons: It's unlikely (I'm going to ignore this, because *yawn* big scary numbers), and it violates ""the evolutionary pattern"" that more closely related species ""share similarities with each other much more consistently than with species on other branches"" that is followed ""with great precision.""

 

Except the author, Cornelius Hunter, applies this logic to *morphological* rather than genetic traits. And we do phylogenetics with genetics if at all possible, because it's more reliable than morphology. We've [experimentally verified](http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol445D_W00/exp_phylo.pdf) phylogenetic techniques *independent of morphology*. And we do have to account for convergence in these techniques, which we've gotten *really* good at. 

 

So this whole argument rests on misleading the reader about how biologists generate phylogenies. (Yes, there are obviously phylogenies that consider morphological data, mostly having to do with extinct species where genetics isn't an option, but this piece deals with extant organisms, so that excuse isn't available.)

The crux of the argument is that nylonase, the enzyme the degrades nylon, a synthetic fabric, didn't actually evolve, because it's a modified form of a preexisting enzyme. 

This older enzyme had some limited ability to interact with nylon, and this modified version of the enzyme just does it *better*. But it's not *new* new. It's just adapted from the old enzyme.

 

Really. That's the argument *against* the evolution of nylonase.

 

This is called exaptation: When you have a feature that does one thing, but it is co-opted to do a different thing. Happens all. the. time. It's a major source of evolutionary novelty. Saying ""This gene isn't new at all! It evolved from this other gene!"" doesn't undermine evolutionary theory; it's another datum in support of it.

 

The authors go on to make this claims:
>The research underlines once again the very limited capacity of mutations and natural selection to create the complex features that characterize all living things

That's wrong. This shows that the evolution of novel traits isn't as hard as creationists think it is. This is one more study that shows how anytime you hear a ""it would take X mutations in Y amount of time, and that's just too improbable"" argument, think about how few changes are actually required for some major novel traits.

486,"Creationist Claim: ""mtEve dates to 6000 years ago."" This is completely wrong.",14,True,"No, mitochondrial Eve did not exist 6000 years ago. 

 

Here's the post, in full:
>Based on observed mtDNA mutation rates, mtEve dates to about 6000 years ago, contradicting the proposed timeline of the out-of-africa expansion. The 200ka date commonly cited comes from comparing human and chimp mitochondiral genomes, but this contradicts the observed rate and uses special pleading to assume a substitution rate 30 times slower than the mutation rate.

 

No. Here's how you figure out something like this.


 

First, you need to pick a region of the genome that accumulates substitutions (changes) at a relatively constant rate. This usually has to be a nonfunctional region - either intergenic (between genes) or a pseudogene (the nonfunctional remnants of a gene). This is important, because selection should not work to clear mutations in these regions, since such mutations should not affect fitness.

 

Second, what you care about is the *substitution* rate, **not** the *mutation* rate. The mutation rate is the rate at which changes occur. And change to the DNA is a mutation. Mutation rate is usually calculated as mutations/site/replication. The *substitution* rate is the rate at which mutations are fixed, meaning that everyone in the population has them, and is calculated as substitutions/site/year. Calculating the rate per year rather than per replication (i.e. per DNA copying) makes a big difference. 

So why do we use one but not the other?

 

It's really simple: Not all mutations get passed on to the next generation. Humans are multicellular. One of my skin cells could experience a mutation, but that mutation will never get passed on to my offspring. Only mutations that occur in germline tissue (cells that ultimately result in sperm or egg) *might* get passed on to offspring. The changes that get passed on and accumulate are substitutions, so we use that rate to determine the *time to most recent common ancestor* (TMRCA), the amount of time since two individuals/populations/species have diverged. 

 

The third step is to survey the genetic diversity of individuals, document the differences, and then using the substitution rate, work backwards to determine how long their lineages have been apart. And then do this again and again and again for lots of individuals to get a range of times. Very importantly, you have to do these calculations using the substitution rate, *not* the mutation rate. 

 

Here's an illustration of why this is important:

Say, for example, we have documented a mutation rate of 100 per generation, and a substitution rate of 2 per generation. (I'm just making up numbers and using the same units to keep it simple.) Now let's say we have two people, there are 1000 differences between them. If you used the mutation rate to calculate the TMRCA, you would say it would take **5 generations** to reach the 1000 differences (500 in one person, 500 in the other). But that assumes that every mutation that occurs gets passed on, which is completely unrealistic. In this example, it's only 2 per person that get passed on, so it would take at least **250 generations** to achieve the 1000 differences.

 

So when someone writes...
>The 200ka date commonly cited...contradicts the observed rate and uses special pleading to assume a substitution rate 30 times slower than the mutation rate.

...they are completely wrong. You *must* use the substitution rate to do calculations like this, and it *is* slower than the mutation rate. There's no special pleading here. 

 

I'm happy to go into this in more detail, but this error is sufficient to explain the different dates. Creationists are using the wrong metric to get a more recent date. It's that simple. ",1495457693,16,2017-05-22 08:54:53
487,Why the fossil evidence in Darwin's time suffices greatly as evidence for evolution,9,True,"The number of excavated and studied fossils in Darwin's time is only an extremely small fraction of the ones we know of today. Yet, the fossil record familiar for early 19th century palaeontologists and biologists *greatly suffices* as evidence for evolution.

Darwin dedicated no less than two chapters of his *Origin of species* to the fossil record. In chapter IX he deals with the ""imperfection of the geological record"" and mentions the gaps in the fossil record, the Cambrian radiation event, the intermittence of geological formations and other problems and tries to explain or solve them.

In chapter X though he elaborates on the things that actually were known in his time. And this evidence greatly suffices as evidence for evolution of life. What exactly was the state of affairs in geology and paleontology when Darwin embarked on the Beagle for his famous voyage to all corners of the planet?

In 19th century geology the notion already started to take shape that the earth must be very old. This was derived from the observation that the geological record consists of thousands of distinct layers with greatly differing composition in an, at first sight, random order of appearance. And when layers are of different composition, you justly might infer that they are of different origin. That is, each layer formed in its own way.

How do we know? Well, if you find a layer which is littered with marine fossils, you might expect it to be a former sea floor. Layers where one finds land animals must have been terrestrial. Layers of charcoal are fossilized forrests. Challk rocks consist of trillions of fossilized coccolithophores and other plankton fossils and thus must have been formed in a relatively shallow sea. Etc.

When you find thousands of intermittent layers of all types cumulated on the very same spot (also refered to as the 'geological column'), where dozens of former sea floors (limestone, chalk layers, sandstone with marine fossils) are alternated by former forrests (coal layer), former desert planes, former terrestrial planes, all *on the very same spot*, you know a lot of time must have passed by.

But EVEN when we ONLY conclude that deeper layers are older than the ones on top of those and disregard any implication that all combined must span a large amount of time, EVEN THEN we must conclude about the following *observations*:

1. the biodiversity of each geological formation differs greatly from any other one

2. each geological formation has a unique biodiversity. Some genera may overlap several geological formations but in each formation there are genera and even families of species that are entirely unique for that formation

3. genera come and go. For instance: in Cambrian layers you won't find land plants, jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals. Instead you will find trilobites and a bunch of other, often almost alien life forms. In the Crateceous we do find land plants, jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals. But most of the extravagant Cambrian life forms like trilobites went extinct. If we look around today, dinosaurs are gone and the birds and mammals are very different from their Crateceous relatives.

In other words, even when we refrain from any claim of an old earth, or even leave the question about the age of the earth unanswered, we *still* observe that life GREATLY changed over the geological eras.

Consequently, Darwin didn't start his inquiries on biodiversity by asking *if* there's evolution but *why*. He tried to explain what mechanisms could account for *the observed change in biodiversity*.

The observed geological stratification and biodiversity found in the fossil record though DO DISCARD *DIRECTLY*:

- the simultaneous creation of all species ever lived, extinct or extant, on earth

- the notion of a world wide flood

- for that matter, a young earth.

getting blood from a stone.

490,"Fazale Rana Uses Population Genetics to Argue for Literal Adam and Eve, Faceplants",13,True,"Sigh. I feel like they're just going through the motions. [Here's Fazale Rana arguing](http://www.reasons.org/blogs/the-cells-design/conservation-biology-studies-elicit-doubts-about-the-first-human-population-size) that Adam and Eve literally existed because you can't trust population genetics techniques that indicate humans never experienced a population bottleneck smaller than the tens of thousands. 

 

There's a lot of handwaving and the ""oh but we have to be *rigorous* in our methods"" double standard that you always get right before a false dichotomy of ""if we can't trust these finding, must be God!"" variety. 

But I want to focus on one very general thing, and one very specific thing. 

 

The general thing is that Rana claims that since we have examples of bottlenecks where genetic diversity has been retained, that invalidates the idea that high diversity implies the absence of a tight bottleneck. 

It's true that we have examples of bottlenecks with subsequently high genetic diversity. 

The reason for this is simple: Allele loss during a bottleneck is *random*. There's nothing about a bottleneck that forces alleles to be lost. It's just *more likely* the smaller the population gets. 

So we have examples where we see little loss of allelic diversity, and we have examples with a very sharp decline in diversity. (You'll notice that Rana mentions none of these. Northern elephant seals are my pet example.)

 

The specific thing is a study of white-tailed deer in Finland that Rana claims invalidates a specific method of measuring genetic diversity as a valid way to calculate past population size. 

Except it doesn't seem like Rana read the paper in question. 

He says:
>Though the researchers found that the genetic diversity of this population was lower than for a comparable population in Oklahoma (reflecting the genetic bottleneck that occurred when the original members of the population were relocated), it was still surprisingly high. Because of this unexpectedly high genetic diversity, size estimates for the initial population would be much greater than four individuals. To put it another way, this population size method fails validation—one more time.

 

Except the authors say this:
>In terms of classic population
genetic theory (eq. 1), this high level of retention of heterozygosity in a population presumably founded by four individuals is unexpected. Nevertheless, our individual-based simulation of population establishment where the genealogy of the males and females in the population are tracked allowed calculation of a predicted heterozygosity which closely matches the observed heterozygosity in the current Finnish white-tailed deer population.
Because the introduced white-tailed deer population enjoyed rapid initial population growth, it spent a relatively short time period at a small size, which has allowed the retention of relatively much genetic diversity.

 

In other words, using techniques that accurately model real populations, you get an accurate answer, and in this specific case, we know why: rapid reproduction and rapid population growth. 

 

Deer reproduce a heck of a lot faster than humans (they reach sexual maturity within two years and have one to two offspring per year for eight to ten years). So not only does this study explicitly *not* invalidate the technique Rana claims it does, it actually exhibits how we can optimize these techniques as we learn more. In other words, how science is self-improving, allowing use to learn more over time.

493,"That whale evolution video, debunked point by point.",19,True,"[Here's the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zio1ttlDjlM) This is promoted as a refutation of whale evolution. 

Here's why it's nonsense:

 

>“best fossil proof for theory of evolution”

It’s not “proof,” it’s just one more body of evidence

 

>Darwin thought…

Irrelevant

 

>scientists in one place say one thing, scientists in another place say a different thing

Scientists disagree! Stop the presses. Happens all the time. Doesn’t call into question the underlying theory.

 

>scientists can’t agree on which land animal changed into a whale

No. Not everyone agrees on what that ancient animal *looked like*. There isn’t really much dispute that hippos are the closest living relatives (i.e. share a more recent common ancestor than any other land mammal) of whales. 

 

>ambulocetus…thought by some to be a walking whale

That’s what the name means. It’s named that because it’s a closer relative to extant whales than any extant species (it’s closer than hippos), so it’s on the whale lineage, but it had legs and feet – it walked. Hence “walking whale.” 

 


>Duane Gish: “I don’t know why they could call that creature a whale…”

Fuck that guy. 

 

No, really. I'm not going to pretend Gish is anything more than a dishonest hack who made a career out of lying. Fuck that guy.

 

>ambulocetus might not be a direct ancestor!

Okay. Might be the case. Still represents something more adapted for water than hippos, and closer to extant whales than any living terrestrial mammal. 

Also, the rationale for this claim is the eyes high on the head, like alligators. You know what else has eyes high on the head? Hippos! It’s a useful trait if you live in shallow marshes or coastal regions! Less so once you live in deep water! Selection would favor this trait (i.e. individuals with “high eyes” would have higher fitness) during the transition, but not once they lived exclusively in open water. This. Isn’t. Hard. 

 

>No fossils of rhodocetus tail, therefore how do we know it looked like a whale?

First response: We also don’t have fossils of Lucy’s feet, but we know what shape they were based on her hips and femur. 

Second response: Okay, pretend the tail doesn’t exist. It still has features that indicate it’s more whale-like than ambulocetus, and temporally it existed closer to extant whales than ambulocetus. Which all means that rhodocetus represents an intermediate species between terrestrial mammals and extant whales. 

There’s also a cut in the video at this point, during Gingrich’s answer to this question (at 5:57 in the video), so I don’t take the presentation in the video at face value. I suspect there is a “but…” prior to the second half of that sentence that go spliced together. He goes on to say “with that said…” as the audio fades out. So I’m not taking the presentation in the video at face value. Show the full tape.

 

Wait hang on. At 6:54, there’s a picture of the fossil progression, with question marks or or X’s over most of them. When did we start disputing that ambulocetus existed? Did I miss that part? No, we’re just going from “but the eyes are located differently from modern whales” to “isn’t part of this lineage at all in any way.” That doesn’t seem reasonable. And they got rid of basilosaurus with no explanation, at all. Hasn’t even been mentioned. Just cross that one off with a big red X for no stated reason.

But at least they kept dorudon, which on its own is sufficient to make the point about whale evolution.

 

>changes due to accidental changes like mutations “are preposterous”

K. Except that’s how evolution works. The changes aren’t directed. They just happen. Lots of different mechanisms, but they’re all more or less “accidental.” You don't have to like it, but if you want to claim otherwise, we're going to need evidence of the mechanism that purposefully drives them.

 

Also, why do they keep bringing up hyenas? Nobody thinks whales came from something like hyenas. Some of the early members of the whale lineage (like *Indohyus*) may have *looked* like hyenas, but they aren’t very closely *related* to them. Again, hippos are the closest extant relatives. Whales are artiodactyls. Hyenas are in the cat branch of the carnivores. Did they have nobody on staff that could check this kind of stuff?

  

>For whales to evolve “too many body transitions would have to occur by chance.”

Asserted without evidence. 

 

>nostrils would have to move to top of head and form a blowhole

No mention of the robust fossil record documenting this change. 

 

>Hair would have to disappear and be replaced by blubber. 

Hair is outside the skin, blubber is a layer of fat below skin. The are two different things. Whale actually have hair in utero. Are these filmmakers even trying?

 

>Each new trait would require at least one new structural protein, which would require “at least 300 letters of DNA”

Asserted with out evidence. 

Also, 100 amino acids is a laughably small protein. Like, that’s a hormone, not a structural protein. Did nobody crack a biology textbook, or, like, peruse Wikipedia before writing this silliness? 

 

>dice analogy

Ignores selection, or presence of functional intermediates, or exaptation, or…

 

And…that’s it. That was a giant waste of time. There isn’t a single reasonable argument made in there, there is a TON of evidence omitted, and a bunch of statements that are completely false. Is this really the best the creationist-industrial complex can do?

First of all, /u/AlbanianDad miserably [fails to understand evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6banny/whale_evolution_vs_the_actual_fossil_evidence/dhmoz48/):

> What I also don't get is that mutations are supposed to be random. When they pick an animal to evolve into a whale (like a hyena) they show it as though evolution had a ""direction"" from land to water. Or a will. Or a conscious of some sort. Like it was ""trying"" to evolve into a whale.

Well, mutations are indeed found to be random in respect to their effects on fitness. But, no, we don't try to show as though evolution had a ""direction"" from land to water. Instead, evolution is natural selection acting upon genetic variance, only that genetic variance is due to genetic mutations. So evolution is not a random process in the end.

Therefore:

> ... why don't millions of animals across the globe grow dorsal fins randomly?

is *nonsense* because structures **DON'T** grow randomly.

> Where are all the remnants of hyenas (or whatever animal) left in whales?

No, because hyenas were not the species that are thought to be the ancestors of cetaceans. Hyenas belong to the order of carnivora. Cetaceans belong to the order of artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.

And we don't talk about ""remnants"" but shared traits.

Here are the ""remnants"" of even-toed ungulates in cetaceans:

- breathing with lungs like all land animals do and not with gills like most sea critters do

- cetaceans are placental mammals, milk feeding their young ones and giving live birth

- their skeleton in about all respects is typically amniotic and synapsid-like, unlike fish, which are anamniotic

- early cetaceans like Dorudon and Basilosaurs had anatomically intact hind limbs, attached to a pelvis. Only those hind limbs were far to small (about a housecat's size) for such rather large and long animals (Dorudon up to 2 tons). Moreover, the pelvis in both species was not attached to their spines. You can't walk with hind feet that are detached from the spine. One may ask what marine animals were doing with anatomically intact hind limbs in the first place

- cetaceans have anatomic features that are only found in artiodactyls and nowhere else in any other animal (ankle bone structure).

A whole lot don't you think? And not even closely a complete list.

Then we have /u/ThisBWhoIsMe with the usual tattle about ""the hidden secrets"" of ""Darwiniast failure"" being ""caught"":

> I liked the part where the Whale's Fluke turned out to be a fluke, Professor; ""I just speculated."" Also, the look on Doc's face, 5:38, when he got caught.

Maybe ThisBWhoIsMe could explain how an animal like [Dorudon](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDGwhales/PDGdorudonskel.jpg) could have propelled through the oceans???? With those tiny detached hind limbs? With its small front limbs? With only the long, lean tail its fossil remains are suggesting?

Now look at [the skeleton of modern sperm whale](https://readtiger.com/img/wkp/en/Sperm_whale_skeleton.jpg). See, no  fluke there as well. But about the same proportions of body volume to front limb size.

You know how modern sperm whale propel themselves: my means of fluke ondulation of the tail.

How do you think Dorudon propelled itself through the ocean water? I am wasting away your answer.

Right.

BTW, also observe the detached hind limbs in Dorudon ([in detail](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwjn1cTGuPnTAhXJ1hoKHeVPDnoQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Ftimevanson%2F7282107938&psig=AFQjCNGggpA1o0QOTMXtT_hWiNGrYSVK4w&ust=1495196875118079)) and the corresponding vestiges in sperm whales.

499,Creationist Question: What would drive selection for a new environment?,11,True,"This is something that comes up a lot, but rarely as clearly as in [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6banny/whale_evolution_vs_the_actual_fossil_evidence/) of whale evolution:

>but the question may become ""why does it select for living in the water instead of on land?"" It's certainly more likely that the animal the whale supposedly evolved from was already adapted for land just fine. I don't see why it would need this ""direction"" to evolve for the water. Chances are, as it's supposedly evolving into a whale, in the beginning it has some adaptations useful for water but still cannot live in water. Therefore they may be useless and actually provide a disadvantage for living on land.
Ideas?

 

Yes, we do have ideas. The very short answer is ""competition."" Too few resources in one place, so you start consuming them elsewhere, which drives selection for the new resources or environment.

 

The slightly longer answer is ""the competition-dispersal tradeoff,"" which is a dynamic where you can stay where you are and fight for resources (which carries a cost) or you can disperse to new resources (which also carries a cost). Selection favors the action that incurs the lower cost. High competition drives selection for dispersal. 

 

Read on for the long answer. 

 

So let's start with the basics: Resources are limited, so there is competition between individuals within populations. Unlike most of modern evolutionary theory, this observation goes back to Darwin himself. 

Because resources are limited, selection acts on those best adapted to survive and reproduce, and those beneficial traits increase in frequency. 

The question is, ""what drives selection for a new environment?""

 

The answer, as I said above, is competition, specifically a high level of competition in the ""old"" environment. When you have a population of, say, 100, in an area that can only support, say 50, those who are less well adapted for that environment will incur a very high cost to competing there - they will probably lose, which is to say die without reproducing. 

In such a situation, selection will favor dispersing to consume different resources rather than competing. This is not a conscious choice; some individuals will have alleles to consume only the ""old"" resources, so they compete, and they will lose. Others will have alleles that allow them to utilize slightly different resources. Just slightly. But they will encounter less competition, and so selection favors those alleles, which is to say they become more common generation after generation. 

 

Over many generations, the individuals that have dispersed away from the ""old"" environment may separate entirely from that population, and acquire morphological traits that allows that to consume completely different resources, or live in a completely different environment, from the parent population. 

 

In the specific case of whales, you have a population that lived on the edge of water. Some individuals were better at living and acquiring resources *within* the body of water, rather than competing for resources on its edge or on the nearby land. Nothing drastic, but some where better swimmers than others, for instance. Think Michael Phelps compared to your average human. Lung capacity, limb length, hand and foot size, etc. Relatively subtle differences that give a leg up in the different environment. For these individuals, selection favors ever more extreme versions of these traits that facilitate life in water - fins instead of legs, nostrils on top of the head, etc. 

Again, I want to make this very clear, there's no choices being made here. There is simply variation - some individuals better in the new environment, some worse. The better survive, and those traits - webbed fingers, for example - become more common. Over time, the mean phenotype shifts, and the extreme variants become more extreme. Eventually you get fins, loss of hind limbs, blowholes, etc. 

It's all down to competition driving directional selection for resource acquisition in a new environment. That's really it.

 

Now, one may wonder, that sounds fine, but do we *really* know this is what happens? 

Yes, we do, because we can watch it happen. One example is apple maggot flies. 

 

Apple maggot flies can consume two food sources: apples and hawthorn berries. Hawthorn berries are the native food source, but a subspecies has emerged that feeds and live exclusively on apples. This change was driven by competition for hawthorn berries driving adaptation to a new food source - apples. The apple-feeding population have reproductive cycles timed differently, which has adapted to maximize food availability for larva. This is exactly the dynamic I described above, but it's taken place only over the last two hundred years or so. 

 

So, what drives adaptation for a new environment? A lower cost associated with dispersal than competition. Easy.",1495073001,44,2017-05-17 22:03:21

To me, however, he seems to be guilty of equivocating.  ""Function"" has a specific meaning in Behe's analogy.
 
In Behe’s analogy, the mousetrap is part of a living being.  Its function is to catch mice.  Catching mice, therefore, is analogous to producing the effect of survival in the living being.  The ""completed"" mousetrap does this in a particular way,  but of course there are many ways to catch mice, just as our various organs produce the effect of survival in different ways.

403,A brief teleological defense of intelligent design...,4,True,"Here are a couple of criteria for identifying an intelligently designed thing.

1) It is assembled in a way that seems improbable (given our previous experience) as an effect of the operation of natural forces on such materials.

2) It seems to serve a specific function.

Biological life meets these criteria.

1) It is assembled in a way that seems improbable (given our previous experience) as an effect of the operation of natural forces on such materials.  

The regular operation of the forces of nature, in our experience, do not produce living things.  (Here I am confining myself to abiogenesis.  Evolution itself, as an unguided process, seems improbable to me as well, but I have already discussed that here recently.)

2) It seems to serve a specific function.

All of the systems and organs of living creatures exist for this purpose: to survive and reproduce. This makes biological life stand out among the regular effects of nature on physical objects, and it makes me think biological life is designed, just as the appearance of purpose in cars would make me (and I suspect everyone else) believe they were designed and not an effect of the regular operations of nature. And I would believe this even if I had only just learned about cars today and did not know the history of their making or who made them.

**Edit**:  In my original post I said biological creatures are unique in that they resist entropy by struggling to survive and reproduce. When we die, the genetic information that makes us who we are becomes disordered and lost and our ability to convert energy to work correlates directly with our being alive.  I therefore equated this struggle to survive with the struggle against entropy.  I still believe the struggle to survive is synonymous with resisting entropy in biological creatures.  Nevertheless, I have replaced the reference to entropy with the struggle ""to survive and reproduce"" because, if I am right (and the two are synonymous) this replacement doesn't matter anyway, but if I am wrong, it does.

I think there are at least three things to keep in mind if the whole issue is simply to distinguish designed from not designed in terms of biological life.

1) Imperfect designs are also the products of designers, so a design’s imperfections cannot rule it out as a created thing.

2) We may not be smart enough to judge the quality of the design in question.

3) What was once a perfect design may now be broken to some degree.

I realize that if number one is the case with biological life, that would rule out an omnipotent creator as the exclusive designer of biological life, but this is a secondary consideration.  All we are considering at the moment is whether or not the thing is designed.  One way to account for apparent imperfections might be to posit the existence of multiple designers: an original one (God) and subsequent imperfect ones.  For instance, a great many jokes could be made at the expense of a bulldog’s design flaws, but we know that this design is owing to the efforts of imperfect minds who have been given permission, for better or worse, to alter the design they first encountered.  There may be other designers than humans at work among living things.  

Anyone with even a modicum of humility should acknowledge the truth of number two. 

As for number three, when I consider the diverse, complex, and interrelated dance of living things on this planet, I am genuinely in awe.  It is sublime and breathtakingly beautiful.  At the same time it is tragic, filled with suffering and horror.  In other words, it seems to me like something that was once beautiful has been badly broken.

Yes! That *would* have to happen a lot for evolutionary theory to make sense. And it has! 

Genes that arise through duplications are called paralogous genes, or *paralogs*, and our genomes are full of 'em. 

 

Genes can be duplicated through a number of mechanisms. One common one is [unequal crossing over.](http://web.pdx.edu/~newmanl/UnequalXover.gif) Here is [a figure that shows how this can happen, and through subsequent mutations, lead to diversification.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Carrigan/publication/230616846/figure/fig4/AS:214095426002954@1428055735326/a-When-unequal-crossing-over-denoted-with-an-X-occurs-within-the-intergenic-region.png) 

 

But this isn't limited to single genes or small regions. You can have *genome* duplication, which is something we observe today in processes called [autopolyploidy](http://bio1151.nicerweb.com/Locked/media/ch24/24_10SymAutopolyploidy_3-L.jpg) and [allopolyploidy.](http://www.hammiverse.com/lectures/24/images/1-3.png) 

 

Here are a few examples:

 

Oxygen is carried in blood by proteins called globins, a family that includes the various types of myoglobin and hemoglobin. These all arose through a series of gene duplications from an ancestral globin, followed by subsequent mutations and selection. 

[Here's a general figure showing globin evolution.](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Globin_gene_evolution_2.gif)

[And here's more detail on the beta-globin family in different types of animals.](http://www.biologia.uniba.it/Darwin/04-occhio/occhio8.jpg) 

 

One of my favorite examples of the importance of gene duplication is the [evolution and diversification of opsins,](http://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/opsin_evolution2.jpg) the photosensitive proteins in animal eyes. These evolved from a transmembrane signaling protein called a G-protein coupled receptors. 

[Here's a much more detailed look,](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/364/1531/2819/F1.large.jpg) if you're interested. 

 

Finally, I can't talk about gene duplication without mentioning HOX genes, which are responsible for the large-scale organization of animal body plants. HOX genes are arranged in clusters, and work from front to back within the clusters. [All animals have one, two, four, and in some cases maybe six clusters, which arose through gene and *genome* duplication.](https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/evo%20devo%202016/macropic/hox%20genes.jpg) 

 

But how do we know that these genes actually share a common ancestor, rather than simply *appearing* to? [Because phylogenetic techniques have been evaluated experimentally, and they do a really good job showing the actual history of a lineage.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1736360) We've done the math. This type of analysis really does show relatedness, not just similarity. 

 

So yes, for evolution to work, we *do* needs lots of new information through gene duplication and subsequent divergence. And that's exactly what we see. I've given three examples that are particularly well documented, but these are far far from the only ones. ",1493785394,64,2017-05-03 00:23:14

411,"Creationist Claim: ""Biologists can't explain the evolution of introns/spliceosomes""",12,True,"Who wants to learn about early eukaryotic evolution? That's today's topic, the claim being that biologists are unable to explain how the eukaryotic genome, containing introns and using a splicesome to excise them following transcription, could have evolved. 

Unsurprisingly, the assertion that we have no plausible mechanism for these evolution of spliceosomes and introns is not true. We actually have several plausible mechanisms, and there isn’t a firm consensus on which is correct. 

 

[Here’s the mechanism I think is the most probable.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626174)

It starts with a genetic element called group II introns. These are found in bacteria, and they are auto-catalytic, that is, self-splicing. They are also mobile genetic elements, meaning they can move around in the genome. Finally, they are often associated with proteins called maturases, which are encoded by these elements, and have reverse transcriptase ability. So group II introns are transcribed, cut themselves, and can be reinserted elsewhere in the genome. 

 


But these are *bacterial* elements, and we’re talking about eukaryotic introns and splicing, which brings us to endosymbiosis of an alpha proteobacterium. Such an event is responsible for mitochondria. One of the hallmarks of endosymbiosis is the transfer of genes from the endosymbionts to the nuclear genome. We can see this happening right now with *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

 

Why does this matter? A protein called Prp8 is a major component of splicesomes, [and it is probably homologous with the maturases of group II introns.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078730/) So during the endosymbiotic process that resulted in the mitochondria, the mobile genetic elements to create introns and excise them from transcripts were probably transferred to the nuclear genome. I say “probably” because that’s how scientists talk, but the we have a pretty darn good grasp of phylogenetics, having experimentally verified a number of techniques. So I say “probably,” but I mean “almost certainly.”

 

Has this mechanism been demonstrated? Again, probably. [In this study,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217561) two new introns were documented in yeast, as a result of a process very similar to what I just described above (utilizing extant cellular components rather than ancient bacterial ones). 

 

So, to review, you don’t need anything for RNA splicing except auto-catalytic ribozymes, which we have. To get introns, you also need cellular retrotranscribing enzymes, which we also have. Best of all, it’s most likely that we (eukaryotes) acquired both elements during the endosymbiosis of alpha-proteobacteria, which resulted in the mitochondria. Isn’t that nifty? A bunch of the characteristics of eukaryotic cells all coming together at once through a set of related processes during the same evolutionary event (primary endosymbiosis of alpha proteobacteria). 

It’s only unexplainable if you’ve never tried to explain it.

417,Those pesky hind limbs,15,True,"Dorudon was a cetacean that lived in the Eocene. Beyond any doubt it was a marine animal, [you can tell this from its streamlined body shape](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2688267).

First of all, cetaceans are not fish but they belong to the mammals. We can tell from anatomy, DNA, physiology and behavior, like:

- they breath through lungs, not gills

- females produce milk to feed their newborns

- they belong to the placental animals 

- they give live birth

- the inner ear anatomy

- they are warm-blooded

- they propel through the water by up/down instead like fish left/right movement of the spine

- and some hundreds of other traits that link them to mammals.

Note: the traits above are mostly unique to mammals but there are some individual exceptions, for instance, live birth is also observed in other non-mammal species like some sharks but it is the total picture of hundreds of traits that make the point (and of course especially telling when sharing traits with mammals that are unique for those).

But the most telling trait that binds cetaceans to the mammals is their genetic make-up: of all animals living on earth, the one that resembles cetaceans genetically most by DNA comparison, is hippopotamus, an artiodactyl.  Not all too surprisingly, hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic animal.

There’s also anatomical evidence for cetaceans being artiodactyls:

- the double pulley joints anatomy of the ankle, a trait unique for artiodactyls

- a hooked knob pointing up towards the leg bones in the astralagus, unique for artiodactyls.

Dorudon is classified as a cetacean for a lot of anatomical reasons: 

- alignment of the upper incisors with the cheek teeth (typical for cetaceans)

- the nostril is not in the tip of the snout but has travelled to halfway its head

- the ear region is surrounded by a bony wall

- reduced pelvis and hind limb size (I come back to this!)

- structure of the tympanic bone

- the anatomy of the teeth

… and a few other traits that are unique for cetaceans.

Now we have established that cetaceans are mammals, belonging to the artiodactyls, we might pose the question why there are artiodactyls living n the oceans in the first place where their closest relatives all live on the land.

And those pesky hind limbs of Dorudon tells us why.

Dorudons and also another later, extinct cetacean, Basilosaur, have [fully developed hind limbs, attached to a pelvis]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Durodon_pelvis.jpg) and, [another specimen]( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7072/7282107938_e31856d35f_b.jpg) (both Dorudon atrox).

Those hind limbs were still fully developed according to basic amniote anatomy:

- femur including patella

- fibula and tibia

- tarsals and metatarsals

- digits

- neatly attached to a pelvis.

But perky those hind limbs were indeed:

- first of all, they were extremely small for such rather large animal (Dorudon was ~ 5 meters tall and weighted some 2 tons). The size of Dorudon’s hind limbs was about a modern housecat’s ones. I don’t think an animal that long and heavy could have walked with such small hind limbs

- but, moreover, the pelvis was detached from its spinal cord. You just can’t walk with hind limbs detached from the spinal cord

- also much of the ankle bones and carpals were fused as well, again making walking impossible.

Now the next, profound question here is: what was a *full-blown marine* animal doing with *fully developed, amniote type of* hind limbs which were *detached from the spinal cord* and *too small* for such a large animal and *whose ankle bones and carpals were fused*, making walking entirely impossible.

In other words, what was a fully marine animals, that used front flippers and a tail fluke for propelling, doing with hind limbs it couldn’t walk with?

If you want to engage, here are the rules when you want me to respond:

- if you want to rebut anything I wrote, only empirically founded arguments will be taken into consideration. Everything in my post is empirically founded so I expect your rebut to meet those requirements as well. Just ""It might well be that ..."", ""It could be that ...."" or any empirically unsubstantiated statement, like ""it used the hind limbs not to walk but to propel"" without any empirical evidence for it, will be discarded without further ado.

- Empirically founded means that you can point out to observations done by properly educatend experts on the matter. For instance, when you want to dispute the anatomical observations in my post, you must show me another observation done by a proper palaeontologist or anatomist.

What's everyone's single favorite piece of evidence that refutes evolution? [That's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/65tg0q/what_is_your_single_favorite_piece_of_evidence/) on r/creation, and since it is specifically dealing with evolution rather than creation, I think it's appropriate here. I've picked out some of my favorite posts, so here they are and the response. I'd love to hear from the original posters.

Here we go...

 

>Then we learn much more about how life works, and we realize that the slow rate of mutation is actually too slow to explain the complexity of life today. So either this planet has been supporting life for several orders of magnitude more than 6 billion years, or evolution is a slow process that occurs extremely rapidly.

>We see some cases of ""rapid evolution"" today, but they all seem to center around either killing off all of a particular critter that couldn't adapt (without creating something new) or enhancing an existing capability (say, stronger forelegs on a lizard that is dealing with heightened competition). We don't really see cases where an eye develops from a light-sensitive patch of skin.

The old ""evolution is too slow"" argument. Only deals with single-base nucleotide substitutions. No gene duplications, no genome duplications, no hybridization, and ignores actual observed cases of rapid changes happening. For example, the extremely rapid speciation in Lake Victoria cichlids, or the acquisition of a primary plastid in *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

 

>Evolution, even by admission of evolutionists, doesn't explain how something lifeless becomes living all by itself.

>Dead things stay dead. That is well known. Something living is needed to give life to what was not living.

>This was proven by Pasteur, and that's why ""Pasteurized"" is on bottles of milk, not ""Darwinized"" or ""Haeckelized"".
So if a miracle created the first life, then it becomes possible to believe other miracles could have created various species. We can guess what species were created by studying the mechanical difficulty of evolving one creature to another.

Abiogenesis happened. We have lots of evidence. RNA world. Spontaneous assembly of RNA polymers and vesicles, spontaneous appearance of self-replication, all demonstrated in the lab. 

 

>I don't know exactly what Pasteur did to disprove abiogenesis, but it seems like we can hit this pretty easily today - jar up some peaches, ensure the seal is good, pasteurize the heck out of it, then let it sit for ten years. Sure, it will break down into goop, but it won't actually spawn anything either.

Was the early earth a closed system?

 

>Ask them where the language of our DNA came from. As far as I know, it's universal across all organisms - certain genes code for particular proteins.

>If they believe evolution, then the almost have to believe that an entire coding language was just conveniently built into nature waiting to inevitably rise from the muck and write itself a masterpiece.

Assumes the DNA --> RNA --> protein pathway appeared intact, which...nobody thinks that. Also, the universality of the genetic code is evidence of common ancestry. There's no inherent reason it has to be the way it is. 

And on top of that, we have a decent idea of why the code adapted the way it did. For example, check out the super-cool work on why we use cytosine in our DNA (Google ""Confounded cytosine!""). 

 

>Nothing doesn't produce something and chaos doesn't produce order.

Really. This was in the ""what's your single favorite piece of evidence"" thread. Lots of elements + lots of energy. That's not ""nothing,"" and it's not chaotic. 

 

>Blood hounds smell better than any other dog, are they a different species?

Nope. But hybridized plants are. Or Lake Victoria cichlids. Or HIV. Or...

 

>Simply put, the reason the DNA across so many species being so similar doesn't necessarily point to them sharing a common ancestor; since DNA is literally a biological programming language, one could argue that the reason the DNA is so similar (and even identical in certain areas) is because the code is good, much like how various computer programs will share certain portions of code.

DNA is not a computer code. It doesn't direct activity. Each gene contains the information for a sequence of amino acids. That's it. It doesn't tell them what to do, where to go, how to interact. It's just little bits of biochemical activity that interact, and the interactions yield emergent properties. 

And it's not even a *good* way to store information. It's just better than RNA. Example: The most common mutation in cytosine turns it into uracil, which changes a G-C base pair into A-T. That's dumb. Why would you design it that way? If you can make it work however you want, don't make it like that. 

 

>The other piece of evidence that I like, but it's really technical is the difficulty evolving a prokaryote (like bacteria) into a eukaryote (like a human).

>I presented this to a Christian Darwinist who was a biology pre-med student, and in one hour he was converted to a creationist. The article is technical, it is a brutal read, but it's my favorited because of the level of scientific detail.
You can see for yourself, my detractors couldn't do much to refute the paper I cited written by Change Laura Tan who is a cellular biologist.

Because bacteria evolved directly into humans. And we've never observed something like endosymbiosis happening. Except that we're doing just that right now with *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

The arguments against this point when previously posted were quite good. If you take the most eukaryote-like archaean, and the most archaea-like eukaryote, they're pretty darn similar morphologically and biochemically. It really isn't that hard, unless you want to either lie or be ignorant. 

 

>Thanks to the 2nd law of thermodynamics...

Nope. 

Edit: Fine.

>Thanks to the 2nd law of thermodynamics and the fact that mutations are almost entirely harmful to living creatures, successfully compiling the vast quantity of useful information we see in the genetic codes of the millions of life forms worldwide would take nothing short of a miracle.

Most mutations are neutral, we have many mechanisms through which information can increase, and have examples of each. See HIV-1 Vpu for a simple example, eye evolution for a more complex example. 

 

And...that's it. Those are r/creation's favorite pieces of evidence against evolution.

436,How did homochirality emerge? Like this.,18,True,"So over the last few weeks, we’ve been talking a lot about junk DNA. I invited a bunch of frequent posters on r/creation to weigh in. A few did, most didn’t, but one said this:

> How about we debate the origins of chirality, instead? Why should we pander to discussing what he wishes, on an entirely different sub? I don't have the time to waste chasing down his pet example that no one has done the proper research to refute, yet.

Ask and ye shall receive. 

 

Chirality refers to the asymmetry of biological molecules – things like amino acids and nucleotides can be “right-handed” or “left-handed,” and biological systems only ever use one variant (L-amino acids, for example). 

Since a homochiral mixture will spontaneously become racemic over time, we need a mechanism through which homochirality could have appeared *before life began*. Creationists like to point to this problem as an insurmountable barrier for abiogenesis. Unsurprisingly, they are either ignorant of the work that has been done on this process, or dishonestly ignoring it. 

 

I’m going to keep this short, but here’s how homochirality could have appears in an abiotic environment.

 

One mechanism could have happened in space. Amino acids can form in space, and exposure to polarized light can lead to enantiomeric enrichment (EE), meaning that one variant is more common than the other. Here or [two](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2001ESASP.496..167M/0000167.000.html) [sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976459) on this mechanism. 

But how do you get from a relatively small EE to homochilarity? Autocatalysis! That’s when each variant promotes formation of more like it, and suppress formation of the opposite enantiomer, as demonstrated [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/16/5732.full.pdf). 

That mechanism can operate on earth or in space, but [here’s](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Ortiz16/publication/23421863_Evolution_of_Solid_Phase_Homochirality_for_a_Proteinogenic_Amino_Acid/links/09e4150caf2f1667a0000000/Evolution-of-Solid-Phase-Homochirality-for-a-Proteinogenic-Amino-Acid.pdf) another that’s earth-specific. Turns out physical disturbance can also lead to EE, which can then be followed by autocatalysis. 

 

But what about RNA? Turns out we have a mechanism for that as well. We know that RNA polymerization is catalyzed by the surface of various clay minerals. [Those same minerals can be stereoselective,](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-006-9022-9) preferentially associating with one enantiomer over the other. Once that happens – autocatalysis. 

 

So far from being an insurmountable problem for abiogenesis, we have multiple mechanisms for EE in abiotic systems. This simply isn’t the bogeyman creationists think it is. 

Want more? Here’s a [detailed review,](http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/5/a002147.full.pdf) and two [popular]( https://phys.org/news/2015-03-discovery-demystifies-life-chirality-phenomenon.html) [level](https://www.chemistryworld.com/feature/the-origin-of-homochirality/9073.article) articles. 

 

Your move, creationists. 

“But we’ve never observed abiogenesis!”

Yup. But the claim was there’s no way to generate homochirality abiotically. That claim is false. 

“But these aren’t *all* the amino acids/ribonucleotides!”

Yup. This work demonstrates the mechanism. 

“But the conditions are too specific and unrealistic!”

Okay, first, that’s called a “controlled experiment.” Second, the claim was there’s no way to generate homochirality abiotically. That claim is false.",1492357099,10,2017-04-16 11:38:19

Basically [this article](https://www.evolutionnews.org/2017/04/giant-virus-attacks-darwins-tree/) is a crock of ignorant excrement that amounts to ""biologists disagree about a new discovery, therefore evolution must be wrong."" Try to find an actual argument in there. Really. It's devoid of a point. 

 

Here's the deal. 

There are big viruses. BIG viruses. Bigger than some cells. With genomes that are bigger than some cells. Most of the ORFs in these genomes are of unknown function, but the ones that we do know have homologues in all three domains of cellular life - bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. 

This means there are two options here:

1. These viruses have infected a wide host range and acquired these genes via horizontal gene transfer.

2. These viruses share a common ancestor with the common ancestor of all cellular life. 

There is a third option that nobody really buys, but the DI states as now-discredited: that viruses represent an earlier, pre-cellular form of life (in other words, cells evolved from viruses). I don't know anyone who *really* buys that idea, but sure. Cells didn't evolve from viruses. Gotcha. Here's a participation trophy for that one, DI. 

So while the DI is setting up a strawman, real scientists are working out which of the two actual alternatives is more likely. 

 

**Option 1: Giant viruses acquired their genes via HGT.**

We know HGT between virus and host is a fairly common process, and some of the closest homologues to the genes in the viruses are found in their present hosts, or very similar organisms. The degree of similarity between some of the viral and host genes indicates the sequences haven't diverged that long ago. 

 

**Option 2: Giant viruses share a common ancestor with the common ancestor of all cellular life.**

Another way to state this is that these viruses are derived from very ancient cells. We know that viruses can evolve from cellular genetic elements. (My favorite example involves a plasmid stealing a capsid via HGT and becoming a virus.) [There has actually been a study hypothesizing this exact situation,](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015530&type=printable) in which a common ancestor diverges into *four* domains, the fourth being the giant viruses (technically called the NCLDVs - nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses). 

 

The best part of all this is that these hypotheses are *not* mutually exclusive. This is only one relatively small group of (very large) viruses. Other viruses originated independently. My money is on the coevolution of a core NCLDV genome as a parasite of the LUCA population (option 2), followed by a TON of HGT over the next 4-ish billion years (option 1). 

 

But man, people disagree, so I don't know if evolutionary theory can weather the storm. 

Stupid DI. We get new information, we make interesting observations, we figure out what explains them. We have two possible explanations, both fitting squarely within evolutionary theory. This is how science works. Not that the idiots writing for DI would know. ",1491955445,30,2017-04-11 20:04:05

The other says, ""wow! Look what was designed!""

If one observes something resembling design, the most common sense, rational, and simplest explanation is design, not random chance. 

Even if you accept the historical evolutionary narrative, then the most rational explanation is that the mutations were guided by an intelligent agent.

There is no evidence the mutations are ""random"".

Besides, DNA proves intelligent design. Why? Because *information* has it's cause in intelligence. It's that simple. Analyzing the human genome and the *instructions* in DNA is no different than analyzing human written code and its functions. 

Edit: Even if you argue that it is possible from chance, you have to prove that it indeed arose from chance.

(1/6)^10

= ~1.65x10^-8

 

So I booted up a random number generator and rolled my ten dice. If I got a 1, that one was done. More than one, roll again in next round. 

Below are the outcomes for all ten trials. The sequence of numbers indicates the pathway to 1. A dash indicates no roll, since it was already at 1 (i.e. purifying selection operating. If you don't know what that means, ask). A number in parenthesis means a roll higher than a previous roll, so selected against. 

 

Results:

    1)	3	    2	    2(4)	1	    -	    -	    -	    1

    2)	5	    2	    2(2)	2(5)	2(4)	2(4)	2(5)	1

    10) 1	    -	    -	    -	    -	    -	    -	    1

 

It only took eight ""generations"" for all ten replicates to hit 1. This whole exercise took less than 10 minutes. 


 

Why is this here? Because I don't want to hear a word about the improbability of random mutation ever again. The probability stated above (~1.65x10^-8) assumes that everything has to happen *without selection, in a single generation*. But selection is a thing, and it negates any and all ""big scary numbers"" arguments against evolution. This little simulation gets at why. ",1491618381,88,2017-04-07 22:26:21

Two humans who share a broken gene are more likely to have that broken gene in common because they descended from a common human ancestor than because they developed the broken gene in themselves independently.  The arguments are not as strong when applied to creatures that do not interbreed.  Chimps and humans do not interbreed.  In order to claim that a broken gene common to chimps and humans is the result of common descent, one must first provide a probable explanation for how the ancestors of humans and chimps could have interbred in spite of the fact that they do not now interbreed.  Otherwise, one should look for other reasons to explain this shared broken gene than common descent.
  
In an earlier post, I proposed that such a gene might have broken independently among primates, but the general consensus on that thread was that, while this is possible and there are mechanisms to account for it, it is so improbable that I should not accept it as an explanation.

  
But what is the alternative?  To me, it certainly does not seem more probable that the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution has led to the increase of genetic information required to move from the first living cell to every modern form of life.  Any honest assessment of the variables involved in such a process must concede that they are unimaginable, if not incalculable.  To say that they dwarf those involved in the coincidental breaking of shared genes is a profound understatement.  As an example of just one tiny fiber in a thread of the massive tapestry of life, consider the probability of a land animal becoming a whale.  David Berlinski (Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University, a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics and molecular biology at Columbia University, author of works on systems analysis, differential topology, theoretical biology, analytic philosophy, and the philosophy of mathematics) puts this very starkly (beginning at around 11:00) in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ElA0--JNg) .   In [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c&index=4&list=PL3E4krOqKtJtPtPKjBlPi8cIfprDXijKO) , William Lane Craig cites physicists John Barrow and Frank Tippler’s actual estimate of the probability of the evolution of the human genome by the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution.  It is genuinely staggering.  And it only estimates the probability of human evolution.  What are the numbers incorporating every known life form? 
     
Why should we accept so improbable an explanation?  And if we do not have a probable explanation for common descent, why should we not look for other, less improbable, explanations for common features (i.e., common initial design, subsequent coincidental breaking of genes, etc.)?  Such explanations are not only less improbable by comparison but are in harmony with what we actually observe in things such as the inability of chimps and humans to interbreed.  Even Richard Dawkins, in [his debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwsuGiSzCkc&t=402s) with Rowan Williams (around 6:20), concedes that living creatures “look overwhelmingly as though they have been designed.”  Indeed, “appearance of design” is a frequent expression among evolutionists, which is essentially an acknowledgement that design should be the default position, to be abandoned only when a more probable explanation appears.

458,"""Darwin’s Delusion vs. Death of the Fittest"" or ""I Don't Know What Sperm Does"" by S. Cordova",19,True,"[Darwin’s Delusion vs. Death of the Fittest](http://www.uncommondescent.com/darwinism/darwins-delusion-vs-death-of-the-fittest/) by S. Cordova. Oh, wait. Could that be /u/stcordova? You're damn right it is! I'd page him, but I'm sure he'll be along shortly.

This ludicrous abomination was written by our creationist-in-safespace, back on June 2, 2013. Barrack Obama was fresh into his second term of president. I was getting stoned on my couch. And I didn't know /u/stcordova existed. It was a simpler time. 

So, what is the article about? It's about how clearly, inheritance of genetic material leads to accumulation of error. It cites a few scientific papers which are easily debunked. The majority of the opening is needlessly fluff, plus a boner-inspiring picture of a woman carrying eight fetuses, leading me to believe she's part-hamster. Unfortunately, this article doesn't appear to be about the risks of animal-human chimeras, nor was it penned by a Dr. Moreau, so I don't think we're going to discuss that.

The first scientific concept to be abused is [Mutational Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_meltdown), which suggests that in a small population, negative mutations can accumulate and lead to an extinction event if it occurs in a rather tight timespan, such that there is not enough time to select the mutations away -- this would only happen in an incredibly inbred population.

So, let's see how he abuses it:

>How about humans? Were our ancestors more fit than we? Even though we are more technologically advanced than our ancestors were, we are more sickly.

...are we? He cites the following [intelligent design trash](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/is-human-intellect-degenerating/). I'll admit, their case is better than his: there are a lot more creationists around than I remember prior, but that might have something to do with the Internet. But it's also blatantly false, as we set new world records at the Olympics every four years and we have a positive IQ drift -- in most of the world, at least. So, I don't see it. At least he's consistently wrong, as we seem to be at an evolutionary pinnacle.

So, now we start looking into arguments about dropping features:

>Let’s start with blind cave fish. Blind cave fish presumably evolved to be blind. Living in totally dark environments, functioning eyes became a metabolic liability. Hence, fish that lost their eyesight became more reproductively successful, even though they are functionally disabled.

...okay? Yes, this is how it works. If we lived around a dark star, you could bet that vision would be way, way down on the evolutionary ladder. It still takes many, many, many generations to see any effect and you have to apply that pressure to the whole population, not just small divisions. Otherwise, the movement of individuals and the mixture of genes will maintain a floor to the attribute and even prevent speciation.

>Another example of “survival of the sickest” is sickle cell anemia where a defect in the blood enables African populations to better cope with malaria. Individuals suffering from sickle cell anemia would hardly view the condition as evidence of being “fit”.

You only have to survive to reproductive age, and pass on your genes, to be considered 'fit' enough. You could die the moment after you ejaculate, as long as you get the job done. It won't help your kids, but maybe she's a good woman.

>But what about anti-biotic resistance and superbug bacteria? Superbugs are more reproductively successful, but in the overwhelming majority of cases, reproductive success was the result of dysfunction, not increase in integrated complexity.

Uh...okay. I know that's a lie. But let's note that, and see what he thinks supports it.

>In his article, [Is Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics an Appropriate Example of Evolutionary Change?](https://www.trueorigin.org/bacteria01.php), Kevin Anderson lists 40 of the major cases of anti-biotic resistance, and *almost all were the result of broken pumps, bad expression of proteins*, etc.

Oh, great, he's citing another creationist website. This must be from before his scientific literate phase, when Salvatore was still puppeting Ray Comfort. Keep an eye on that italicized phrase, it's going to come back later.

Kevin Anderson appears to be a shitty scientist:

>When rifampin is present, this mutation provides a decided advantage for survival compared with those cells lacking these specific mutations.  But, each of these mutations eliminates binding affinity of RNA polymerase for the rifampin.  As such, these mutations do not provide a mechanism accounting for the origin of that binding affinity, only its loss.

Okay? How would acquiring resistance to an anti-biotic by mutating a gene EVER provide a mechanism for the origin of said gene? It's further down the timeline, by its nature it can't explain that. You might as well ask when my wife is going to give birth to my grandmother -- it doesn't work that way, and not just because I'm not married.

Mr. Anderson seems to think that a short-term loss of functionality is demonstration that functionality could never be restored. He ignores that the mutation can be unwritten once the bacteria is capable of surviving in the environment. He also ignores that specialization always has a cost.

>Mutations that reduce or eliminate the repression control of MarR result in over-production of the MarAB efflux pump, which enables the cell to expel higher concentrations of antibiotics or other antibacterial agents (Oethinger et al., 1998; Poole, 2000; Zarantonelli et al., 1999).

Remember those italics? Yeah. This is where the functioning pump is.

>However, a mutation that causes loss of regulatory control (in this case the repressor protein, MarR) does not offer a genetic mechanism that can account for the origin of this regulatory control.

And yet again, he's looking for origins from a mutation.

Let's move back, because what's coming next is a ton of fun and how this article got its subtitle. And it's incredibly wrong. I could have just gone to this, but I felt like tearing up his entire work first to really nail down how empty his theory is.

>[The following video is a crude 1-minute silent animation that I and others put together.](https://youtu.be/SrIDjvpx7w4) God willing, there will be major improvements to the animation (including audio), but this is a start. Be sure to watch it in full screen mode to see the details.

>The animation asserts that if harmful mutation rates are high enough, then there exists no form or mechanism of selection which can arrest genetic deterioration. Even if the harmful mutations do not reach population fixation, they can still damage the collective genome.

>The animation starts off with healthy gingerbread parents. Each parent spawns 2 gingerbread kids, and the red dots on the kids represent them having a mutation. To simplify the animation, the reproduction was depicted as asexual, but the concept can easily be extended to sexually reproducing species.

>The missing gingerbread limbs are suggestive of severe mutations, the more mild mutations are represented by gingerbread kids merely having a red dot and not having severe phenotypic effects of their mutation. The exploding gingerbread kids represent natural selection removing the less functionally fit from the population. 4 generations are represented, and the fourth generation has three mutations per individual.

Simple form: negative mutations are passed on. Therefore, mutations will keep accumulating, until the population dies! THEREFORE, EVOLUTION IS A LIE! A FUCKING LIE! Sure. If you're an idiot.

Among the bacterium, this logic is true. But amongst bacteria, they produce huge populations. They double every 20 minutes regularly, compared to humans which might double every 3 or 4 generations optimistically [50-70 years]. The negative mutations aren't a concern, because those that get them die quickly, and those that don't take their place.

But in humans, we got a better strategy: I got a dick and balls. It's mostly about those balls though: did you know the average ejaculation has between 200 and 500 million individual sperms? You know what's the most interesting thing about my sperms? They only have half my genome.

Why does that matter? Well, I have two copies of every gene. If I pick up a bad one, hopefully the second is okay. But if my sperm gets a bad one, he's a dead sperm. He's not making it to the egg -- [he's one of these badboys](http://www.conceiveeasy.com/uploads/treating-abnormal-sperm.png). Sperm isn't as complex as a person, so this genetic beta test isn't perfect -- but it's enough that most serious errors get caught long before there's an individual.

That's 200m to 500m potential people. And only one of them, the most perfect one [in theory] gets through. Unfortunately, the egg doesn't have quite the same mechanism -- I recall egg-genesis splits into 4 germ cells, of which only one is selected to be an egg and the others shut down.

So, what does he close this shitty video with?

>Note the persistence of bad mutations despite any conceivable mechanism of selection. 

Yes. No *conceivable* mechanism. *Conceivable*. As in *conception*. Penis-in-vagina. Am I dumbing this down enough?

459,"Question about ""random"" mutation...",6,True,"What do evolutionists mean by random mutation?

It seems to me that there are two possibilities:

1) The mutation is a brute fact of reality; it has no cause.

2) The mutation has an unknown cause (or causes), hence its unpredictability.

Possibility number one cannot be right because this would amount to an argument from ignorance.  We would be moving from the premise “I don’t know the cause of mutation X” to the conclusion, “Therefore, mutation X has no cause,” and this would never be rationally justified.  

That leaves possibility number two, but this option concedes that the mutation is an effect of particular (as yet unknown) conditions on particular individuals. 
  
To me, this makes plausible the idea that those mutations we share with chimps appeared independently in human and chimp genomes.  True, the probability that the mutation occurred in one individual (an ancestor common to both chimps and humans) rather than in two (the ancestor common to all humans and the ancestor common to all chimps) is greater, but in the overall scheme of things, this difference does not seem very significant to me, especially once one concedes that the mutation is a result of particular (though unknown) causes which are likely to affect individuals with comparable genetic structures in the same way.

461,"The “Irreducible Complexity is Not a Valid Objection to Evolutionary Theory, Period” Thread.",21,True,"This has been floating around a bit since last week, and it needs to be put to bed. I know this thread won’t accomplish that, but the point here is to briefly (well, sort of…) run through the argument that irreducible complexity is a refutation of evolutionary theory and all of the different ways it fails. 

 

First, we have to define irreducible complexity (IC). The “modern” version of this concept comes from biochemist Michael Behe, who articulated the idea in his 1996 book  “Darwin’s Black Box.”

Here’s how Behe defines/explains irreducible complexity:

> By irreducibly complex, I mean a single system which is necessarily composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly, that is by continuously improving the initial function which continues to work the same mechanisms by slight successive modifications of a pre-cursor system, because any pre-cursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is, by definition, non-functional.

> An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually, it would have to arise as an integrated unit in one fell swoop for natural selection to have anything to act on.

 

There are a few different ways to interpret this concept. One can read it as simply defining IC, without drawing larger conclusions for the validity of evolutionary theory, or one can read it as drawing from IC the conclusion that evolutionary theory is largely invalid. I favor the latter interpretation, because of this line:

> An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution.

This indicates that Behe *is* using IC to draw conclusions regarding the validity of evolutionary theory. That’s the whole point; IC is supposed to refute evolutionary theory. 

 

We can further interpret this idea in two ways. Based on the above articulation, it seems to me that Behe is excluding a number of evolutionary process from consideration when it comes to the origin of IC systems. 

Specifically:

>cannot be produced directly, that is by continuously improving the initial function...

Assumes constant selective pressure (i.e. a constant fitness landscape – no variation in what is adaptive or deleterious over time), and also excludes useful intermediate states.

 

>...the initial function which continues to work the same mechanisms...

Excludes exaptation, the co-opting of structures that do one thing to do something else. 

 

>...by slight successive modifications of a pre-cursor system...

Excludes all mutations except single-base substitutions.

 

All of these excluded processes are mechanisms of evolutionary change. To simply exclude them from consideration when trying to evaluate the “evolvability” of a system is completely invalid. If this is in fact how Behe intends to use the concept of IC, which I believe it is based on his own definition, then the hypothesis “IC systems cannot evolve” is not even wrong. Identifying a system as IC has no bearing on its evolvability if that characterization excludes most evolutionary mechanisms. 

So, **Option 1: Irreducible complexity cannot address whether complex systems can evolve.**

This is how I interpret Behe’s argument, as articulated above, so personally, this is why it fails.  

 

But let’s say I’m wrong, and IC *doesn’t* exclude all of those processes. Let’s say all evolutionary processes are fair game. Again, I don’t think this is the correct way to interpret the above argument, but let’s just say. 

If this is the case, IC is at least theoretically applicable to the question of evolvability, and under this interpretation, there are two further ways to interpret Behe’s argument.

  

First, he could mean that *no* systems identified as IC could evolve; if a system that meets the conditions for IC exists, it could not have evolved, period. This is demonstrably false. Two simple counterexamples are HIV-1 Vpu and the Cit+ line in the Lenski LTEE. I want make clear: These are not systems thought to be irreducible that have been shown to actually not be. These are examples that adhere to Behe's definition, but that we have *documented* evolving. Which means, if the hypothesis is “systems identified as IC cannot evolve,” then that hypothesis is false. 

**Option 2: Irreducible complexity fails as a refutation of evolutionary theory.**

 

Or, Behe could simply be arguing that *some* IC systems cannot evolve. Some can, some can’t. Which means that the above examples don’t falsify the hypothesis. In fact, no counterexamples would, because this formulation leaves open the possibility that there is always the *chance* that we *might* find some system that cannot have evolved. And even then, it would still have to be *demonstrated* that such a system cannot have evolved. This is not falsifiable. It is a classic designer-of-the-gaps argument.

**Option 3: Irreducible complexity, as a refutation of evolutionary theory, is not falsifiable.**

 

And those are the three ways to interpret the hypothesis that identifying a system as irreducibly complex precludes the evolution of that system. Each interpretation necessarily leads to a different outcome. The hypothesis is either inadequate to address the question, false, or unfalsifiable. [Here's a flowchart.](http://imgur.com/hkcHiql)

465,DarwinZDF42 can't explain evolution of homochirality in proteins,0,True,"I claim DarwinZDF42, the resident PhD in Genetics and microbiology and professor of evolutionary biology can't give a credible explanation of the evolution of homochirality in linear polypeptids called proteins from a primordial environment.

The infamous Urey-Miller experiment and those like it created heterochiral racemic mixtures of amino acids.  Even if, because of some asymmetry properties in physics or homochiral amplification happened briefly, it won't last long (relative to geological time) because the Gibbs free energy favors  spontaneous formation of racemic rather than homochiral pools of amino acids, not to mention the polymerization step if done through high heat (such as in Sidney Fox's proto proteins) destroys homochirality.

There have been a few claimed experiments to solve the homochirality problem, but they involved things other than amino acids many times, and the few times they did involve amino acids, they were not heterogenous mixes of amino acids and the amplification process involved ridiculous wetting and drying cycles in non realistic conditions.  And they would become racemic anyway after they laid around a while.  The Gibbs free energy favors formation of racemic rather homochiral soups over time.  One can't fight basic physics and chemistry.  That is the natural and ordinary direction of chemical evolution.

Furthermore, in water, the Gibbs free energy favors spontaneous hydrolysis reactions, not the requisite condensation reactions.  The only desperate solution is to have the poor amino acids sit on a shore where they can dry a little bit during the day in low tide to undergo condensation reactions. But then, they won't likely be alpha-peptide bonds (like in real life) but other kinds of bonds, and they might likely not form  linear polymers.  Oh well.

And after all that, the poor proto-protein will have to fall back into that warm little pond to form life before the spontaneous hydrolysis reactions blow it apart again.

But beyond all that, the sequence of the amino acids has to be reasonably right (more improbability), and we need lots of proteins simultaneously in the right context along with energy sources like ATP to get things going.  Hard to have ATP without proteins.  That is the chicken and egg problem, so to speak.

So why the need for homochirality?  Look at the Ramachandran plot of amino acids:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandran_plot

If there is a mix of chirality, then there will be a mix of natural ""turning"" ability of amino acids in a peptide chain.  The result of such a mix is the inability to form necessary protein secondary structures like the alpha helix:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix

With the exception of the one residue that isn't chiral (glycine) this would mean a set of functional peptides with 500 chiral residues would have to be all left (or all right) to create such secondary structures necessary for function.  The probability of this happening by chance is:

2^500 ~= 3.2 x 10^150

DarwinZDF42 could try to address these points, but I expect a literature bluff and noise making, not a real response.    Would that be a responsible thing to do for his students?

From wiki:
>Topoisomerases are enzymes that participate in the overwinding or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this torsion would eventually stop the ability of DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand.

>In order to prevent and correct these types of topological problems caused by the double helix, topoisomerases bind to double-stranded DNA and cut the phosphate backbone of either one or both the DNA strands. This intermediate break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed again. Since the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not change, the tangled and untangled DNAs are chemical isomers, differing only in their global topology, thus the name for these enzymes. Topoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of DNA.[1]

>Bacterial topoisomerase and human topoisomerase proceed via the same mechanism for replication and transcription.

Here is a video showing what topoisomerase has to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fbPUGKurI

Now, since topoisomerase is so important to DNA replication and transcription, how did topoisomerase evolve since the creature would likely be dead without it, and if the creature is dead, how will it evolve.

https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2017/03/correcting-correction-of-video-about.html#more

>inclusive fitness as the key concept that was omitted. By doing that, you are emphasizing natural selection over drift and that just adds to the original misconception. Inclusive fitness is a insignificant factor in evolution in 90% of all species because individuals don't even know who their relative are. (Think bacteria and protozoa.) In the rest, mostly animals, inclusive fitness only accounts for fixation of a small percentage of the alleles that are fixed by natural selection. Furthermore, alleles fixed by selection are only a fraction of those fixed by random genetic drift. 

>I'm afraid that Sally Le Page has missed the real problem in the original video and only made the misconception worse by bringing up inclusive fitness. 

>The last point (#6) is complicated. Charlie_McDonnell said in the video that we share 50% of our DNA with bananas. This is clearly incorrect. I don't know what the exact number might be but let's do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Let's say that bananas and humans have 10,000 orthologous protein-coding genes and let's say the coding regions are 50% identical in amino acid sequences. That would account for less than 0.5% of the genomes. Adding in a bit of other genes and functional sequences won't get us over 1%. The rest is mostly junk DNA and it's unlikely there is any significant sequence similarity. We certainly don't share 50% of our DNA with bananas.

Edit: Yes, these two argument are contradictory, unless you assume an unrealistically high percentage of deleterious mutations and an unrealistically low percentage of adaptive mutations. 

You can either have a mutation rate so high that the bad stuff builds up so fast that the good stuff and selection can't keep up (but there are a large number of adaptive mutations occurring as well), OR you have very slow accumulation of adaptive mutations, which implies a low overall mutation rate, which means no genomic entropy.

477,What are some great evolution and/or abiogenesis video recommendations to watch with my anti-evolution parents?,9,True,"Backstory (or see tl;dr at bottom), I was raised in a very conservative Baptist environment, similar to Westboro. We were convinced evolution is a lie pushed by the ""atheists' agenda"" and we loved watching stuff like Kent Hovind's DVD series. A few years ago, after leaving that environment, I finally decided to learn about evolution for myself and was mind-blown. I couldn't get enough of it. One question would lead to another, and I was just constantly trying to learn more about it. When my parents learned of this, naturally, they were very disturbed. At first, things were very tense between us, but they (especially my dad) have started to open up more. We've had some very deep conversations about religion and life and when I bring up evolution, I can tell he's really listening to me. 

Of course, they're still convinced that to accept evolution is to reject God, but I've been trying to explain how that's a misconception, since science doesn't deal with the super natural, at least, not yet.

My dad is very intelligent and a critical thinker. He moved here from Russia with his wife & 3 little kids in 1990, learned English on his own, went to school, got a good paying job... he's the type who can fix just about anything; a hard worker and very smart, but also very humble. Just a really great person all around! Lately, he will come across a anti-evolution video that will seem very persuasive to him and he will share it with me. We will watch it together and then I'll tell him what I think and he actually listens to me. This happened last night, and then before I left, I jokingly said ""Well, now that we watched your video, next time we will watch a video I pick about evolution!"" And he and my mom were like ""Ok, that's only fair!"" 

So.... if you were in my place, what would be your best go-to videos in this situation?

481,did bacteria really evolve a new gene to eat Nylon?,6,True,"The NCSE in 1985 said this:


https://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help


**New Protein's Without God's Help**

>""We've been trying to explain all this to the protein ""experts"" at ICR for the last seven years. We have told them that new proteins could indeed form from the random ordering of amino acids. We have warned them that their calculations were based on faulty assumptions and soon someone would document **the natural formation of a new protein from the random association of amino acids.**

>Now it has happened! Not one, but two, new proteins have been discovered. In all probability **new proteins are forming by this process all the time, but this seems to be the first documentation of this phenomenon.** The newly discovered proteins are enzymes that break down some of the byproducts produced during nylon manufacture. **Since nylon first came into commercial production in 1940, we know that the new enzymes have formed since that time.**""


I took the original papers going back to the 1975 researchers and manually entered some of the sequences into the NIH BLAST programs.

I haven't looked at NylA yet, but a little BLASTing at the NIH NCBI gene banks gave me some interesting discovery.  It turns out other bacteria have highly similar genes already that eat nylon.    When the NCSE put out this essay, it was before people figured out a functional version of the gene was already in existence.

Here is the Accession number for the NylB gene in Flavobacteria:
WP_012476894.1 

Tell me if you get a similarity hit elsewhere using NIH approved tools like this one:
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

Hmm, I got a hit with that registered as this accession number of Agromyces: BAE97621.1 with 100% coverage and 99% identity!  Whoa!  The gene already existed, maybe for million of years (if you believe in Old Earth).  It might not bee that new.

Get that!  The ""new"" gene in Flavobacteria that the NCSE was crowing about already existed in Agromyces, but when the NCSE put out it's essay in 1985, the Argromyces genes had not been sequenced and published yet (which happened in 2007).  So the NCSE was making an argument based on ignorance.


I also got a lot of similarity to WP_012476894.1 ( 6-aminohexanoate hydrolase) in other bacteria, suggesting the basic proteins and genes existed elsewhere than what the NCSE article insinuates.

This paper on Agromyces points out Agromyces also can degrade nylon, so the Flavobacterium that Darwinists have be crowing about didn't really have that novel a gene, it existed in other bacteria, so by definition it isn't novel:

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172308700148

One alternative is to argue 392 amino acid residues (or about 1200 nucleotides) simultaneously evolved in to different bacteria since 1935 from a random sequence.  But Darwinists surely can't believe that.

One can invoke horizontal gene transfer, but that is still problematic since the pOAD2 plasmid on flavobacteria that enabled nylon degradation could just as well come from a pre-existing gene on another bacteria, so this doesn't solve anything.


Or did that sequence pre-exist in both those bacteria (minus a tweak here or there)?  If they pre-existed, it's hard to say they weren't already expressed genes.  For all we know the Agromyces nylon eating gene could already eat Nylon.  But if it evolved, how many  nucleotide changes do Darwinists think was involved from the ancestral gene?   

Now some of Darwinsits need some biochemistry understanding.   Suppose an enzyme that degrades one substance gets tweeked to degrade nylon, it probably means the enzyme loses specificity for another substance it might have been used for before.  So to gain catalytic function in one dimension, it likely has to lose it in another.  That's how enzymes are.  Or were you Darwinists naïve enough to think acquisition of a new catalytic function by and existing gene implied the new function did not come at the price of destroying pre-existing function?  

So if one has to blow apart something that's working to make something else work, that's not good for evolving more complexity that involves new enzymes in addition to pre-existing ones.  Don't Darwinists realize there is an accounting problem here?

>did bacteria really evolve a new gene to eat Nylon?

It could just as well be said Darwinian process destroyed a pre-existing function in order to create a different one.   It evolved, but not in a cumulative way that is needed to do macroevolution from simpler to more complex.",1489710366,134,2017-03-16 20:26:06

Let’s take a look at some of this other work. I like this one: The section titled “Irreducible Complexity” from [Three Puzzles Evolution Can’t Solve.]( https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/three-puzzles-evolution-cant-solve/)

 

I’m just going to go through it top to bottom with my thoughts. Let’s see how Jeanson does, shall we?

 

Right of the bat, quote mine. Great start. 

 

First section if “Irreducibly Complex Cells,” in which Jeanson waxes on how complicated the DNA ➔ RNA ➔ Protein pathway is, and how it couldn’t have evolved. There’s even a little inset called “all or nothing.”

I wonder if he’s heard of ribozymes?

 

The next section is about four ways evilutionists try to explain things.

First is artificial selection, which he brushes aside as invalid because it’s not *natural selection*. Nevermind that the mechanism is the same.

Then comes a bit on “evolutionary scaffolds,” which I take to mean simpler structures intermediate to modern cells. Fine such as it is, but he then takes the term literally and says well bridges need designers, so evolutionary theory fails. No discussion of the idea of, for example, protocells on its merits. 

Third is…phylogenetics? He doesn’t use the word, but that’s what he describes. Except, nobody uses phylogenetics as evidence *for* evolution. Like, if you said to me, ""give me the single best argument for evolution!"" I'd probably talk about the eye. Then maybe I'd explain how we can use phylogenies to show the relationships. It’s a way to determine and organize evolutionary relationships. I don’t know what this guy thinks phylogenetics is, but he’s wrong. 

Then neutral evolution, which he claims is a synonym for “luck.” And the counterargument, of course, is that it’s too improbable. 

Except that it isn’t, and neutral mechanisms (which are not the same thing as random mechanisms, which someone claiming to be an expert should know) aren’t the only things going on. It’s not selection *or* random mutation *or* drift, it’s all of them together, at the same time. 

 

The next section…oh. That’s it. That’s the whole thing. 

<checks again>

Yup. That’s it. No evidence provided. No data presented. Just “cells are complicated!” and then half-assed evasions of four things he *thinks* biologists use to argue for evolutionary theory, except he even gets those wrong because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I really don’t think those are deliberate straw men, I think he’s just that clueless. 

What a tool. Textbook liar for Jesus. Gritted out a Ph.D. so he could play a scientist on the internet, without actually understanding any of the words he's using. What a fraud, and an insult to real scientists who put in time and effort and did and continue to do real work. I have nothing but contempt for this charlatan.

493,"Creationist Scientist Dr. Nathaniel's Jeanson's rebuttal to the article ""Creationists Invent Their Own Mutation Rate!"" which criticizes his research regarding mutation rates & mitochondrial DNA. Any science experts care to check out his response and share their thoughts with me?",10,True,"Dr. Jeanson's response to article (http://www.evoanth.net/2016/05/23/invent-mutation-rate/)

i) The main claim is that my mutation rate is 35x faster than the published one. In fact, if you look at the article the author cites, the ""published"" rate (Soares et al) is one derived first assuming evolution and millions of years, and then fitting facts to these conclusions. For example, Soares et al first assume an ancient timescale (the very fact that my research contradicts), and then fit DNA differences to this timescale. Not only is this circular reasoning (i.e., assuming evolution to prove evolution), it's also indirect science. It's analogous to trying to measure the rate of erosion in the Grand Canyon...by measuring the depth of the Canyon, assigning millions-of-years dates to each layer, and then calculating the rate of erosion...rather than actually physically measuring it. So the main claim of the blog you cited is not a logically sound or scientifically compelling argument against my published work.

ii) ""By adding null results from small studies like this he could effectively fine tune his mutation rate."" Here, the blog author accuses me of dishonesty. In fact, my goal in citing these additional studies were for the purpose of complete transparency and rigor. I cited all possible studies I could find. If the author of the blog really wanted to accuse me of cherry-picking, the author should have cited many studies I missed (which the author doesn't do).

iii) The author tries to explain away my published mutation rate by invoking three possible scenarios under which my actual mutation rate would drop. 
The first scenario envisions a movement from heteroplasmy to homoplasmy; the author thinks this is not a mutation. For the sake of argument, let's grant the author this conclusion. But now let's take it to its logical conclusion. Ask: Where did the heteroplasmic mutations come from? The only possible answer is mutation. Therefore, perhaps we should look at changes in heteroplasmic mutations, rather than changes in homoplasmic. If you look at the same table from the Ding study, you will find that the rate of heteroplasmic changes is 4x higher than the homoplasmic ones--which makes the problems for evolution even worse. So this argument doesn't stand up to scrutiny. (In fact, sticking to homoplasmic mutations is the most scientifically conservative approach to this question, for reasons that get into significant technical depth.) 
The second scenario and third scenarios invoke a similar principle--that I scored somatic mutations rather than germline ones. In theory, this could be a valid objection. But, again, let's take it to its logical conclusion. For example, the author of the blog took for granted that number of mitochondrial DNA differences among the different people groups. But how many of these have been validated as germline changes and not somatic ones? For example, the author has no problem with my citation of 123 differences being the max difference between two humans--but how does the blog author know that these differences are germline ones? Furthermore, the evolutionary mitochondrial Eve and out-of-Africa model is founded on the assumption that mitochondrial differences among ethnic groups are germline. Should this be questioned now as well? If the author of the blog is not careful, he will soon undermine the entire mitochondrial DNA field! 
But for sake of argument, let's conservatively say that this germline-somatic dilemma is enough to prevent us from reliably inferring a mutation rate from the Ding study. What does the blog author suggest that we invoke instead? The logically circular rate derived from Soares et al?

Let me further address these second and third scenarios with some questions of my own for the blog author:

-If the rate I cited from Ding's data is invalid, why does it agree with the 7+ studies that have been published previously? (See Table 4 of the following paper, as well as the discussion therein: https://answersingenesis.org/.../recent-functionally.../) Why is there such strong scientific consistency across multiple independent scientific studies? If the blog author wishes to question the conclusions of the one study he cites, he has a lot more evaluating and explaining to do than the single paper with which he interacts.

-Why do mitochondrial DNA clocks point towards a young-earth and reject a millions-of-years timescale for every other species in which the mitochondrial DNA mutation rate has been measured? (See the following: https://answersingenesis.org/.../spectacular.../; https://answersingenesis.org/.../on-the-origin-of.../) Please note: In the fruit fly, roundworm, water flea, and yeast mitochondrial mutation rate studies, the rates were measured in mutation accumulation lines--in other words, over several generations of genealogically-related individuals. Almost by definition, these studies measure germline mutations--not somatic ones. Why do all of these studies agree so strongly?

-What testable predictions does the blog author's model make? This is the gold standard of science--the one to which creationists have been held for years. If the blog author thinks that he has a better answer than what I have published, I challenge him to make scientifically testable predictions from it. For example, from my young-earth creation model, I can predict (i.e., I'm claiming that I can) the mitochondrial mutation rate in the millions of species in which it has yet to be measured. I'm willing to test my predictions in the lab. I challenge the blog author to do the same. Otherwise, by the evolutionists' own standards, the blog author's claims pseudoscience.

You might have noticed that these three questions that I ask refer to an extensive literature that has already been published on this topic--literature with which the blog author never interacts. You could almost say that the author seems to be cherry-picking which studies to address and which ones to ignore. I'm not saying this to accuse--my actual opinion on the subject is that I presume that he has no idea that this published literature exists. Rather, my point is saying this is to show that the ""cherry-picking"" stereotype can cut both ways.

> A cytidine-free ribozyme with RNA ligase activity was obtained by in vitro evolution, starting from a pool of random-sequence RNAs that contained only guanosine, adenosine, and uridine. This ribozyme contains 74 nt and catalyzes formation of a 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage with a catalytic rate of 0.016 min(-1). The RNA adopts a simple secondary structure based on a three-way junction motif, with ligation occurring at the end of a stem region located several nucleotides away from the junction. Cytidine was introduced to the cytidine-free ribozyme in a combinatorial fashion and additional rounds of in vitro evolution were carried out to allow the molecule to adapt to this added component. The resulting cytidine-containing ribozyme formed a 3',5' linkage with a catalytic rate of 0.32 min(-1). The improved rate of the cytidine-containing ribozyme was the result of 12 mutations, including seven added cytidines, that remodeled the internal bulge loops located adjacent to the three-way junction and stabilized the peripheral stem regions.

397,The relationship between evolution and abiogenesis.,13,True,"User u/HighLocke has made a thread conflating the issue of abiogenesis with evolution. Specifically he asks ""How can you have evolution without abiogenesis?""

He's not the first creationist to make the claim that evolution is dependant on abiogenesis, to the point that we should reject evolution if abiogenesis cannot be proven.

So the question is, are evolution and abiogenesis related? The answer is yes, they most definitely are:

* They are both categorised under biology. Although some might argue that abiogenesis is more related to chemistry.
* They are both part of the natural history of Earth.
* They are both accepted by the majority of atheists, although a minority may believe in something like panspermia instead.

But evolution and abiogenesis being related does not mean what a lot of creationists claim; that evolution depends on abiogenesis.

I honestly wonder how creationists can come to that conclusion, because I've never heard a proper explanation for why that's the case. Indeed even the most cursory logic would show that evolution and abiogenesis are independant of each other.

Evolution states that a single common ancestor evolved into all life on Earth. What happened before that is completely irrelevant, as long as the end result was life existing. 

I do understand that creationism deals with the creation of life, so a discussion of the naturalistic origin of life is relevant to that discussion. But here's the problem: If you were to somehow disprove abiogenesis you are still left with 4 billion years of history that disagrees with creationism. Disproving abiogenesis isn't going to make all of that go away.

The whole argument does beg an interesting question: If disproving abiogenesis would disprove evolution, then does proving evolution prove abiogenesis? Can we prove that life formed naturally 4 billion years ago by investigating fossil hominids in the last 6 million years? Logically that must be the case if creationists are right about evolution depending on abiogenesis. Of course they're not right, and any rational mind knows that multiple theories and hypotheses can exist independently, and require independent lines of evidence.

Finally, the real reason creationists make this claim is obvious: They want it to be true. Really, that's it. It's as simple as it is wrong. They desperately want to intellectually justify their beliefs, and the easiest way to do that is to attack the weakest link, and pretend that brings the whole house of cards down.",1485650177,102,2017-01-28 19:36:17

414,Intelligent design qualifies as a scientific theory,0,True,"Intelligent design qualifies as a scientific theory

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2416-why-intelligent-design-qualifies-as-a-scientific-theory



Hypothesis (Prediction): Natural structures will be found that contain many parts arranged in intricate patterns, metabolic pathways similar to electronic circuits, sophisticated language and translation  systems,  indicating high levels of  Information,  and interdependence, like hard/software. No information, nor codes or ciphers ( translators ) can exist and will be found without an initial mental source, since information is, by its nature, a mental and not a material quantity. 

Observation: The genetic code system is a language , and the universal code is nearly optimal and maximally efficient ( only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the genetic code ).  Genomes use the genetic code to write two separate languages, beside a cipher, to translate codon triplets into a amino-acid ""alphabet"" constituent of 20 different left handed amino acids to make proteins.  One code describes how proteins are made, and the other instructs the cell on how genes are controlled and when expressed. There are 13 characteristics of human language. DNA shares 10 of them ( all LEVELS of Information: Statistics, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, Aprobatics are used )  This comparison between cell language and human language is not a loose analogy - it’s  literal. Human language and cell language both employ multilayered symbols to produce a blueprint - required to describe a artifact, and in biology, a organism. 

   DNA sequences that code for proteins need to convey, in addition to the protein-coding information, several different signals at the same time. These “parallel codes” include binding sequences for regulatory and structural proteins, signals for splicing, and RNA secondary structure. The universal genetic code can efficiently carry arbitrary parallel codes much better than the vast majority of other possible genetic codes. This property is related to the identity of the stop codons. We find that the ability to support parallel codes is strongly tied to another useful property of the genetic code—minimization of the effects of frame-shift translation errors. Whereas many of the known regulatory codes reside in nontranslated regions of the genome, the present findings suggest that protein-coding regions can readily carry abundant additional information. The output are thousands of essential proteins and enzymes required for life;   sophisticated molecular machinery is needed to replicate the code (for inheritance/perpetuation), transcribe it, translate it into protein with many intermediate steps requiring highly specific operations, and to repair it in the foreseen event that it is damaged (to preserve/protect it) or destroy it in the event that it suffers irreparable damage (to forestall cancer).  Beside the standard genetic code, other 23 genetic codes are known, beside epigenetic codes, that is, the Splicing Code, the Metabolic Code, the Signal Transduction Codes,  the Signal Integration Codes , the Histone Code,  the Tubulin Code, the Sugar Code, and the Glycomic Code, all essential to define a organism and phenotype. 

Experiment :
One language is written on top of the other, which is why the second language remained hidden for so long. Biologic systems and processes cannot be fully accounted for in terms of the principles and laws of physics and chemistry alone, but they require in addition the principles of semiotics—the science of symbols and signs, including linguistics.  Summarizing the state of the art in the study of the code evolution,  science cannot escape considerable skepticism. It seems that the two-pronged fundamental questions: “why is the genetic code the way it is and how did it come to be?”, that was asked over 50 years ago, at the dawn of molecular biology, might remain pertinent even in another 50 years, if methodological naturalism is adopted, and only natural explanations for its orgin are permitted. The consolation is that scientists cannot think of a more fundamental problem in biology. Despite extensive and, in many cases, elaborate attempts to model code optimization, ingenious theorizing along the lines of the coevolution theory, and considerable experimentation, very little definitive progress has been made.

 Intelligent agents  act frequently  with an end goal in mind, constructing  complex  multipart-machines, that require a blueprint to build the object. Furthermore, Computers   integrate  software/hardware and store  high levels of instructional complex coded information. In our experience, systems that either a) require or b) store  large amounts of specified / instructed complex information  such as codes and languages, and which are constructed in a interdependence of hard and software invariably originate from an intelligent source. No exception. There is a presence of an identical feature in both DNA and intelligently designed codes, languages, and artifacts. Because we know intelligent agents can (and do) produce complex and functionally specified sequences of symbols and arrangements of matter, intelligent agency qualifies as an adequate causal explanation for the origin of this effect. Since, in addition, materialistic theories have proven universally inadequate for explaining the origin of coded information and translation systems, intelligent causation  stands as the only entity with the causal power known to produce this feature of living systems. 

Falsification:  Nobody has yet been able to demonstrate naturally emerging informational systems based on codes and ciphers, and instructional information stored within these codes to produce a defined complex specified outcome. Perry Marshall, author of the book Evolution 2.0, has yet to pay the prize to someone that will come up and will meet the challenge.

 Natural Code LLC is a Private Equity Investment group formed to identify a naturally occurring code. Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize core principles of nature which give rise to information,  consciousness and intelligence. Natural Code LLC will pay the researcher $100,000 for the initial discovery of such a code. If the newly discovered process is defensibly patentable, we will secure the patent(s). Once patents are granted, we will pay the full prize amount to the discoverer in exchange for the rights. Our investment group will locate or develop commercial applications for the technology. The discoverer will retain a small percentage of ongoing ownership of the technology. Prize amount as of July 2016 is $3 million. The prize caps at $10 million.

Objection: Intelligent design is not science
Answer: Intelligent design  is falsifiable: any positive demonstration that instructional complex coded information as stored in DNA and epigenetic codes can easily be generated by non design mechanisms is a potential falsification of the ID theory

Objection: the evidence in the Dover trial disproves ID as a scientific theory
Answer: ask ANY real scientist, if he thinks the best way to proceed in scientific truth, is to have courts of law decide what scientific theories should be accepted.

Objection: Well, we don’t have another universe to compare ours to, and as Hume points out, that’s exactly the problem.
Answer: Its not a problem at all. We just need to define what distinguished designed objects from things that emerge randomly. 
1. High information content (or specified complexity) and irreducible complexity constitute strong indicators or hallmarks of (past) intelligent design.
2. Biological systems have a high information content (or specified complexity) and utilize subsystems that manifest irreducible complexity.
3. Naturalistic mechanisms or undirected causes do not suffice to explain the origin of information (specified complexity) or irreducible complexity.
4. Therefore, intelligent design constitutes the best explanations for the origin of information and irreducible complexity in biological systems.

There's no way to understand our earth, our universe or the ultimate meaning of anything. 5

When it comes to explain the possible mechanisms and  cause of origins, the physical universe,  life and biodiversity, usually three options are mentioned. Chance, physical necessity, and creation through the intelligence, will and power of a conscient agent. Lets give a closer look at the three options.

Chance. What kind of causal power has chance ? Chance expresses the odds or likelihood of a event  taking  place. Chance isn't a thing or a mechanism or a physical being or a causal agent. It's not a directing force. Chance doesn't make anything happen.  It's only a way to quantify the probability of a event taking place. But in modern thinking, chance is being transformed in the ingredient of evolution theory through random mutations, a causal ingredient of biodiversity. 2
Physical necessity is  the term that is given to the situation where something is forced to take a certain course of action. Events that are conditioned by some values, forces, laws , norms or goals.  In physics  the concept of necessity was applied  to cases of strict determination and restriction due to  so-called causal laws. Its the hypothesis that the constants and quantities had to have the values they do, so that the universe and the earth could not take any other course, than the one it did. 1,3 
Intelligent design/creation stands for guided, reason based , directed , planned , projected , programmed , information based,  goal-constrained, willed  causation by a conscient intelligent powerful eternal, non-caused agency. Chance and evolution could be a included mechanism in the intended goal, but that would in the end still be a intelligence-based process.

There are only these options when it comes to origins.  Either is there  a intelligent creator, or there is not. Those are the only  options.  If there is no God, then everything is a result of ..... what exactly ? 
Chance , as exposed above, isn't a thing. Physical necessity could only act  once a physical universe exists. Beyond the universe, there were no physical laws. 

Once its granted that no thing has no causal powers, its evident the universe could not have emerged from absolutely nothing. Nobody times nothing equals everything is irrational to the extreme ( nontheless, some very ""smart"" people think that proposition makes sense, and write extensive books about the subject ). Or, behind this complex universe is an incomprehensibly intelligent and powerful eternal being who made everything. 

Genesis 1:1 is unique in all literature, all science, and all philosophy.  Every other system of cosmogony explaining the universe, whether in ancient religious myths or modern scientific models, starts with eternal matter, or eternal energy in some form.  Only the book of Genesis starts with eternal God.  Genesis then is the book of the origin of the universe.

In Genesis we find the origin of order, information, and complexity.  There is order, there are physical laws that function of fixed rules, there is information, and there is life based on cells, that are equivalent to factories and complex irreducible machines.  Order , coded information and complexity never arise spontaneously.  They are always generated by a prior cause programmed to produce these things simultaneously. 

We also find in Genesis the origin of life, the marvels of the reproductive process.  The almost infinite complexity programmed into the genetic system of plants and animals are inexplicable apart from special creation by a great, supernatural, powerful intelligence.

Genesis tells us about the origin of man, the most highly organized and complex entity in the universe, the origin of marriage,  the remarkable universal and stable institution of marriage as having been ordained by the Creator; the origin of evil.  The origin of physical and moral evil in the universe is explained in Genesis as a kind of temporary intrusion into God's perfect world, allowed by God as a concession to the principle of human freedom and responsibility and also to manifest Himself as Redeemer of sinners as well as Creator. In the book of Genesis you find the origin of salvation by grace through God's mercy and a substitute.  That's all in Genesis and it starts to show as God is merciful to Adam and Eve and doesn't kill them, even though they deserved to die for their sin.  In the book of Genesis that we find the origin of language. How you go from apes to man not just making some physical transition, but developing language, how you go from grunting and making unintelligible noises to human speech. is unexplained by modern science as well. The gulf between the mindless, instinctive chattering of animals and the intelligent, abstract, symbolic communication of man is absolutely and completely unbridgeable by any evolutionary process. You find in Genesis the origin of culture.  You find here such things as urbanization, the development of metallurgy, music, agriculture, animal husbandry, writing, education, navigation, textiles and ceramics.  All of that starts in the book of Genesis. You find in the book of Genesis the origin of religion.  Both the true religion and false religions appear, first of all, in the book of Genesis. 

Science knows nothing about origins. No wonder, when pressed hard, the last outcome most atheists come up with , is ignorance. We don't know yet. Science is working on it. 

Open questions in biology, biochemistry, and evolution

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2299-open-questions-in-biology-biochemistry-and-evolution

When methodological naturalism is applied, the only explanation for the origin of life is abiogenesis, and of biodiversity, Darwins Theory of evolution. Proponents repeat like a mantra : Evolution is a fact. If that were the case, there would exist far more convincing , clear scientific answers to  almost all relevant scientific questions and issues. This is far from being the case. Based on scientific papers, quite a different picture arises. Instead of compelling answers, questionmarks and lack of understanding, generalized ignorance in regard of almost all relevant issues,  and conceptual problems are the most common. Since the information is widely sparse and scattered amongst thousands of scientific papers, its not so evident that this is the factual state of matter. The general public is duped by effect slogans, that give the false impression of certainty of naturalism. The standard answer, when proponents of naturalism are confronted with this situation, is: ""We are working on it"". Or: ""We don't know yet"". 

Objection: more possible causal mechanisms exist, maybe even a infinity. 
Answer: What can be asserted without evidence, can be discarted without evidence. 

Objection:the universe isn't obliged in any to conform to our model of reality. Just look at Einstein's relativity theories. They demonstrate that the universe can confound us.  That justifies not become attached to any viewpoint. 
Answer: Even if a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is not fully understood, the possible mechanisms to explain our existence are still the same.

So far, I've been  breezing through the stupid crap this brochure presents as reason to ""doubt"" the theory of evolution. One sentence, however, is so seemingly ridiculous that I want another set of eyes to confirm.


Under the section ""Evolution- Myths and Facts"", the writer heavily cites an article from the October 1991 issue of *Scientific American*.


The writer of the brochure states this exactly:

""They also noticed that some of the different “species” of finches were interbreeding and producing offspring that survived better than the parents. They concluded that if the interbreeding continued, it could result in the fusion of two “species” into just one.""


The writer than uses this statement to (rightfully) question the validity of the term species. Here's the thing, though- *The SA article NEVER says what the writer claims.*


Page 87 of the magazine is cited, to be specific. [Here's a group of screenshots showcasing the entire article so you can, as I bothered to do, read the whole thing if you wish.](http://imgur.com/a/0MYOL)


Does the article ever suggest cross-species mating? As far as I can tell, it does not.


EDIT: I've realized that there were actually multiple articles cited *including* the one I linked, which is why I couldn't foind anything about interbreeding. I'm beginning to understand why interbreeding doesn't matter anyways.",1484943435,7,2017-01-20 15:17:15
419,Is there enough time?,5,True,"I'm just going to preface this with the fact that I am an undergrad studying plant biology. I wholeheartedly accept science, evolution, and I'm just asking a simple question about time.

Given that human beings have roughly 125 mutations in their genome different than either parent is 3.8 billion years of life enough time for the diversity we see to occur? I mean given that sexual reproduction only occurred 1.2 billion years ago and before that mutation rates were much much lower is there enough time for the monumentous number of changes and speciation to occur? 

I'm currently taking an evolution class and we were talking about the mutation of an allele in mice that produces a dark coat compared to a sandy one. Based on the mutation rate, population, and generational time frame it would only take 1000 years for this mutation to occur naturally and just braking down the math that 3.8 billion/1000 = 3.8 million mutations. In the lifetime of the planet for this particular gene.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2413-why-do-atheists-try-to-justify-their-unbelief-in-god



Why do atheists all the time ask for empirical proofs for Gods existence ? If you lack belief in a deity, yet spend tons of time debating people who DO believe in God and seeking to shoot holes in their  beliefs, does this mean they  are seeking to find God in a roundabout way (desiring to be persuaded)? Or does it mean that they think they are justifying in their non-belief  and making themself feel better and more warranted / justified to disbelieve in God by shooting down the believers in a creator ? 1

A common argument is that there is no evidence or proof for Gods existence, and what cannot be backed up with evidence, can be dismissed without evidence. 
Whatever couldn’t be proven or disproven was in the  “realm of fiction or hallucinations.... . But why the demand that proponents of intelligent design / creationism must produce empirical conclusive proofs for Gods existence, as if that is the be-all and end-all of all epistemological inquiry? Often, when i ask atheists, what evidence would convince them that design explains best the origin of what is observed in the natural world, they give no answer. Truth said, most of them never thought about the question. What would they consider good or compelling evidence and how would they define what is evidence of design in nature ? The question they must answer is : “what evidence would you find compelling?” 

There is a huge body of work from many serious thinkers arguing the theistic God; there is no such body of work painstakingly arguing in favor of Santa Claus (i.e., the mythical figure), the tooth fairy, leprechauns, unicorns, mermaids. That’s why the theistic claim is a lot more credible.

It is much more plausible that the universe came about by the causal agency of God than by self-causation or random chance. We should accept the claims by virtue of the demands of rationality and plausibility, by which we also determine whether anything else is true.

Its pointless to ask for proofs. Thats on the lowest level of a atheism - theism debate, reserved to the ones that have no education in philosophy and science.

421,Biosynthesis o Amino Acids,0,True,"Biosynthesis o Amino Acids

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1397-biosynthesis-o-amino-acids

Could the oxygen and nitrogen cicle be explained by naturalistic means ? The reason for the abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere is the presence of a very large number of organisms which produce oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae became the first microbes to produce oxygen by photosynthesis. They are one of the oldest bacteria that live on earth, said to exist perhaps as long  as 3.5 billion years. And their capabilities are nothing more than astounding.  No cianobacteria, no oxygen, no higher life forms. These cianobacterias have incredibly sophisticated enzyme proteins and metabolic pathways, like the electron transport chains, ATP synthase motors, circadian clock, the photosynthetic light reactions, carbon concentration mechanism, and transcriptional regulation , they produce binded nitrogen through nitrogenase, a highly sophisticated mechanism to bind nitrogen, used as a nutrient for plant and animal growth.

The Nitrogen cycle is a lot more complex than the carbon cycle. Nitrogen is a very important element. It makes up almost 80% of our atmosphere, and it is an important component of proteins and DNA, both of which are the building blocks of animals and plants. Therefore without nitrogen we would lose one of the most important elements on this planet, along with oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. There are a number of stages to the nitrogen cycle, which involve breaking down and building up nitrogen and it’s various compounds.There is no real starting point for the nitrogen cycle. It is an endless cycle. Potential gaps in the system cannot be reasonably bypassed by inorganic nature alone. It must have a degree of specificity that in all probability could not have been produced by chance.

A given function or step in the system may be found in several different unrelated organisms. The removal of any one of the individual biological steps will resort in the loss of function of the system. The data suggest that the nitrogen cycle may be irreducibly interdependent based on the above criteria. No proposed neo-Darwinian mechanisms can explain the origin of such a system.The ultimate source of nitrogen for the biosynthesis of amino acids is atmospheric nitrogen (N2), a nearly inert gas. Its needed by all living things to build proteins and nucleic acids. This is one of the hardest chemical bonds of all to break. So, how can nitrogen be brought out of its tremendous reserves in the atmosphere and into a state where it can be used by living things? 

To be metabolically useful, atmospheric nitrogen must be reduced. It must be converted to a useful form. Without ""fixed"" nitrogen, plants, and therefore animals, could not exist as we know them. This process, known as nitrogen fixation, occurs through lightening, but most  in certain types of bacteria, namely cianobacteria. Even though nitrogen is one of the most prominent chemical elements in living systems, N2 is almost unreactive (and very stable) because of its triple bond (N≡N). This bond is extremely difficult to break because the three chemical bonds need to be separated and bonded to different compounds. Nitrogenase is the only family of enzymes capable of breaking this bond (i.e., it carries out nitrogen fixation). Nitrogenase is a very complex enzyme system. Nitrogenase genes are distributed throughout the prokaryotic kingdom, including representatives of the Archaea as well as the Eubacteria and Cyanobacteria.With assistance from an energy source (ATP) and a powerful and specific complementary reducing agent (ferredoxin), nitrogen molecules are bound and cleaved with surgical precision.

In this way, a ‘molecular sledgehammer’ is applied to the NN bond, and a single nitrogen molecule yields two molecules of ammonia. The ammonia then ascends the ‘food chain’, and is used as amino groups in protein synthesis for plants and animals. This is a very tiny mechanism, but multiplied on a large scale it is of critical importance in allowing plant growth and food production on our planet to continue. ‘Nature is really good at it (nitrogen-splitting), so good in fact that we've had difficulty in copying chemically the essence of what bacteria do so well.’ If one merely substitutes the name of God for the word 'nature', the real picture emerges.These proteins use a collection of metal ions as the electron carriers that are responsible for the reduction of N2 to NH3. All organisms can then use this reduced nitrogen (NH3) to make amino acids. In humans, reduced nitrogen enters the physiological system in dietary sources containing amino acids. One thing is certain—that matter obeying existing laws of chemistry could not have created, on its own, such a masterpiece of chemical engineering.Without cyanobacteria - no fixed nitrogen is available.Without fixed nitrogen, no DNA, no amino-acids, no protein can be synthesised. Without DNA, no amino-acids,protein, or cyanobacteria are possible. So thats a interdependent system.",1484784141,50,2017-01-18 19:02:21

428,Can god/a creator count to infinity? x-post from /r/debatecreation,1,True,"One of the common arguments I hear against evolution is that the universe had to have a creator because the universe can't be infinitely old. First of all, this line of reasoning makes no sense because the big bang isn't related to evolution. Secondly, even with a creator we would still have the same problem.

 

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5mgp6h/how_you_can_provide_a_better_world_view_based_on/) mentioned the argument:

""or if we propose that the universe is eternal in any kind of form, like a multiverse, oscillating universe etc. , and had no beginning, how we can reach the present from eternity. If we add one event after the other starting now, whenever we stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. How can we then reach now from ( past ) eternity by adding one event after the other ?""

 

But even with a god, or creator, or intelligent designer we run into the exact same problem.

 

Every time the origin of the universe is brought up, especially Kalam style, god or the creator or the intelligent designer is almost always said to be timeless. Eternal. Existing outside of time. This is done, I believe, for two reasons. First, to find a way to avoid the ""everything had to have a cause"" argument by placing something outside of the rules, and secondly to give us that mythical exception to the rule that ""makes it all work."" However it doesn't work.

 

How long did this timeless force wait to start the universe? Oh wait, it is ""outside of time"" so it can be infinite/eternal. The problem is if you are outside of time, 1 second, and 1 planck, and  a googleplex of millennia are all equal. If you don't experience time, you have no frame of reference. So how many infinitely long eternities did this creating force exist by itself before deciding to create something?

 

Logically speaking, from my point of view at least, if something did exist ""outside of time"" its entire existence, no matter how infinite it is, would necessarily be simultaneous. Again, without having a way to separate a second from a year or a millennia everything that being or force did would have to be simultaneous, because to exist ""outside of time"" is to exist outside of causality. So there is no logical way for an outside timeless cause to be the start of our universe because it would have to have caused the universe as soon as it began to exist otherwise it could never have gotten around to creating the universe at all, which would make the universe as eternal as the outside force. And if the universe has to be eternal because of the outside force, we agree the universe can be eternal and thus can save a step by saying the universe is eternal without need of a outside cause.",1484047406,19,2017-01-10 06:23:26

430,How you can provide a better world view based on naturalism/strong atheism over a proponent of creationism / intelligent design,0,True,"How you can provide a better world view based on naturalism/strong atheism over a proponent of creationism / intelligent design

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2407-how-you-can-provide-a-better-world-view-based-on-naturalism-strong-atheism-over-a-proponent-of-creationism-intelligent-design



Positive or strong atheism proposes  that ( most probably ) no deities exist. If we held that position, and that adequate answers exist which top creationism/intelligent design in explanatory power without the need for a powerful intelligent creative agency, we are at least going to have to provide sufficient positive compelling explanations based on philosophical naturalism, which points to the fact that the natural world can have a origin by its own, without the need of a God.  Some things happen because of an intelligent agency, some things don't.  Materialists don't believe in agency at all. So , how can this view be backed up rationally ?  

This view implies that we need good answers of how absolutely nothing magically can turn  into a Big Bang and life supporting universe and create the physical laws simultaneously, or if we propose that the universe is eternal in any kind of form, like a multiverse, oscillating universe etc. , and had no beginning,  how we can reach the present from eternity. If we add one event after the other starting now, whenever we stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. How can we then reach now from ( past ) eternity by adding one event after the other ? Furthermore, we have to explain how the second law of thermodynamics would be overcome. 

Then, its required that we  give good reasons of how random unguided forces  finetuned sucessfully the expansion of the Big Bang out of 10^120 attempts and possibilities ( thats a 10 with 120 zeroes ) , the four fundamental forces like gravity, which strength  is finely tuned to a precision of  one of 14 billion billion billion settings, and hundreds of physical parameters, and the conditions to permit life on earth. Its not that life adapted to the universe. The parameters had to be finely tuned right from the start;  If not, no universe could exist at all .  How life can emerge from non-life and produce  cells ? 

The cell is an interdependent functional city. We state, “The cell is the most detailed and concentrated organizational structure known to humanity. It is a lively microcosmic city, with factories for making building supplies, packaging centers for transporting the supplies, trucks that move the materials along highways, communication devices, hospitals for repairing injuries, a massive library of information, power stations providing usable energy, garbage removal, walls for protection and city gates for allowing certain materials to come and go from the cell.” The notion of the theoretical first cell arising by natural causes is a perfect example of irreducibly complexity. Life cannot exist without many numerous interdependent complex systems, each irreducibly complex on their own, working together to bring about a grand pageant for life to exist.

How could cells emerge through unguided, accidental random events, and luck was able to create  the storage device of information in DNA, transcription and translation machinery inside cells , invent a optimal genetic code, better and less error prone than one million alternatives, a translation system ( a genetic cipher, that equals to translation from english to chinese ) , and incalculable amount of precise instructions to create the first  self-replicating cell with a minimal number of precisely dimensioned and fitting parts, precise energy supply where needed for various chemical reactions, a error check and repair system all along the cellular processes, and  millions of amazingly diverse species with the ability to evolve and adapt to the environment, and explain the emergence of conscient intelligent minds from inanimated  matter. Furthermore, we have to give good reasons why it could be justified in exeptional circumstances  to torture, rape and kill little babies for fun. If we can't, we would grant that absolute, objective moral values exist. Since they are prescriptive, we would have to grant the existence of a moral giver or moral code prescriber above us.

We can also not afford us to commit the logical fallacy to make affirmative conclusions based on a negative premise. This illicit negative  occurs when a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion, but one or two negative premises. We need to be able to present and adopt a well-articulated, thorough-going positive world view based on positive evidence that results in good reasons to infer naturalism. What we have to present, is a positive case for  strong atheism by reference to the evidence that favours a naturalistic  interpretation of reality. Asking to provide positive, compelling evidence that points to the fact that the natural world can have a origin by its own, is not the same as to ask for evidence that God does not exist. If we are going to argue that adequate answers exist without the need for a creative intelligent powerful agency with will, we are at least going to have to provide sufficient naturalistic explanations.",1483741967,81,2017-01-06 17:32:47

432,Wanna Build a Cell? A DVD Player Might Be Easier,0,True,"http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2404-wanna-build-a-cell-a-dvd-player-might-be-easier

Wanna Build a Cell? A DVD Player Might Be Easier Imagine that you’re building the world’s first DVD player. What must you have before you can turn it on and watch a movie for the first time?

A DVD. How do you get a DVD? You need a DVD recorder first. How do you make a DVD recorder? First you have to define the language. When Russell Kirsch (who we met in chapter Cool created the world’s first digital image, he had to define a language for images first. Likewise you have to define the language that gets written on the DVD, then build hardware that speaks that language. Language must be defined first. Our DVD recorder/player problem is an encoding-decoding problem, just like the information in DNA. You’ll recall that communication, by definition, requires four things to exist:

1. A code
2. An encoder that obeys the rules of a code
3. A message that obeys the rules of the code
4. A decoder that obeys the rules of the code

These four things—language, transmitter of language, message, and receiver of language—all have to be precisely defined in advance before any form of communication can be possible at all.



A camera sends a signal to a DVD recorder, which records a DVD. The DVD player reads the DVD and converts it to a TV signal. This is conceptually identical to DNA translation. The only difference is that we don’t know how the original signal—the pattern in the first DNA strand—was encoded. The first DNA strand had to contain a plan to build something, and that plan had to get there somehow. An original encoder that translates the idea of an organism into instructions to build the organism (analogous to the camera) is directly implied.

The rules of any communication system are always defined in advance by a process of deliberate choices. There must be prearranged agreement between sender and receiver, otherwise communication is impossible. By definition, a communication system cannot evolve from something simpler because evolution itself requires communication to exist first. You can’t make copies of a message without the message, and you can’t create a message without first having a language. And before that, you need intent. A code is an abstract, immaterial, nonphysical set of rules. There is no physical law that says ink on a piece of paper formed in the shape T-R-E-E should correspond to that large leafy organism in your front yard. You cannot derive the local rules of a code from the laws of physics, because hard physical laws necessarily exclude choice. On the other hand, the coder decides whether “1” means “on” or “off.” She decides whether “0” means “off” or “on.” Codes, by definition, are freely chosen. The rules of the code come before all else. These rules of any language are chosen with a goal in mind: communication, which is always driven by intent. That being said, conscious beings can evolve a simple code into a more complex code—if they can communicate in the first place. But even simple grunts and hand motions between two humans who share no language still require communication to occur. Pointing to a table and making a sound that means “table” still requires someone to recognize what your pointing finger means.

434,"Evolutionist, how do you view this?",0,True,"They did present a lot of 'science' but they also presented so many half-truths to border on lying for them to present ToE as scientific knowledge that is widely accepted. The show most certainly would have appeared very convincing to one not educated in biological sciences. For one thing they proposed the evolution of legs from a fish that was trying to escape being eaten by another fish. The problem is that for this to be factual, the organism would have had to develop fully functional legs in the water for them to offer any advantage and another thing is that this 'walking fish' would have had to simultaneously develop the capability to breathe air through lungs and not by filtering oxygen from water through gills. Neither did they present the example of the Mudskipper fish that exists today as an apparent missing link in the evolution chain. If evolution works to develop new species, why does this 'missing link' still exist?

My perspective is that evolutionists go too far in how much they claim ToE adequately explains the origin of different species. Horses and donkeys are very similar and they produce a viable, but sterile mule. The horse and donkey differ in chromosomal number due to a Robertsonian fusion that results in abnormal chromosomal pairing in meiosis and near complete male sterility. In order for this fused chromosome to become homozygous then two individuals with exactly the same mutation must find and mate with each other. 

For argument sake, let's say the frequency of a fusion is 1 in 1,000. Now, a horse has 32 pairs of chromosomes and a donkey has 31 pairs. Assuming a random occurrence of fusions there are 496 permutations of all possible combinations. Therefore the frequency of an individual with a particular fusion would be 1 in 496,000. The frequency of a male and a female each with a particular fused chromosome is 1/496,0000 X 1/496,000 = 1/246 billion. Now that doesn't sound so terribly bad, but consider that the original male and female would have to be heterozygous for the mutation and therefore almost certainly sterile due to the aforementioned abnormal chromosome pairing in meiosis. Let's say the male is 1% fertile and the female is 10% fertile (due to spermatogenesis being more sensitive to aberrations) which means 1/1,000 such matings would produce an offspring. Now we are down to a probability of 1 in 246 trillion, but wait we are not through yet. When two heterozygous (each carry a normal + mutant chromosome) individuals mate only 1 in 4 offspring are homozygous for the mutation. Now we are down to 1 in roughly 1 quadrillion (10 to the 15th power) to get a single individual that is homozygous for the mutation. What about getting two individuals that are homozygous for the mutation finding each other and mating? Well that is 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 X 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 = 0.000000000000000000000000000001. Needless to say, but there most certainly haven't ever been that many horse-like matings in all of history. You may argue that with enough time even this ridiculously low probability will become a certainty, but for me it is so close to zero that for all reasonably practical purposes the probability IS ZERO. (BTW you are welcome to point out any errors in my calculations.)",1483124014,29,2016-12-30 13:53:34
435,Do creationists not understand that scientists are not emotionally attached to evolution?,17,True,"When reading things that creationists post online, I get the impression that they have no idea why scientists ""believe"" in evolution. Either they think there is some sort of conspiracy within the scientific community or scientists cling to evolution as a sort of faith. 


But scientists are not emotionally attached to the idea of evolution like creationists are emotionally attached to the idea of God creating everything. Scientists do not ""care"" about evolution, it is simply the best-fitting explanation for the data we have. They have no reason to be biased against evidence that contradicts evolution.


Scientists do not want to waste their time studying something that is false. If someone out there genuinely had a thoughtful, reasoned argument against evolution that had sufficient evidentiary support, then scientists would absolutely **love** to hear about it. I mean this whole-heartedly. Someone who could disprove evolution would become a scientific hero. The discovery would be a historical breakthrough and the person responsible would be immortalized just like Charles Darwin is now. 


This is why talking with creationists is so frustrating. Scientists would love to engage in a thoughtful, nuanced critique of their findings, but instead they are simply bombarded by basic, low-hanging fruit questions like *""If humans evolved from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys?""* 


That's the kind of question that shows you have never even once read a single article or book about the topic. You're arguing against one of the world's most ill-constructed straw-men. Come up with better arguments and people might start taking you more seriously. 


There is no agenda to silence you or exclude you. You just need to understand that scientists are not playing on an emotional or spiritual battlefield and attacking evolution / scientists on that front will not do any good.

____

**Discovery:**

 

The ApoA-1 Milano mutation was found by University of Milan researchers after their 1974 investigation of a low HDL / high triglyceride phenotype exhibited by Valerio Dagnoli of Limone sul Garda, a small village in northern Italy. Limone had only 1,000 inhabitants at the time and when blood tests were run on the entire population of the village, the mutation was found to be present in about 3.5% of the local population.

The mutation was traced to one man, Giovanni Pomarelli, who lived in the village in the late 18th century and passed it on to his offspring.

[The paper describing the method to identify patient zero.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1684746/)

It is characterised by the replacement of arginine by cysteine at position 173.

[The paper describing the exact amino acid change.](http://www.jbc.org/content/258/4/2508.full.pdf+html)


___

**Efficacy:**

 

ApoA1 Milano was first identified by Dr. Cesare Sirtori in Milan, who also demonstrated that its presence significantly reduced cardiovascular disease, even though it caused a reduction in HDL levels and an increase in triglyceride levels.

Apo A-I Milano has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in animal models and in a small phase 2 human trial. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) mediated Apo A-I Milano gene therapy in combination with low-cholesterol diet induces rapid and significant regression of atherosclerosis in mice.

Due to its enormous apparent efficacy, some have speculated that development of synthetic ApoA-1 Milano may be a key factor in eradicating coronary heart disease.

Esperion Therapeutics, a high tech venture capital start-up, demonstrated proof of efficacy in both animals and humans, spending many millions of dollars over several years to conduct a single human trial which showed impressive and rapid efficacy by IVUS of coronary arteries.",1482861495,100,2016-12-27 12:58:15
438,Video: How Neural Networks Actually Work || Geoffrey Hinton - Google's A.I. Chief,0,True,"Towards the end Geoffrey discusses big improvements having been made to traditional (neural RAM) ""neural network"" models by guessing which words will work in a (vocal motor system) sentence. A neural network addresses the information as he explains, in a hierarchy that goes from individual pixels on up to a ""percept"". 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvQlrvmD0AU

This is further evidence that the ID Lab model tested operational definition used in the [Theory of Intelligent Design](http://theoryofid.blogspot.com/) is true.

> Behavior from a system or a device qualifies as intelligent by meeting all four circuit requirements that are required for this ability, which are: (1) A body to control, either real or virtual, with motor muscle(s) including molecular actuators, motor proteins, speakers (linear actuator), write to a screen (arm actuation), motorized wheels (rotary actuator). It is possible for biological intelligence to lose control of body muscles needed for movement yet still be aware of what is happening around itself but this is a condition that makes it impossible to survive on its own and will normally soon perish. (2) Random Access Memory (RAM) addressed by its sensory sensors where each motor action and its associated confidence value are stored as separate data elements. (3) Confidence (central hedonic) system that increments the confidence level of successful motor actions and decrements the confidence value of actions that fail to meet immediate needs. (4) Ability to guess a new memory action when associated confidence level sufficiently decreases. For flagella powered cells a random guess response is designed into the motor system by the reversing of motor direction causing it to “tumble” towards a new heading.

In the ID Lab model each of the RAM data locations is a separate ""percept"" that is addressed by serializing the sensory bits to a unique number/percept that can be read from, or written to by guessing a new motor action to try. Where there are only 7 bits of red, green and blue information and what is seen in the environment is not overly complex there is no need for as many layers of neurons as in our cerebral cortex, which is for sorting out a much larger amount of visual information into a single percept. 

Knowing how this relates to the four requirement operational definition (for obligatory theory of operation explaining how the ID Lab model works) should make it easy to understand what he is saying. You'll know what much of the jargon boils down to and where ""Neural Networks"" of the future are going. This is not something a science journal reviewer can give you. This is your personally being able to understand what this video is saying as it relates to the ID Lab models where the same is true.

440,Want more macroevolution? How about a plasmid becoming a virus?,17,True,"Before we start, some vocabulary:

Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA common in bacteria. They replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome, and often carry important genes. Antibiotic resistance and genes for conjugation are often found on plasmids, for example.

Geminiviruses are small, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that infect plants. They have two main genes.

The CP is the gene for the coat or capsid protein. That's the ""shell"" of the virus.

The Rep gene codes for the Rep protein, which is basically a ""copy me"" signal for the host cell. 

 

Geminiviruses are the result of a plasmid (which have Rep genes) acquiring a CP gene from an RNA virus. We know this because their CP sequences are nested within the phylogeny for RNA viruses, while their Rep sequences are not related to any other viral Reps, at least not closely. Their closest relatives are the Reps of certain types of plasmids. 

 

Since viruses, transposable elements, and plasmids all fall under the umbrella of ""mobile genetic elements,"" and horizontal gene transfer between mobile genetic elements is a common occurrence, the best explanation is that a plasmid, with its Rep gene, acquired a CP gene from a virus infecting the same cell. With that acquisition, that plasmid became a virus. 

 

How's that for macroevolution? Or is this just evolution ""within kinds""?

441,Frauds like Piltdown Man vindicate evolution.,12,True,"Piltdown Man faced harsh criticism outside the UK immediately following its publication in 1915, particularly from French and American scientists. The American Museum of Natural History, in fact, refused to display the specimen as a single species. The exhibit was instead described as an assortment of fossilized human and chimpanzee remains, just as it was later discovered to be. 

It's not surprising that the specimen initially seemed to fit as the heralded ‘missing link’, it was, after all, specifically manufactured for this exact purpose. However, in the years following its ‘discovery’, while no one suspected outright fraud, Piltdown Man did become increasingly more difficult to explain. It did not fit into anyone's cladistic or phylogenetic models of common descent, nor did it seem possible for it to be a natural offshoot. It was as if someone had just unearthed a “crocoduck”, impossible from an evolutionary perspective and obviously not related to any other form of life known to have ever existed.  

The specimen was eventually shelved in hopes that it could, someday, be explained, and there it sat, out of sight and all but forgotten. Meanwhile, the scientific community moved on without Piltdown Man, the one piece of the puzzle that didn't seem to fit anywhere. Far from being the ‘crown jewel’ of evolution, as some creationists would like to paint it, it was, instead, evolution’s biggest nightmare. A curious anomaly. An outlier inexplicable by any data that was currently available, and the one fly that everyone tried to ignore in their soup bowl. 

By 1950, the chemical testing, we now consider standard, had just become available, and it was thought that perhaps a more modern examination of Piltdown Man may shed some light on its mysterious place in prehistory. The specimen was dug out of storage and once again saw the light of day for the first time in decades. 

Modern methods of dating and chemical analysis revealed, with almost trivial simplicity, that the bones had been faked. While relatively few openly expected this to be the case, this was practically the least surprising finding that could have been made. By this time our understanding of phylogeny had become complete enough that literally any other finding would have been a major upset to someone's research. The faking of the specimen, while understandably shocking to the entire scientific community, was the one solution that made sense to everyone. It caused almost no debate, no academic upheaval and the scientific world collectively breathed a sigh of relief. 

Errors, such as Nebraska Man, all tell a similar story, in that case the discoverer himself being the first to realize and openly admit his own mistake. In the case of real legitimate science, such as the theory of evolution, it's the errors and fakes that stand apart from the data and contradict the theoretical models, and, in nearly every case, are all but dismissed long before they are confirmed to be fraudulent. Once they are confirmed to be false, they are no longer upheld by any significant group of supporters. They're dismissed, forgotten and buried. 

Pseudoscientific woo woo, on the other hand, stubbornly clings to, and continues to propagate, ridiculous findings such as the Shroud of Turin and the discovery of Noah's Ark for decades even after they are thoroughly debunked. Pop cultural beliefs that support a creationist worldview, such as “humans use only 10% of their brains”, “there is no junk DNA”, “scientists continually find functions for structures thought to be vestigial” or “speciation had never been observed”, persist despite having no basis in reality. More academic pursuits, such as ‘flood geology’ and ‘irreducible complexity’, continue to be touted as legitimate fields of study even after having been proven conclusively to have no value outside of apologetics.

443,What proponents of naturalism must explain,0,True,"If proponents of naturalism are going to argue that adequate answers exist without the need of a creator/intelligent designer, they are at least going to have to provide sufficient naturalistic explanations and reasons that top theism. By that i mean positive, compelling evidence that points to the fact that the natural world is self sufficient, and can have a origin by its own. They need good answers of how absolutely nothing magically can turn into something, or if they propose that the universe is eternal, and had no beginning, how we can reach now from eternity. If you add one event after the other starting now, whenever you stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. You cannot reach eternity by adding one event after the other. Thats why there cannot be a past eternity, otherwise we would never reach now.

Then the naturalist has to give good reasons of how randomness finetuned the expansion of the Big Bang, the fundamental forces, and hundreds of physical parameters, and the conditions to permit life on earth, how life can emerge from non-life through unguided, lucky events, and randomness was able to create the storage device, transcription and translation machinery , invent a optimal genetic code, translation code, and incalculable amount of precise instructions to create the first irreducible complex self-replicating cell, and millions of amazingly diverse species with the ability to evolve, and explain the emergence of conscient intelligent minds from inanimated matter ( quantum mechanics supports the idea that conscience/mind predates, and permeates all physical being.

444,How To Propose and Test Fly a Bold New Scientific Theory,0,True,"As with Phrenology theory: theories can be false, as well as true. Never ever should the word ""theory"" or the having been written by ""theorists"" be thought of as necessarily indicating that it has been tested to be true.

It is thus possible for a scientific theory to beforehand be proposed, then later developed. This is what the Discovery Institute did by stating *""The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""* then inviting scientists to help develop the theory that the premise describes. It's an idea you can test (hypothesis) that tests true by development of a theory that does not pertain to ""natural selection"" and explains how (what standard scientific naming convention would have to call) ""intelligent cause"" works, which in turn explains what happened.

Where enough people are passionate they will keep trying anything, until a breakthrough happens. That's what just happened for the ID movement. In fact the ID theory predicts that where there are a whole lot of best guesses being tried where confidence being true is tested the result is collective intelligence that learns new knowledge from old. Regardless of testing true or false: all hypotheses are equally valuable, blessed.

Kathy Martin helped bring to life an evo-word free science classroom demonstration introducing self-assembly to her peers (science teachers) while at the same time making it a mixing salad oil simple thing not something that needs evolution to explain. Spinoffs from the noisy public hearing for the ""theory of intelligent design"" made the whole thing worthwhile. Jack Krebs and others from KCFS can be proud for networking in help some of the best scientists in the world.

To be credible in science and engineering it's necessary for me to separate ID from religious arguments from creationism. But that's what BioLogos does for Darwinian theory, which contains the ""natural selection"" variable. As long as science is not (in favor of religious answers) neglected: it is OK to be religious about ID theory. Here's an example from me, by my use of a creative illustration pointer:

https://sites.google.com/site/intelligenceprograms/Home/Causation.GIF

The ID controversy has shown that ahead of time proposing then presenting for testing a theory like this can lead to great scientific benefit. And science has a way of in return making dreams come true, in ways you never could have beforehand dreamed of. What in time develops is way better but it can at first be hard to know what to make of it. Once the shock of things not normally turning out exactly as expected is over comes the realization that the walls you/we built within come/came tumbling down and a new world will begin. The theory that makes childhood dreams come true is finally safe, free to fly, and in turn without fear so are we. You made it here too:

This is my first post to reddit, so please have a little mercy on me.
 I am an atheist who has currently been debating a Theist friend of mine just about every time we see each other. He claims that Michael Behe, author of ""Darwin's Black Box"", has presented evolutionists with an insurmountable challenge; namely, that of irreducible complexity.
I did some research, and came to the conclusion that Behe's argument is simply a new spin on the argument from design. However, my friend did raise one interesting point. In discussion of the irreducible complexity of the bacterial flagellum, I referred him to a paper titled ""The Flagellum Unspun"", in which the bacterial flagellum is demonstrated to not be irreducibly complex. If 10 proteins are removed, the flagellum can still function as the Type III Secretory Apparatus. My friend's response to this was rather interesting. He claimed that the flagellum is still irreducibly complex, as the removal of a single protein would render it non-functional. He claimed that 10 proteins being removed was not a refutation of Behe's definition of Irreducible Complexity, and actually supported it. In his mind, there would need to be 10 simultaneous genetic mutations to go from the Type III Secretory Apparatus to the Bacterial Flagellum, and that this was further proof of Intelligent Design. He asked me to find an organism in which a single protein, and only a single protein, had been removed from the flagellum, and that still had a function.

452,"What happens when a creationist thinks they understand biology..,",4,True,"""Have you noticed that in recent years, new ideas in biology such as these have been proposed? Why is that? Because the traditional Neo-Darwinian mechanisms have failed to produce the kind of evolution that is assumed to have occurred. While endosymbiosis and HGT are interesting concepts, they don’t conquer the problem of accumulating significant genetic information by mutations. They just push it back. Think about it.



First of all, the scientists studying the amoeba Paulinella, have not witnessed the chromatophore incorporating in to the organism. They have assumed that this is the case. What they then do is look for evidence that this has indeed occurred. From the outset, this is circular reasoning. They make an assumption then set out to find evidence that supports the assumption. Whether that evidence is strong or weak will depend on the initial assumptions and bias of the researchers.

Let’s say for the sake of argument that this organism, Paulinella does indeed have an exceptionally well matched organelle to that of cyanobacteria…a plastid. What is the implication? Does it discern between various theories? No, it is predicted by either. In this case intelligent design theory also fits the evidence. Design is the purposeful use of common parts. 
 

Think about the implication of Paulinella acquiring an organelle through endosymbiosis. It would be a leap in genetic information for the amoeba, but of information that has already been “built”. The problem of accumulating genetic information through random mutation is not solved, only pushed back. The information for a functioning amoeba still needs to be built. The complex information for a chromatophore in the cyanobacteria  still had to “mutate” into existence  in the first place. Has this been demonstrated as possible? No. 

You might want to do some further reading to more critically analyze endosymbiosis . 

http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/backgrounder-some-challenges-offered-for-lynn-marguliss-endosymbiosis-theory/

  Endosymbiosis is undoubtedly a fascinating concept and, at first glance, the evidence appears to support it as the mechanism for the evolution of chloroplasts and mitochondria. But it really isn't very good evidence - it is questionable on two counts.
1. It supports the alternative hypothesis equally well (in fact some of the features of mitochondria may be explained better by the alternative hypothesis).
2. It is the wrong sort of evidence because none of these data have been shown to be synapomorphies between prokaryotes and organelles.""

453,You want macroevolution? How about a new organelle? Recently acquired plastids in Paulinella chromatophora,20,True,"Bacterial endosymbionts, bacterial cells that live within larger cells, are not particularly uncommon among unicellular eukaryotes. The protists in the termite gut, for example, harbor endosymbiotic bacteria that make the proteins to break down cellulose. 

 

What is rare, at least we thought, was the transition of these endosymbiotic bacteria into true organelles. 

 

But now we're seeing an example of that very event in a type of amoeboid cell called Paulinella chromatophora. What's the evidence? Transfer of genes from the bacterial endosymbiont to the nuclear genome of the amoeboid. The endosymbiont has lost over half of it's genes, and many have been identified in the host's nuclear genome. But then when those genes are expressed, the proteins end up with the bacteria. Gene loss and protein import are keys step in organellogenesis. 

 

Even cooler is the timeframe. This is going on *right now*, and probably started only about 60 million years ago, as opposed to 1.5 *billion* for your typical chloroplasts. 

 

So this has a lot going on. Organellogenesis, horizontal gene transfer, complex interactions between two species. It's a textbook case of the evolution of a trait that, if creationists were right, cannot possibly evolve. But here it is, happening before our eyes.

Would you say that it is plausible that a tornado over a junkyard could produce a 747 ?
Would you say that it is plausible that mindless random chance can write a book, or produce the hardware and software of a computer ?
The cell is like a factory, that has various computer like hierarchically organized systems of hardware and software, various language based informational systems, a translation system, hudge amounts of precise instructional/specified, complex information stored and extract systems to make all parts needed to produce the factory and replicate itself, the scaffold structure, that permits the build of the indispensable protection wall, form and size of its building, walls with gates that permits cargo in and out, recognition mechanisms that let only the right cargo in, has specific sites and production lines, ""employees"", busy and instructed to produce all kind of necessary products, parts and subparts with the right form and size through the right materials, others which mount the parts together in the right order, on the right place, in the right sequence, at the right time, which has sophisticated check and error detection mechanisms all along the production process, the hability to compare correctly produced parts to faulty ones and discard the faulty ones, and repeat the process to make the correct ones; highways and cargo carriers that have tags which recognize where to drop the cargo where its needed, cleans up waste and has waste bins and sophisticated recycle mechanisms, storage departments, produces its energy and shuttles it to where its needed, and last not least, does reproduce itself.
The salient thing is that the individual parts and compartments have no function by their own. They had to emerge ALL AT ONCE, No stepwise manner is possible, all systems are INTERDEPENDENT and IRREDUCIBLE. And it could not be through evolution, since evolution depends on fully working self replicating cells, in order to function.
How can someone rationally argue that the origin of the most sophisticated factory in the universe would be probable to be based on natural occurence, without involving any guiding intelligence ?

463,"I have a few days off, time for a new thread. HIV Vpu is a clear case of the evolution of novel functionality. Now stop claiming it can't happen. Come at me, creationists.",14,True,"Tetherin is a protein that is a component of the human immune system (and the immune systems of other animals, but we care about the human version). Tetherin is so named because it prevents some viruses from escaping the surface of cells after they've infected and replicated. So viruses that can successfully infect humans have to overcome tetherin.

 

HIV-1 has a small protein called Vpu that antagonizes tetherin and allows HIV to escape from infected cells. SIVcpz (chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus, from which HIV-1 evolved) also has Vpu, and chimps have tetherin, but Vpu is not a tetherin antagonist in chimps. SIV uses a protein called Nef in that role. 

 

Furthermore, you can put the SIVcpz Vpu gene in HIV-1, and it is unable to overcome tetherin when it infects human cells. 

 

Based on phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis, HIV-1 crossed from chimps into humans somewhere around 1930, give or take a decade or so. In order for that to occur, Vpu in the viruses that became HIV-1 had to have acquired the changes required to overcome human tetherin. 

 

So let's be clear about what happened here: A protein in the ancestral virus to HIV-1 had to accumulate a sufficient number of changes to acquire a new function, without losing it's old function, before there would have been selection for that new function. And this all happened within the observable past, since HIV-1 is, at most, about a century old. 

 

This is a textbook case of new information appearing through not only natural processes, but *non-selective* processes. 

 

Creationists, we're going to stop claiming this can't happen, right? Right.

465,Question on Mosquitoes for both those who do and don't believe in evolution.,0,True,"This is something that makes no sense to me from either perspective, so thought it would be interesting to see what the 2 camps make of it.

There are many different types, but I am taking about the mosquitoes people think about, that have the following characteristics:

-The females draw blood only, and do it to aid reproduction.    
-This suggest that there are little alternative uses for this, otherwise males would also do it, as well as non pregnant females.    
-Without another use for evolution to co-opt from, the following things would need to evolve simultaneously. (1) the apparatus to extract blood; (2) the behaviour (which is hard wired) to find suitable hosts to extract blood; (3) The digestive and reproductive systems that can take advantage this blood.    


This (and other cases of behaviour needing to evolve such as spider webs), seems a pretty strong argument in favour of irreducible complexity that cooption can't explain. Any thoughts from evolutionists?


On the other hand I would like to see what those who disagree with evolution thinks of this (I know this may not strictly be the right sub, but I think it provides an interesting challenge against intelligent design and therefore is related). Why would an intelligent designer, design hard wired behaviour that mess up their other creations?

What happens is a body plan is controlled by DNA, and DNA is kind of like the digital code in a computer. It has information, and **information is only the product of a mind.** You **can't evolve information except for very, very small amounts.** So you look at these major transitions, that tells you that you have huge amounts of new information being injected into your genome, but information can only be produced by a mind.

I've broken his talk into 3 parts, and this is part 1.

> 
> One of the problems is the fossil record. When you look at the fossils, what you see is that **anything really novel and new appears suddenly and you don’t see series of ancestors leading back to some more primitive form.** So you don't see series of ancestors going from, let’s say, an amphibian to a fish, or linking the large phyla together, what you see instead is that, for instance, the Cambrian explosion, where about 530 to 50 million years ago, you see the sudden appearance of all the major body plans we know today, so the first time you see something like a clam, or a starfish, or a fish, it **appears very suddenly** in the fossil record, without a series of ancestors going back to an evolutionary tree.
> 
> In fact, what you find is when you hear the term “transitional fossil”, that means something very different from what people think it means. **What you don't have are true transitions.** A true transition is you have an ancestor, a transition, and then a descendant. That's not what a transition is. A transition, like Archaeopteryx, like Lucy, like Therapsids, they’re more like toaster ovens. What you see are species which are typically well within a given group that share features of another group. So it’s like a toaster oven. A toaster oven has features of both a toaster and an oven, but a toaster oven is not halfway between a toaster and an oven. **What you see in the fossil record is that anything new appears suddenly, and then it does not change beyond very small microevolutionary changes.**

> A second issue is when you look at, what does it take to form a body plan? Like, what's the difference between a clam, and a sea urchin, and, let's say, a jelly fish? That basic body plan, whether it's a radial structure, whether it's bilateral, whether it has a nerve cord on the top or the bottom, those large scale architectural differences are formed in development. So you have an egg which starts to form new cells which become an embryo which becomes an adult.

And it did not take as long as I expected to add bonobo, as well as update all the files to the latest assemblies. 

The experiment had interesting results. There are clearly prominent bands we share with bonobos, not even found in chimps or others. A smaller number of banding regions better match a chimp, but all in all it looks to me like the origin of at least our Chromosome 2 is more bonobo than chimp. To judge for yourself here's the data:

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1439-atp-synthase

A critically important macromolecule—arguably “second in importance only to DNA”—is ATP. ATP is an abbreviation for adenosine triphosphate, a complex molecule that contains the nucleoside adenosine and a tail consisting of three phosphates. As far as known, all organisms from the simplest bacteria to humans use ATP as their primary energy currency. In each of the approximately one hundred trillion human cells is about one billion ATP molecules.
Without ATP, life as we understand it could not exist. All the books in the largest library in the world may not be able to contain the information needed to understand and construct the estimated 100,000 complex macromolecule machines used in humans.  Anything less than an entire ATP molecule will not function and a manufacturing plant which is less then complete cannot produce a functioning ATP. Dr. Jerry Bergman
New X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the working of adenosine triphosphate synthase, the basis of energy transport in all living organisms.
ATP captures the chemical energy released by the combustion of nutrients and transfers it to reactions that require energy, e.g. the building up of cell components, muscle contraction, transmission of nerve messages and many other functions. ATP synthase molecules located within mitochondria stick out on the mitochondria, attached to their inner surfaces in mushroom-like clusters. When food is broken down or metabolized for energy, the last stages of the process occur within the mitochondria.


ATP synthase is an irreducibly complex motor—a proton-driven motor divided into rotor and stator portions. Protons can flow freely through the CF0 complex without the CF1 complex, so that if it would have emerged first, a pH gradient could not have been established within the thylakoids. The δ and critical χ protein subunits of the CF1 complex are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the chloroplast in everything from Chlorella to Eugenia in the plant kingdom.  All of the parts must be shipped to the right location, and all must be the right size and shape, down to the very tiniest detail. Using a factory assembly line as an analogy, after all the otherwise useless and meaningless parts have been manufactured in different locations and shipped in to a central location, they are then assembled, and, if all goes as intended, they fit together perfectly to produce something useful. But the whole process has been carefully designed to function in that way. The whole complex must be manufactured and assembled in just one certain way, or nothing works at all. Since nothing works until everything works, there is no series of intermediates that natural selection could have followed gently up the back slope of mount impossible. The little proton-driven motor known as ATP synthase consists of eight different subunits, totalling more than 20 polypeptide* chains, and is an order of magnitude smaller than the bacterial flagellar motor, which is equally impossible for proponents of evolution to explain.  10


ATP synthatse is a irreducible complex molecular motor par excelence. Disconnect one of its components, disturb one of its forms, replace some of your AA position,  and the system loses function altogether. Try to build it slowly, step by step, by mindless unguided processes, where would  the energy come from to build it, if it is the energy provider of life? Remember though that the energy that produces ATP synthase is essential to life, virtually for all forms of life. And unless the proton gradient is in place, ATPsynthase would be useless. 

“Various forms of this ingenious device are found in all forms of life.”[size=11]2[/size]

Thus, your statement, “But some anaerobic bacteria do not contain the enzyme ATP synthase” is apparently incorrect. If any bacterium is discovered without it, I would like to know about it.

In sum, all life depends on ATPase, but not all life depends on it for ATP production. Anaerobic bacteria use it to maintain pH balance instead. So ATPase must have been present in the very first cell. No known natural process could have built it up piece-by-piece, as you have suggested, because without the entire apparatus, there is no living cell and therefore no evolution, even in theory.

Since evolution by natural selection requires reproduction, and since reproduction requires life, which requires ATPase, the enzyme is therefore a prerequisite for evolution. But with evolution out of order until ATPase ‘appears’, evolution is not even in the running as a model to explain the origin of the molecular motor.

Each of the below mentioned parts are ESSENTIAL and IRREDUCIBLE. Take away one , and ATP synthase ceases to function. Neither could any of the sub parts simply be co-opted from anywhere else. That would be the same as to say, in order to make a motor function, and a cylinder is missing, go search and find any cylinder nearby , co-opt it, and solved is the problem. The thing is that cylinders come in all size, specification, materials etc. And there is no goal oriented search of parts that fit through evolution Evolution has no forsight. Furthermore, there must be the information how and when and where to mount the parts, at the exact place, in the right sequence.  Thats a far fetch for a mindless  tinkerer to be able to achieve. 

1.The nucleotide binding stator subunits (“cylinders”) :  The electrostatic interaction of these rotor and stator charges is essential for torque generation
2.The central stalk (“crankshaft”) : The torsional elasticity of the central stalk and the bending and stretching elasticity of the peripheral stalk create an elastic coupling between Fo and F1. Is is essential.
3, The A/V rotor subunit (“adapter”) ; It is not used in all ATP synthase motors, and can therefore be reduced.
4. The Rotor ring (“turbine”) ;  A ring of 8–15 identical c-subunits is essential for ion-translocation by the rotary electromotor of the ubiquitous FOF1-
ATPase.
5.The Jon channel forming subunit ; Subunit a harbors the ion channel that provides access to the binding site on the c11 ring in the middle of the membrane from the periplasmic surface . The channel is essential for the operation of the enzyme, because mutants in which the channel is blocked are completely inactive in both the ATP synthesis and/or coupled ATP hydrolysis mode
6. The peripheral stalk (“pushrod”) ; The peripheral stalk of F-ATPases is an essential component of these enzymes. It extends from the membrane distal point of the F1 catalytic domain along the surface of the F1 domain with subunit a in the membrane domain.
7 - 11 do not exist in all atp synthase motors, and can therefore be reduced. 

There are at least 5 subunit parts essential to mantain the basice function of the ATP synthase motor.

492,A comparison of the information spaces of DNA and English words,0,True,"I'm going to post the tl;dr here first, so that if you wish to discuss my thesis without examining the details, you can do so:

As you may know, I'm a computer designer by training and occupation, so my penchant is to examine the creation/evolution issue from the perspective of the implications of the information content of DNA.

DNA is in essence an [information space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_space). It is truly a huge information space. The [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome) comprises 3 billion [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair), each of which contains two [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit), for a total of 6 billion bits (6 gigabits) of information. In information space terms, it is a space of 6 billion [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension). It can contain the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) of any living creature with a genome no larger than ours--in fact it can contain *any possible creature's* genome of that size. Nevertheless, all of those possibilities occupy only a minuscule fraction of the total information space, and almost all of the [loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics\)) in that space represent nonviable genomes. The problem for evolution proponents, who claim that all the diversity that we see in the realm of life ""evolved"" from a single original cell by a process of random mutations sorted by natural selection, is the vastness of the information space and the tininess of the amount of that space occupied by genomes of viable organisms. As is typical for real information space implementations, the loci occupied by viable genomes appear to form innumerable clusters that are separated from one another by vast distances. This does not allow for traversal of the information space via random mutations from cluster to cluster. Rather, to permit evolution by random mutations and selection, it is necessary for all genomes that have ever existed to form continuous strings of near-contiguous loci, so that mutations can jump from locus to locus. Since this is universally not the case for other information spaces and does not appear to be the case for the DNA information space, it is incumbent upon the proponents of evolution to demonstrate that it is possible to traverse the information space from the genome of the very first protocell to the genomes of *every other life form* that now or ever existed, a truly Sampsonian task.

By default and until demonstrated otherwise, we should assume that the DNA information space is configured in a clustered fashion similar to other information spaces, and thus common-descent evolution is not a reasonable possibility.

---

Now I would like to present the results of an analysis I have been conducting on information spaces containing English words. 

[This image](http://imgur.com/a/QPa73) displays the results of a compilation of 172,880 words in a comprehensive list of English words. It simply lists the number of words in the list that are of each specific length. 

* Column **A** specifies the word lengths
* Column **B** reports the number of words of that length in column A
* Column **C** is a running total of the words that are shorter than or equal in length to the word length in column A
* Column **D** is the size of the information space of all words shorter than or equal to the word length in column A (specifically, it is 26^(A))
* Column **E** is the fraction C/D, which denotes the fraction of the information space occupied by actual words
* Column **F** is the first word of the length in column A encountered alphabetically
* Column **G** is the last word of the length in column A encountered alphabetically

Two things to notice:

* The first thing to notice is that the address space grows very quickly (exponentially, in fact) as the number of permitted letters in the word increases. For a word length of one, the address space permits a possible 26 words, specifically ""A"" through ""Z"". For two-letter words, the address space is 26^(2) = 676 words (column **B**), or, if we include the 26 one-letter words, the space accommodates 676 + 26 = 702 words (column **C**). But the address space for the largest word in the word list, having 28 characters, is 26^(28) = 4,161,536,836,220,038,342,098,551,818,958,563,878,766 words.
* The second thing to notice is that the number of actual words that occupy this address space, 172,880, may seem large when considered alone, but when considered in relation to the vast size of the address space, it is tiny beyond comprehension. For single-letter words, there are only two words, ""A"" and ""I"", situated in an address space that can accommodate 26 words, so 7.7% of the space is utilized. For two-letter words, 99 slots are taken in a space of 676 slots, for an occupancy rate of 14.9%. After this, the occupancy rate drops precipitously, until the occupancy rate for a 28-letter address space is an incomprehensible 4 * 10^(-35).

It is normal, both in word spaces and the DNA space, for there to exist clusters of functional loci. In the English word space, these clusters are the result of related words that have a common base—for example, words based on the Latin ""spectō"" (watch): spectator, spectators, spectate, spectated, spectates, spectacle, spectacles, bespectacled, respect, inspect, inspects, inspected, inspector, inspectors, aspect, aspects, expect, expects, expected, etc. Likewise, the DNA space will have clusters of related genes serving related functions in diverse life forms—for example, since every living organism requires the ribosome, there will be closely related genes for all the ribosome proteins and RNA strings, all clustered closely together in the DNA information space. These will be similar but not identical across the diverse forms of life. In addition, when mutations throughout a life form's history produce variants that are still viable, these also will be present in the ""ribosome cluster"".

But it is also normal, both in word spaces and in the DNA space, for there to be clusters that are inaccessible from other clusters by random mutations, because the clusters are separated by vast distances of nonsense loci that are not navigable by random mutations that can be realistically expected to occur. In the English word space, I found that there were clusters of words that could not be accessed by less than six simultaneous fortuitous mutations—one-third to one-half the words' lengths! And the situation could be expected to be worse in the extreme for the DNA space. The English word space is 28 characters, which, at (log_base_2(28) = 4.8 bits) per letter * 28 letters is a mere 135 bits, the human DNA space is a whopping 6 *billion* bits (okay, if you want to say that only 1% of human DNA is functional, then that number shrinks to a tiny 60 million bits). It would be reasonable to expect that the clusters of functional DNA would be isolated from one another by distances across trackless nonsense loci that lack proper superlatives to describe. Now, this may not be the case; perhaps DNA is somehow different from all other address spaces we know of. But it is reasonable to begin with the assumption that the DNA space is not an exception until demonstrated otherwise. Please demonstrate otherwise, or else accept that this is a fatal flaw in the notion of common-descent evolution.

493,"We seem so soul-less and just ""unmagical"".",2,True,"This is not really a hard argument I guess but when I first learned more and more about evolution things seemed to make so much sense. I'm more speaking about things that seem random in creation but when put in light of evolution it's just, ""well that makes sense"".

What am I talking about?

The simplest things. Like: Why do we get nervous(before exams, holding a presentation and the like)? It is super random if you think about it from a creationist perspective. It has no use at all and just makes you feel bad. Well it is part of the ""fight or flight"" response wich is totally useless for an exam as you are not runing around. We are victim of a basically automated process. Just like animals.

Even drinking alcohol is weird for me. We lose control of our action in a way wich is totally understandable if you understand the biochemistry behind it but seems weird for a being that has a soul. Our character can change so simply by a drink? If we take it to the extreme and look how heavy drugs can fuck up some people for their entire live because they suffer paranoia and totally change their character. Wouldn't a soul be resistent to this?

Or people with ASPD. Those who are not born with it most of the time experienced a traumatizing childhood. Something happens in their development and now they become these weird people. I bet if you wanted, you could ""grow"" ASPD people on purpose wich seems to me like control over a human character that shouldn't happen with a soul that is made by god.

Even just instincts like wanting to have sex or eat. We are so animal like. Seriously I bet not even 50% of all christian males abstain from masturbation. Why the fuck did god make it so hard to just not want to jerk off? We have so little control.

497,When can a mutation or adaptive change become part of a genetic heritage?,3,True,"I have always been a little confused on this, so I hope someone can help. In sexual reproduction, for complex species (let's narrow it down to mammals), there would seem to be a small window for genetic change (not variation, like available coloration or size) to be passed on to offspring. Not having college level instruction in reproductive biology, I presume the ovaries and tesicles are the only organs contributing half the genome into gametes. 

So, how do the genetic changes become incorporated into the reproductive organs? I can only imagine that a beneficial change would have to occur in the gametes or rather quickly in the embryonic stage. If a change occurs in a developed body, I can't envision how it would become part of the reproductive organ's supply of (gamete creating) DNA. 

I may have missed the memo, but is that how it is supposed to occur? Totally in vitro? That would seem to relegate any speciation changes to mutation exclusively. Adaptation would still play a role in changing environments, based on available variations (like humans and dogs have many variants) but that would relagate permant/species change be exclusively by in vitro mutation.

Headlines such as “humans and chimps are 99% genetically similar”, “Almost Human: New Human Ancestor found”, “Common Ancestry confirmed by new experiment”, mislead the public into thinking Darwinian evolution is based on indisputable evidence, backed by a consensus amongst biologists. If anything, they are just filling in the details and fine tuning the Darwinian mechanism.

People claim that evolution is unreliable because science is never certain and thus they view evolution as not being totally valid as said here:

No theory is 100% complete. We just have what philosophers call ""the inference to the best explanation"". Pick any basic book on the philosophy of science. And I repeat, statistical confirmation just proves my - and the majority of scientists and the philosophers of science - point, which is: it can change, it's not 100%, but it would be ridiculous to deny the best that we currently have. Also, and with respect, if you can find a single academic that claims Darwinism is 100% complete, I'll eat my ""hat"" 
However, the point is that Darwinian evolution is not certain. The podcast briefly introduces some aspects of the philosophy of science. If understood, will lead to the conclusion that scientific conclusions can change, there can always be a future observation that can alter or deny previous conclusions.

499,This post is only for those willing to (at least temporarily) suspend the Methodological Naturalism presupposition,0,True,"# This post is only for those willing to (at least temporarily) suspend the baseless, dogmatic Methodological Naturalism presupposition

This article is a first response to /u/VestigialPseudogene's gracious offer to consider suspending the MN presupposition, as made in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/58jixn/my_view_on_stereotypes_and_this_sub/d90wuwa/).

As I pointed out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4n8wv3/methodological_naturalism_is_an_unfounded/?ref=search_posts) article, I am not proposing that things that science can't currently explain be attributed to supernatural causes; there must be good reason to conclude supernatural causation over the natural. And, also stressed in that article, any attribution to supernatural cause should be considered tentative, pending further discoveries, as is always the case in science. This second point removes any concern that such conclusions become dogmatic and irreversible.

As I laid out in [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/52x7bd/how_does_the_addition_of_even_the_possibility_of/?ref=search_posts), I think that there is a compelling philosophical reason to leave open the possibility of extra- or super-natural causation: every time that we attempt to construct a *closed* system, we encounter inconsistencies caused by [self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference). This has occurred multiple times in mathematics:

* When logical statements reference themselves, the result can be nonsense. The statement ""This statement is false"" is false if it is true, and true if it is false. It is therefore nonsense. Similarly, but not so obviously, the statement ""This statement is true"" is nonsense, because it can be either true or false. The problem: self-reference (however, not all self-referencing statements are nonsense, as can be seen in Godel's theorems).

* In set theory, it is necessary to carefully define when and how sets can contain themselves as members. A first attempt at this, called ""[naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intuitive_set_theory)"", defines a set as ""any collection of objects or thinkable ideas"". Of course the set itself is a thinkable idea, so this is a case of self-reference, and leads to [Russel's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).

* Kurt Gödel's [incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) *proved* that any formal [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system) system containing [basic arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic), such as ours, is either inconsistent or incomplete. We choose to consider it consistent, so it is therefore incomplete, i.e., there exist true assertions that can never be proven, and thus must be accepted on some other basis. Ironically, these assertions have been called ""supernatural"" theorems.

---

I propose that we consider supernatural causation in at least three circumstances:

* **Necessarily Extra-Natural Causation**. There is at least one event that *cannot* have a natural cause: the beginning of nature (the universe and time-space itself). At one time, it was generally held in the secular science community that time was eternal, and there was considerable resistance to acceptance of the notion that time had a beginning—it sounded too much like a capitulation to the position that Christians have adamantly maintained on the basis of the first sentence of the Bible. But the evidence is overwhelming that the universe indeed had a beginning. Even those unwilling to accept a God-based interpretation are nevertheless compelled to admit to the extra-natural many-worlds interpretation.

* **Prediction**. If a prediction is sufficiently unlikely and yet is fulfilled, it violates our laws of probability. Of course, there are some caveats that must be considered. When a meteorologist makes a weather prediction that is fulfilled, that prediction can be very unlikely from our perspective (insufficient data or computing power), but not from the meteorologist's. Also, ""self-fulfillment"" must be ruled out. Now, most Biblical predictions, or ""prophesies"", are unconvincing to the skeptic for a host of reasons: vagueness, shrouded in uncertain history, self-fulfillment, etc.; however, I claim that many objections fall apart under close examination. But I think that there is an outstanding example that is extremely difficult to refute: the Jewish return to their homeland, over two millennia after the prediction. I laid out the basics of this prophesy [here](), but there is much more to be said, and I suggest we leave that for another time.

* **Information-Theory-Based**. Like the prediction-based argument, this class of arguments is generally based on probability, and includes ID theory, irreducible complexity, and arguments I have posted that are based on the vastness of DNA's [information space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_space) and the sparseness of its population, making mutation/selection-based evolution effectively impossible.

There were creationist youtube channels with thousands of subscribers (when thousands of subscribers was a lot). If you wanted to debate one you could go straight to forums, religious movies on IMDB, youtube, and you would have no trouble finding one.

But now, they seem to have completely disappeared. The creation/evolution forums can go months between new posts. Creationist youtube videos still get posted, but most of them have views in the double digits. There seems to be only one creationist who regularly posts here.

For the most part, the ones are still active are, for lack of a better word, batshit insane. For example, a couple of youtube videos feature conversations between about 10 creationists, all of them sockpuppets of the same person!

Is it something to do with a lack of a creationist rallying cry? There used to be popular events around the creationist movement. Things like the Dover trial, Kent Hovind's arrest, the movie Expelled, heavily publicised debates ect.

414,"Fine Tuning, A Major Problem for Young Earth Creationist",7,True,"Fine Tuning, A Major Problem for Young Earth Creationist

The concept of 'Fine Tuning' is that the constants that describe the physical universe are so exact that if their values were to vary even by the smallest amount then the universe could not exist. Therefore there has to be an intelligence behind the generation of these constants as they could not happen naturally.  This means that, for example,  'C' which is a physical constant that is used in various explanations that describe the observable universe is not just some random value but is was specifically set by an intelligence as a controlling factor of our universe.  It is part of the basic fabric of our universe and as such is set to a precise value that cannot change for if it did the universe would no longer be able to exist let alone be created.

So how is this 'Fine Tuning' a problem for Young Earth Creationist (YEC). Well for starters YEC have a speed of light problem.  You see there are several readily observable astronomical sights that demonstrate that both the Universe and the Earth are both many orders of magnitude older than the YEC accept as calculated using the Bible.

Now when YEC are presented with these astronomical findings their answer is always along the lines of the the speed of light has changed over time.  However, the speed of light is directly related one to one with the physical constant 'C'.  A physical constant that, according to the creationist Fine Tuning argument, is a set value in order to permit the universe to exist. If the speed of light changes, then the physical constant 'C' must change and if the physical constant 'C' changes then according to Fine Tuning the universe will cease to exist.

415,"Grading creationism, why ""On Error Catastrophe (reprise) With Documentation"" fails. Part 1.",4,True,"FThe reason creationism fails, other than a total lack of evidence, is because there are only two ways to argue for it: by being misinformed, or to misinform others.

 

Seeing as how /u/No-Karma-II likes to cite papers now, he can't be misinformed, and so he must be one who misinforms. This is made perfectly clear by /u/No-Karma-II's citations. Let us examine the first one.

 

He said:

 

> Wikipedia defines [error catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_catastrophe) in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism goes extinct:
> ""Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [...] as a result of excessive mutations.""

 

But that isn't exactly accurate. I will place brackets around the parts No-Karma-II left out:

 

Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [**(often in the context of microorganisms such as viruses)**] as a result of excessive mutations. [**Error catastrophe is something predicted in mathematical models and has also been observed empirically.**]

 

Now, why would he leave that part out? Could it be because he already knew that comparing asexually reproducing bacteria and virus's method of propagation to our own is highly flawed? Or could it be, because it was mentioned as being **OBSERVED EMPIRICALLY,** that quoting it in full completely destroys his claim that “ Wikipedia defines error catastrophe in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism goes extinct?”

 

Now this is the “definition” No-Karma-II is trying to push on us:
> ""Error catastrophe is the genetic condition in which deleterious mutations are accumulating over successive generations at a rate that is faster than selection can eliminate them.""

 

Which is such a vague definition that it defines every single species that exists, because it purposefully(and dishonestly) ignores *equilibrium*.

 

“This theorem may be expressed by saying that the frequency of the disorder among the individuals of the population (i.e. the proportion of individuals that manifest the disorder) reaches an equilibrium value (f) when it is equal to the frequency (n) with which new cases manifesting it are arising by mutation in each generation, multiplied by the persistence (p), that is, the average number of generations during which a mutant gene of the given type manifests itself in the population before becoming eliminated by selection.”

 

My quote comes from the same paper as No-Karma-II next quote:
> “ it is evident that the natural rate of mutation of man is so high, and his natural rate of reproduction so low, that not a great deal of margin is left for selection [...] if u [the number of mutations per individual per generation] has the minimal value of 0.1 [...] an average reproductive rate of 2.4 children per individual would be necessary [...] without taking any account whatever of all the deaths and failures to reproduce for non-genetic causes”

 

This is the least inaccurate quote, the only edits are extra numbers and ends of beginnings of sentences. Now No-Karma-II says “ I could cite many more quotes from the same paper that make it clear that a value for u of 0.5 or more would ensure the extinction of the human race” but that isn't really accurate. If you actually read this 66 long page paper, which I'm sure No-Karma-II didn't, you would find that the authors was talking about how genetics plays a role in more diseases than what doctors of the time(the 1950's) where willing to accept. Muller also noted that the build up of mutations in the population will take a while to matter, “probably not half attained a thousand years from now even if conditions remained constant in the interim,” and even then we are in no danger of extinction:

 

“But even if we were quite convinced that humanity would not be content to continue indefinitely along the road to an actual genetic denouement, we should not for that reason feel justified in regarding the matter of mutational load as one of little consequence. Just because a practice will not result in the wiping out of the human race is no reason why we should go to the other extreme, of considering it innocuous or negligible, as some would have us do in the case of radiation as soon as they find that an atomic bomb will not result in a population of monsters.”

 

Basically if we start selectively breeding humans now, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble in the future if we don't people will die at the same rate as we did before agriculture and modern medicine. “At the same time, the amount of genetically caused suffering short of extinction will also have become comparable with what it had been originally”

 

While Muller was a brilliant man, even winning a Nobel Prize for his research on the effects of x-rays on Drosophila, his paper “Our Load of Mutations” is from 1950, 66 years old. Muller died in 1967, and the human genome wasn't fully sequenced until 2003. Muller also mentioned in this paper:

 

“Unless means could be found of lessening the natural mutation rate (a feat that would require the extended maintenance of the germ cells in vitro as a regular procedure)” which is now possible. As of 2001 we have created [geneticallymodified humans](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-43767/Worlds-GM-babies-born.html) and thanks to tools like [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) that will be even easier to do in the future. However, a paper I found might mean that isn't necessary for our survival.

 

“A Resolution of the Mutation Load Paradox in Humans” Published in 2012 by by the Genetics Society of America notes that:

 

“The evolutionary consequences of deleterious mutations were first studied by J. B. S. Haldane, who showed that the reduction in mean fitness in a diploid organism caused by recurrent semidominant deleterious mutation at a single locus is equal to twice the mutation rate (Haldane 1937). This led H. J. Muller to suggest that each new deleterious mutation ultimately leads to one genetic death, irrespective of the mutation’s fitness effect (Muller 1950).” 

 

However, this paper also says: 

 

“Our analytical results and simulations suggest a resolution of the mutation load paradox by showing that a very high number of deleterious mutations can be eliminated from the population each generation and that the population can still be viable. Our results also demonstrate that one mutation does not necessarily result in one genetic death.”

 

If, unlike Muller, you take into consideration the extent to which every individual mutation is deleterious, you can show that individual fitness plays a large role in how many mutations can be passed along without causing an error catastrophe, and:

 

“We have shown that the proportion of individuals that fail to have descendants in the next generation under a relative fitness model is substantially lower than that predicted under an absolute viability fitness model and that species could potentially survive a mutation rate of 10’s if not 100’s of deleterious mutations per genome per generation if selection was largely mediated through competition.”

 

Meaning that the “Thus if U^t has the minimal value of  0.1(n^t = 0.18)” quote used by /u/No-Karma-II is outdated and doesn't matter.

 

No-Karma-II says this about the next citation, “The Cost of Natural Selection”

 

> “As early as 1957, J.B.S. Haldane pointed out in his paper3 that selection has a reproductive cost that must be paid. The cost is paid in the form of reproductive excess that dies in order to meet certain requirements. Several requirements are identified: (1) mutation; (2) segregation; (3) balancing; (4) substitution; and of course (5) random. Mutation deaths are the 3 that concern us here. Any modification in the genome by mutation, whether it be beneficial or deleterious, exacts a cost. The beneficial mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do not* inherit the mutation in order to achieve ""fixation"" of the mutation, and conversely, deleterious mutations require the deaths of the offspring that do inherit the mutation. The deaths need not be in the first generation, and usually are not, but the deaths must eventually occur.”

 

Karma says more but the entire mention of the paper in his post is pointless, actually the summary of the paper contradicts his claim that mutations(especially the VSDMs on which natural selection can't select against because their effect is so weak) would build up and cause an error catastrophe, because the more mutations there are, the longer it would take for any one of them spread far enough to influence the survival rate of the population as a whole. 

 

“Unless selection is very intense, the number of deaths needed to secure the substitution, by natural selection, of one gene for another at a locus, is independent of the intensity of selection. It is often about 30 times the number of organisms in a generation. It is suggested that, in horotelic evolution, the mean time taken for each gene substitution is about 300 generation. This accords with the observed slowness of evolution.”

 

I am unable to get a hold of a copy from which is next citation originates.

 

> One surprising thing I learned in researching this article is the reason why non-coding DNA was immediately termed ""junk"": it was necessary for it to be useless because if it was, then the effects of deleterious mutations would be more manageable. By declaring 99% of the genome that is non-coding to be ""junk"", the target size for deleterious mutations was reduced 100-fold:

> ""we believe the conclusion is inevitable that in the human genome, nucleotide substitution has an appreciable effect on fitness in only a small fraction of DNA sites, possibly less than 1% of the total.""

 

But, this claim is dubious at best, because his citation “Theoretical Aspects of Population Genetics,” is a 232 page book that costs between ~$10 and $70. I seriously doubt No-Karma-II researched this personally, which would make his claim plagiarism, based on the size of this source and the fact that only small snippets can be found for free. The quote he uses, which isn't available for viewing, doesn't even start at the beginning of a sentence. Due to the inability to verify the context of this quote, it must be thrown out.

 

His next two citations come from the same paper, “THE RELATION OF RECOMBINATION TO MUTATIONAL ADVANCE” also by Muller:

 

> ""an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that [...] lines become more heavily loaded with mutation.""

and

> ""There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.), but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis [...] although deserving of it.""

 

Now there are a few problems with these quotes. First problem is the first quote he lists is from page 7, and the second quote is from page 6. There is also the mater of the first quote being taken from the middle of a sentence, and having missing section in the middle of the quote. Let's take a look at his quotes in context, his quote will be italicized and the unquoted parts will be bold to contrast: 

**Our table has shown that, as the degree of advantage conferred by mutant genes diminishes, the rate of accumulation of the given genes is retarded in asexual species but not (over the long term) in sexual ones, so that it is these small mutations which give the greatest differential between the rates of sexual and asexual species.** *There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.) but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis* [**or other investigation,**] *although deserving of it.* **At any rate, below this level accumulation would falter and cease, no matter what the type of reproduction.**

 

The next quote, in context, in the same format:

 

**Nevertheless, the culling out is done in a less flexible manner in the asexual than in the sexual population, and is correspondingly more subject to maladjustments. If we disregard advantageous mutations, including those of reverse and suppressor types, and concentrate our attention on the effects of selection, we find that** *an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that* [**it can never get to contain, in any of its lines, a load of mutations smaller than that already existing in its at present least-loaded lines. However, the latter**] *lines* [**can (in some of their branches, at any rate)**] *become more heavily loaded* ~~by~~ with *mutation.* **It would be of interest to attempt calculations and experiments on the possible long-term effect of this ratchet mechanism on the populational load. In a recombining population, on the other hand, the application of more rigorous selection can result, in the course of generations, in an actual lessening of the mutational load. This would apply not only to individuals which represent population averages in respect to load but even to those least heavily encumbered. In fact, the load of the population could, theoretically, be caused to approach zero, although the operation would not be a practicable one.**

 

This quote is literally the end of the paper, and No-Karma-II absolutely misconstrues everything it says, what little of it he quoted. He leaves out some very important information, like that different lines can have different mutational loads. More importantly he leaves out the fact that in species that use recombination, such as humans(and all other sexually reproducing species) that in time recombination can actually **lessen** the mutational load! He has literally lied about how Muller's wrench works. As I have said, there are only two kinds of creationists, those who are misinformed, and those who do the misinforming. Now, so far we have only covered 5 of his 14 citations. Unfortunately this means I will have to make a few more of these posts, but so far it should be obvious that when it comes to science, creationism fails every time.

Regarding the stereotypes of creationists:

* Tightly correlated and tightly knit with religious fundamentalism/literalism

* Still using the same arguments since several decades. *(I have not been able to find a new sounding argument, just some arguments which are very clear variations of old arguments)*

* Not being experts in the field of biology *(I guess it should be possible to find them though, it's just very clear that we are looking at an awkward minority)*




 

All in all, the last couple of months seem to have been incredibly productive, congratulations. I have gone trough the submissions and tried to find creationists with novel/innovative arguments but so far it has been devastating:

* Accusations that the whole understanding of biology is wrong because of some kind of naturalism thing. (still don't get it)

* C^14 dating for fossils (This one is definitely decades old even though it should have died out decades ago)

* Baseless accusation of a whole scientific field for intentional/unintentional fraud, usually from an amateur

* People claiming all of DNA has function, again never backed up by much, ENCODE being the only thing coming near to it

* Irreducible complexity again and again, with biologists having the standard answer that we already have several examples that looked irreducible and then weren't anymore.

* Several cases of argument from ignorance: This and that looks to complex, this and that is too beautiful. Not really that convincing and also as old as the cold war, probably more.

* In the same vein, the ID argument, also pretty old and not new: This and that look to complex, therefore, without a shred of evidence, we can *infer* a designer.

* ToE is not falsifiable. Probably so old that people could copy paste answers for this.

That was just last week, we go deeper into the months:

* Error catastrophe. Sounds like a new argument at first, however it's the old ""populations are slowly degrading because of mutations"" argument.

* Several dozens of threads about the origin of life. Basically poking holes into something that is a hypothesis anyway. Again pretty popular and Hitler probably heard of that argument too.

* More about the naturalism thing. Sounds more like complaining than actually productively trying to bring forth an argument

* DNA found in dino fossils

 

In my humble observation, I realized that most topics seem to clearly evade the central topics of biology. Could you guys (the biologists etc.) step it up and bring more of them?

For example, I have no idea why you guys are talking so much about naturalism, abiogenesis, ID, dating methods and complexity. This is absolutely *not* central to the ToE.

Tl;Dr: Talk more about phylogenetics and the fossil record. Take those examples where it's pretty much undeniable that evolution **and** common descent absolutely happened.

422,Falsifiability not a requirement of science,0,True,"Karl Popper stated that what separates science from non-science is ""falsifiability"", or ability to empirically show that a theory is false. This might sound simple and reasonable, but in reality, it is very difficult to falsify and know when a theory has been falsified. Historically, theories have not been falsified, only replaced by better theories that have more explanatory and predictive power.

Falsifiability fell out of favor in philosophy of science some time ago. Recently, [many scientists](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/02/falsifiability/) are beginning to [question](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/) the [meaning](http://www.whytrustatheory2015.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of falsifiability. 

Falsifiability is not how science is done in practice. Scientists do not look at their theories in terms of falsifiability. Rather, they try to find evidence to support it. For what they cannot explain, they say they don't know. Practically all non-trivial scientific theories today about the world are unfalsifiable.

The problem is the concept of ""naive falsification"": You don't know if the theory has actually been falsified or the observation is valid and the theory can explain it but you are just ignorant of that fact. 

For example, some say that mammal fossils in the precambrian era would falsify evolution. If they actually found fossils there, would they just throw Darwinism into the dumpster? Ok, and then what? What replaces it? No, in reality and in practice, it would just push back the timeline of divergence. Or it could also mean there was another divergent mammalian branch. Or it could mean the measurement was wrong, a hoax, or alien or time traveling humans. 

Would a failed prediction (there have been many) of Darwinism immediately falsify the theory? No. Why? Because if the theory can explain and predict many observations, then it is scientifically valid. Scientific theories are known for their evidence, explanatory power, and many successful predictions (despite a few failures). 

Scientific theories are not falsified, they are replaced when better theories come.

Kepler's theory of gravity fell out in favor of Newtonian gravity, which then fell out in favor of Einstein's since it was able to predict and explain more. Geocentricism fell out in favor of Heliocentricism since it required less ""epicycles"" and was more simple and elegant. Scientists did not view these theories in terms of ""falsifiability"" but in terms of explanatory power and predictive power. 

Therefore, when certain scientists say Intelligent Design is ""unfalsifiable"", they are being unrealistic and trying to find excuses. Many Darwinist scientists today consider ID to be science (Though a few haven't come out of the closet). The main reason why ID isn't qualified as science is because it has a religious basis. But that isn't anymore invalid than having a materialistic/naturalistic world view, as many Darwinists do. 

**TL; DR:** Scientific theories are not falsified, they are replaced when better theories come.

423,Common ancestor vs Common design,0,True,"The scientific method is not neutral by itself since it is just a process. Scientists make use of the scientific method to the best of their ability. Scientific evidence is does not speak for itself and has to be interpreted. Scientists, like other humans, are not free of their biases and convictions, and so their interpretations may vary from scientist to scientist.

All of the evidence (except the fossil record) used to support common ancestry can be used to support common design. 

First I will start with a claim: Humans have lived since the beginning of the Earth (4 billion years ago) and remained virtually unchanged. They just haven't found fossils for early humans yet. 

Explanations: 

- Genetic similarities between species: The designer simply mutated the genetic information to create all species of life all at once. 

- Phylogeny: The relationships between species can be explained through common designer. 

- Molecular clock: It is based on inference of rates of change and then backtracking to match the supposed evolutionary story. Uses a lot of fiddling of computations.

424,The case for Intelligent Design,0,True,"Intelligent Design is a scientific theory that states that certain features of the universe, such as life and genetics, is best explained through intelligence and knowledge instead of an unintelligent and blind mechanism such as random mutations. 

ID states that objects that have complexity, order, information, function, purpose, and machine-like parts can best be explained by design by an intelligent being that has knowledge.

What do humans design? Machines, vehicles, computer programs, robots, etc. All of which display complexity, order, information, function, purpose, and have machine-like parts. 

If we find these same characteristics somewhere in nature, then we can infer that it was designed by an intelligent designer, because knowledge and intelligence is required to create an object that displays these characteristics. Without it, there is only chaos and disorder. 

We do, in fact, find many biological parts inside of cells that meet all these characteristics and resemble inventions humans create. From this, we can infer that these parts were designed. 

A self-replicating robot humans build can potentially turn into a more complex robot down the road. But the original program for replication was designed by an intelligent agent. Likewise, genetic information has its source in knowledge. 

ID can be falsified if it can be shown that intelligence and knowledge is not required to create complexity, order, information, function, purpose, and machine-like parts. ",1476807647,45,2016-10-18 12:20:47

I would have been forced to concede that alleles are capable of being produced via mutations and natural selection, which is fundamental for the theory of evolution. Suppose we did descend from 2 ancestral humans, Adam and Eve. In theory, the most alleles there could be for any gene would be 4. In the best case scenario, Adam would have alleles A1 and A2, and Eve would have alleles A3 and A4 for any specific gene. This would provide the most variation possible for any one gene. Alas, there are genes with far more than just 4 alleles. In fact, there are genes with more than 1000 alleles (http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/stats.html).  Where did these come from? Did Adam and Eve have 500 duplicates of each chromosome? There are other problems associated with this but I won't go into detail yet. I earnestly wait for a reply.",1476677769,45,2016-10-17 00:16:09
428,Darwinism is not falsifiable,0,True,"A believed hallmark of science is falsification. However, falsification only exists on paper and in the philosophy of science. In practice, it is never done, especially for Darwinism, and for many reasons. 

Darwinism is a ""historic"" science, meaning it is concerned primarily with explaining the origin of all species and lifeforms found today and yesterday. Therefore, it uses forensic methodologies to construct a narrative that explains the past. It also means it's much more difficult to falsify evolution than other sciences such as physics and chemistry, since you can't experimentally demonstrate history. 

Darwinism is also very heavily established in the scientific establishment, that many will still cling onto the theory. 

**Falsification is an opinion**

There is no consensus on what evidence is considered to falsify evolution. Who is to define it and how? Some, such as Richard Dawkins, say [precambrian rabbits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian_rabbit) because it would contradict common descent. Others [disagree](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falsifiability_of_evolution#Precambrian_rabbit) and say it wouldn't, for several reasons: one rabbit isn't enough but several might, it only proves time travel or alien rabbits, the fossils may be a hoax, error in measurement, or just ignored, like what happened with [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco) archaeological finding. 

**Falsification may not be known or premature judgement**

Suppose you do make an observation that could falsify a theory. How do you know it's not an error in measurement? Normally you would run several experiments, but this is very difficult in the field of Darwinism for the reasons mentioned and those that will be mentioned. 

More importantly, how do you know it's not due to ignorance that you are unable to explain the observation? For example, if you found precambrian rabbits, maybe it's due to a misunderstanding of the real process of evolution as some have suggested. 

**Falsification standards are made ad hoc and impossible to falsify**

According to [this](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falsifiability_of_evolution#What_would_falsify_evolution.3F) website, evolution will basically be falsified if it can be shown that genes don't exist, mutations aren't real, and genes aren't passed down. 

However, these standards were created *after* it was shown that all these things are true and after genetics was discovered. 

Charles Darwin stated in his work the idea of irreducible complexity regarding the eye. Darwinism published his work before genetics was discovered, and so his best example of a complex structure was the eye. We now know of many molecular machines, such as the bacterial flagellum, that seriously casts the mechanism of Darwinism, namely random, unguided mutation, into doubt. 

Irreducible complexity is indeed a valid falsification, but notice how the ""rational"" wiki article doesn't mention it in their list.

There is also the possibility of falsification standards being impossible to test, that it is *de facto* unfalsifiable. 

**Too much evidence to be falsified**

There are those who say that evolution has too much evidence that nothing can falsify it. This is contradictory to the meaning of the scientific method and falsification: that scientific conclusions can never be proven, only falsified. This also amounts to nothing more than confirmation bias, since only positive evidence was collected and assessed and everything else was ignored. 

The ""rational"" wiki articles makes that statement.

**Denial, frustration, double standards, emotional attachment, confirmation bias**

Scientists are humans, and despite what they say about being very objective, are actually very much personally and emotionally attached to their theories. It becomes part of their identity. I am a scientist myself (computer scientist), and know many individuals who have said evolution is ""a beautiful theory"", etc. These people's minds can never be changed.

For example, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has officially declared, ""Intelligent design is not a scientific concept because it cannot be empirically tested"" (Science, Evolution, and Creationism (National Academy Press, 2008), p. 42).

However, on page 40 they stated the claims of intelligent design creationists are disproven by the findings of modern biology"" (p. 40). So according to the NAS, ID ""cannot be empirically tested,"" but its claims have been ""disproven by the findings of modern biology."" Surely both statements cannot be true. 

This shows that the scientific establishment cannot properly, and without bias, assess competing scientific theories. 

The ID theory is in fact, scientific, and falsifiable. If it can be shown that complex structures can very likely and consistently be produced through unguided, and random mutations, then there is no need for intelligent foresight. 

**TL; DR / Conclusion**

Darwinism is theoretically falsfiable on paper, but in practice this is not the case. Ad hoc explanations will be given to explain away anomalies or inconsistencies. Darwinism has been elevated to an unquestionable dogma in the scientific establishment.",1476642596,28,2016-10-16 14:29:56

430,A Problem With the Many-Worlds Idea,0,True,"When two motorists arrive to an all-way stop intersection at 90° to each other at exactly the same time, who gets the right-of-way? I'm sure you all know the answer: in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road, the motorist on the right gets the right-of-way. But you may not be aware that this rule does not solve the problem of right-of-way. In fact, the problem has no closed solution! Regardless of how the rule is worded, there will always be an ambiguous situation—one in which it will be unclear who has the right-of-way. Such a situation is referred to in electronics as a metastable state.

How long does it take for a metastable state to resolve? The answer is it can take an indefinite length of time; there is no upper limit on the time it can take. However, each situation has a property—the metastability time constant^(1)—that tells us how fast the metastable condition will resolve with a certain probability. Two vehicles with computer-controlled automation may resolve the situation in microseconds; two dull humans may take tens of seconds.

Even the sport of basketball can be pestered with this problem, as [this video](https://youtu.be/qwTOG6CGRXI) demonstrates.

Now, why do I mention this phenomenon called metastability? I mention it because the latest research reveals that our universe exhibits behaviors very similar to the phenomenon of metastability. We are like that basketball, precariously balanced on the rim in the video above. Physicists and astronomers marvel at the fact that a plethora of characteristics are just right for intelligent life like us humans to exist. Some parameters are tuned to an accuracy of one part in 10^(120)! And they exist at multiple levels, from the universe's fundamental constants, to fortuitous ""coincidences"" such as the [triple-alpha resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process#Resonances) that gives us the abundant carbon necessary for life, to the serendipitous qualities of water as the perfect solvent [1](http://www.cemag.us/article/2007/10/water-perfect-solvent-or-poor-solvent),  [2](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/watersol.html).

Scientists and philosophers have to attempt to explain how it could be that our universe would ""just happen"" to be characterized by such wildly improbable parameters and conditions. The most straightforward explanation is simply that its special design was designed by a Designer, which sounds uncomfortably like it belongs in God's wheelhouse. Heaven forbid! We must find another explanation!

And so they did. It's called the [many worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation), in which there exists an infinitude of universes of all manner of fundamental parameters and characteristics. At every instant, each of the infinitude of universes splits into yet another infinitude of possible paths forward in time. However, only the ones that have the ""Goldilocks"" just-right characteristics that permit intelligent life to evolve will be observed, because only they will possess observers! The astute observer will note that these other supposed universes are definitionally undetectable, and thus are super- or extra-natural, and so are excluded from science by the BDMNP. But that does not stop scientists from embracing the many-worlds interpretation. But why would they prefer the supernatural many-worlds interpretation to the supernatural God interpretation? I suggest it's because the former has none of the baggage that accompanies the God idea: moral obligation and all that stuff.

Anyhow, back in the '70's, a curious phenomenon I noticed while performing checkout on the [CDC Cyber-203](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_Cyber#Cyber_200_series) computer one night caught my eye. I was tracking down an intermittent error, the worst kind to isolate. After hours of chasing, I found myself looking at the culprit metastable signal on an oscilloscope, produced because a signal path was too long from one clocked register to the next and so the signal was ""slicing the clock"". But when I triggered the 'scope on the metastable signal, I noticed that as I adjusted the delay on the trigger, the failing signal would move with the trigger and simply fade into oblivion.

Let me use the basketball example to explain what I was seeing. Imagine that we have a player at the free-throw line, shooting hundreds of millions of free-throws, one at a time, and you are an observer who has been tasked with reporting whether each free-throw attempt was successful. However, after a few hundred free-throws you get bored and decide to build a machine to automatically record the outcome of each attempt. Your machine has a switch that will be activated if the ball goes through the hoop, and others that are activated if the ball falls anywhere outside the hoop. You decide on a reasonable time to wait for the ball to complete its journey; let's say you give it 3 seconds from the toss. But you find a complication: every few hundred free-throws, none of the switches are activated. Undaunted, you set up a video camera to photograph what happens in those instances. You discover the situation in the above video: the ball balances on the hoop, and right as the video is triggered, the ball is falling down, either in the hoop or outside. Well, you say, it always resolves right as the video begins, so all I need to do is wait an extra second before recording the result. Upon waiting 4 seconds instead of 3, you see far fewer failures; nevertheless, you still see a rare case where no switch is triggered. The video camera results look just the same as before: right as the video is triggered, the ball is falling down, either in the hoop or outside. So you set the delay to 5 seconds. The failures get rarer, but the video camera results still look exactly the same!

What is happening? It's that, although the metastable situation can take any amount of time to resolve, the *likelihood* of it taking a long time is much smaller than the likelihood of it taking a short time. It's an exponentially decreasing function of time. So no matter how much time you give the metastability to resolve, *almost all* of the video shots will record that the metastability is resolving right as the trigger occurs.

So here's the analogy: Each free-throw toss is one of the infinitude of universes in the many-worlds interpretation. The metastability is the fine-tuning of all the many aspects of each universe, and the time that the ball balances on the hoop is the time that each universe is tuned such that it is on the path to evolving towards intelligent life like us. The great, great majority of universes never exhibit any metastability at all. Of those that achieve metastability for, let's say 100 years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Of those that achieve metastability for 1000 years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Of those that achieve metastability for a million years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Whatever amount of time you select, the vast majority of the universes that achieve that length of metastability time will be on the verge of collapsing, and will be in the process of doing so as they are observed.

So what is our situation? We inhabit one of the universes that manages to hang on until intelligence emerges. Of all the universes that do this, we do not live in a special one; rather, ours is typical of all the universes that survive long enough for observers to begin observing. And what should our eyes behold? We should see the universe disintegrating before our horrified eyes as we, like almost all universes that make it this far, collapse into a fireball. Notice, this should have happened, not now, but back when observers first began observing (whenever that was).

But this did not happen. I don't know how much longer our universe will continue before He decides to close the curtain, but the very facts that it has survived this long, and that it shows no signs of cataclysm just yet, are sufficient to debunk the many-worlds interpretation.

What interpretation does that leave us?

In biological science the definition of an organic species is a group of individual organisms, a population, that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. One species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring.

Now creationists agree that some random changes do occur in the genomes of living organisms do to the fact that DNA reproduction is carried out in a Brownian solution and automatic nature of chemical bonding, and that those gradual changes can effect biological elements within the organism. For example leg length, disease resistance, colouration etc..

So can some creationist biochemist / geneticist with understanding of the process of DNA reproduction please tell me what is the mechanism that prevents gradual change to the genome of a population to such an extent that it can no longer mate with a common ancestor. Specifically what is the biological mechanism that prevents speciation as defined by the biological sciences.

So I though I'd just start with a tiny side topic to start this discussion. And I want a direct answer from /u/No-Karma-II as to how the hell you would come to another conclusion using whatever kind of logic.


 


[The fossil record for humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils) is fairly well put together at this point, with many transitional fossils of human-like apes that no longer live today.

* They have all extensively, directly and indirectly been dated. The oldest cranium being around 7 Mya. Among the fossils there are more than **60** pretty much fully formed skulls, all between ten thousands of years or millions of years old.

436,The statistical improbability of human extinction being caused by an Error Catastrophe or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Mutation.,8,True,"For whatever reason Mr. /u/No-Karma-II has made two posts about Error Catastrophes and why he thinks they would disprove human evolution. So with some very basic science, a tiny bit of logic, and a buttload of math, I will once and for all put an end to his concerns.

 

First of all we are chucking all VSDMs (very slightly deleterious) out with window, not even considering them because:

 

> [VSDMs are usually invisible to selection, since they reside below the ""noise floor"" (see graph).](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/559nry/on_error_catastrophe_reprise_with_documentation/d8el5ii)

 

As /u/No-Karma-II pointed out VSDMs basically don't detract from a creature's survival rate, so if it doesn't effect the survival rate it won't/can't lead to an error catastrophe.

 

How harmful to species survival are mutations exactly? Well, that depends on where the mutation occurs, the DNA in our body doesn't have quantum entanglement, a change in once cell will only be spread to the cells that descend from that cell. So if I have mutant cells in my lungs, yeah that is bad for me, but my offspring can't inherit those, unless those mutations were present in all of my cells due to a mutation in the germline cells that resulted in my birth. We will come back to this later.

 

I cited [this paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/156/1/297) about the estimated mutation rate of the human genome in a reply in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/54ucim/on_error_catastrophe/d871ykx) To summarize humans experience ~175 mutations per generation (a period of 20 years) and of those the *U* (number of deleterious mutations) is 3.

 

So the percentage of mutations that are deleterious per generation is only 1.71428571429%. That is a small percent. That number will continue to grow smaller as we consider other factors. As I mentioned the only time these mutations will truly harm the species is if they are passed from parent to offspring. For this to occur the deleterious mutation in question has to happen in a germline cell. According to [this paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23829164) there are estimated to be ""3.72 × 10^13"" cells in the human body. That is 37.2 trillion cells. How every, finding the exact number of germiline cells in the male body is basically impossible, it seems like no one has done the research, so, I'm going to pull some math out of my butt, but it will be the best math.

 

To help the creationist(statically speaking) I will use the smallest average weight for males that are 20 years of age, so that way germline cells will make up a greater percentage of cells in the body.

 

Average 20 year old male weighs 72 kilograms. This is equal to 71287.13 cubic centimeters, and because the metric system is awesome this means the human body is 71287.13 milliliters. A human testicle is typically 15 to 25 ml in volume. To help the creationist I will use larger value of 25ml. So 50ml is 0.070138887622492% of 71287.13 ml. So 0.07% of a male body is germline cells. Well 0.07% of 37.2 trillion cells gives us only 26,040,000,000 male cells in which a mutation matters. 

 

So let's help the creationist out and ignore the fact that having all 3 of the harmful mutations occur in only .07% of the cells that matter is basically impossible. Even if all 3 deleterious mutations occurred in only the germline cells of the male body, that is 1.1520737327189 × 10^-8 % of cells carrying the harmful mutations. Now the average ejaculation of a fertile male releases between ~ 200,000,000 500,000,000 sperm. However only 1 sperm can fertilize an egg. So only 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm will fertilize an egg. I'm not even going to bother calculating how small the chances are that the 1.15 × 10^-8 % of deleterious mutation carrying cells will be part of that 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm that will fertilize an egg, but a logical guess tells me it would be pretty damn small.

 

Well a generation in the paper I cited is 20 years. I don't know very many people that reproduce within the first 15 years of their life, so only 1/4^th of the mutations will even matter if they occur in the sperm cells themselves. So it is possible that only 2.8801843317972 × 10^-9 % of the sperm could potentially be a part of that 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm that will fertilize an egg. Again, I don't have to tell you how small that number would be.

 

Now I'm not saying that that is the statistical chance of passing on a mutation, but that could potential be the lowest chance, if we ignore other factors like is the ejaculation happening during the female ovulation cycle, is birth control being used, is the male even having sex or is he masturbating? All of those could also decrease likelihood of the deleterious mutation being passed on.

 

I could do the same math as I did for the testicles with regard to female germline cells, but this would be fallacious. Ovaries aren't testicles. [“Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest are wasted.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary#Ovarian_aging) 

 

So in females, even assuming the unlikelihood of all 3 deleterious mutations occurring in only the germline cells, only 0.0003% of those germline cells will contain deleterious mutations, statically speaking. I'm not going to do the math, but the chances that 0.0003% of germline cells carrying deleterious mutations are also part of the 0.05% of germline cells that ovulate is incredibly small.

 

I could dig even deeper into the topic and mention how recessive and dominated traits could potentially make the mutation even less likely to matter. I could mention that gametes are haploid, so only half of the cells being created by a mutated gametocytes would even carry that mutation. But, I think the math we have done so far speaks for itself and I can conclude sooner rather than later...

 

So, even with giving the creationist the advantage by having all 3 mutations occurring solely in germline cells, and assuming those 3 mutations are in separate germline cells, and making germline cells the largest number possible(in males) we can't get a percentage of deleterious mutations high enough to cause an error catastrophe in the human species. Sorry /u/No-Karma-II but the theory of evolution has nothing to fear when it comes to human mutations.",1475930966,123,2016-10-08 08:49:26

So this is a little tangential to the normal fare here, but I thought it might make for a good discussion.

Remember those dinosaur fossils with the soft tissues found a while back? Well the guy running CSU's electron microscopy lab,Mark Armitage, analyzed a Tricertops horn containing soft fibrillar sheets and then published a [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065128113000020) in *Acta Histochemica* claiming it dated to the Biblical flood.

~~He got fired~~ The University elected not to renew his contract and Armitage sued the University claiming he was terminated for his creationist views, they just settled. 

My question here is, was the University in the wrong and should they have settled?

The way I see it, he wasn't let go for being a creationist, he was let go for being a bad scientist and embarrassing the University - and I think the University was justified in doing it. Granted, he's a bad scientist *because* he's a creationist, just like a homeopath is a bad doctor because they're a homeopath.

If he were an economics professor, for example, nobody would care that he was a creationist, it wouldn't compromise his ability to do his job. But he wasn't in the econ department, nor was he publishing long debunked fringe views in economics journals.

Or maybe it was just budgetary considerations like the University claims.

443,On Error Catastrophe (reprise) With Documentation,0,True,"Wikipedia defines [error catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_catastrophe) in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism goes extinct:

> ""Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [...] as a result of excessive mutations.""

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/54ucim/on_error_catastrophe/) article, /u/DarwinZDF42 (I'm dying to know what ZDF42 means) defines ""error catastrophe"" in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism is already experiencing population decline:

> ""Error catastrophe is when^(1) the mutation rate is sufficiently high that deleterious mutations accumulate to the point where the average reproductive output, i.e. the average number of viable offspring produced by each member of a population, fall[s] below one, so that over time the number of reproducing individuals in a population shrinks, and eventually that population goes extinct.""

(by the way, these definitions should not be confused with the term as coined by Leslie Orgel in 1963, which is a totally different and obsolete definition)

With your permission, I would like to slightly redefine error catastrophe for the purposes of this article so that it is identified earlier and reflects the original cause of the condition:

> ""Error catastrophe is the genetic condition in which deleterious mutations are accumulating over successive generations at a rate that is faster than selection can eliminate them.""

In other words, error catastrophe occurs when the genome's genetic load is ever-increasing. The organism may still possess reproductive excess that allows it to prosper for many generations without having its population growth rate fall below one, at which point it fits /u/DarwinZDF42's definition. Nevertheless, its doom is sure as soon as its genetic load is irreversibly on the increase.

In 1950, H.J. Muller (later creator of ""Muller's Ratchet"") published a paper^(2) that sounded an early alarm regarding the threat that deleterious mutations pose to human survival. Among other scary things, he said:

> ""it is evident that the natural rate of mutation of man is so high, and his natural rate of reproduction so low, that not a great deal of margin is left for selection [...] if **u** [the number of mutations per individual per generation] has the minimal value of 0.1 [...] an average reproductive rate of 2.4 children per individual would be necessary [...] without taking any account whatever of all the deaths and failures to reproduce for non-genetic causes""

Note that Muller is predicting problems when u = 0.1, that is, for every ten offspring, nine inherit NO mutations, and the tenth has ONE! I could cite many more quotes from the same paper that make it clear that a value for u of 0.5 or more would ensure the extinction of the human race.

---

As early as 1957, J.B.S. Haldane pointed out in his paper^(3) that selection has a reproductive cost that must be paid. The cost is paid in the form of reproductive excess that dies in order to meet certain requirements. Several requirements are identified: (1) mutation; (2) segregation; (3) balancing; (4) substitution; and of course (5) random. Mutation deaths are the deaths that concern us here. Any modification in the genome by mutation, whether it be beneficial or deleterious, exacts a cost. The beneficial mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do not* inherit the mutation in order to achieve ""fixation"" of the mutation, and conversely, deleterious mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do* inherit the mutation. The deaths need not be in the first generation, and usually are not, but the deaths must eventually occur. Note that it does not matter how overt or subtle the phenomic effects are; if the mutation is to be propagated or extinguished, the cost of doing so must be paid (this cost-based analysis led Haldane to conclude that there is not enough reproductive excess in many animals, including man, to pay the costs associated with fixing any realistic number of beneficial mutations necessary for our evolution in the time allotted of several million years, but that is not the thesis of this article). The number of deaths that are required to fix a beneficial mutation is dependent on how fast it is to fix; as an extreme example, if it is to fix in one generation, all other members of the population must die in that generation! Typically, though, fixation occurs over many generations (Haldane estimated 300) and the cost is much lower. For deleterious mutations, the cost can be just one death—the death of the original offspring—or more if it occurs in later generations. In any case, all offspring that inherit the deleterious mutation must die if it is to be extinguished.

---

One surprising thing I learned in researching this article is the reason why non-coding DNA was immediately termed ""junk"": it was necessary for it to be useless because if it was, then the effects of deleterious mutations would be more manageable. By declaring 99% of the genome that is non-coding to be ""junk"", the target size for deleterious mutations was reduced 100-fold:

> ""we believe the conclusion is inevitable that in the human genome, nucleotide substitution has an appreciable effect on fitness in only a small fraction of DNA sites, possibly less than 1% of the total.""^(4)

---

In 1964, H.J. Muller published the paper^(5) for which he is best known, in which he described the mechanism that came to be known as ""Muller's Ratchet"":

> ""an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that [...] lines become more heavily loaded with mutation.""

Muller's Ratchet asserts that deleterious mutations in asexually reproducing organisms, once fixed, cannot be removed, because the genome reproduces as an indivisible unit. In the same paper, he advanced the concept of a ""selection floor"" [my term], stating that there is a minimum absolute value for selection's effectiveness, below which the effect is so subtle that it becomes invisible to selection:

> ""There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.), but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis [...] although deserving of it.""

[This image](http://imgur.com/a/H1TG0) illustrates the characteristics of selection as Muller described them. Notice three things:

* There are many more slightly beneficial/deleterious mutations than strongly so;
* Mutations whose effect is smaller than a certain threshold become invisible to selection—they will NEVER be removed. This is akin to a whisper uttered across the hall at a rock concert. Another analogy, illustrating the effects of these VSDMs and how they accumulate, would be rust on a car. Although the individual VSDMs are invisible to selection, their aggregate would be; the problem, though, is that the aggregates are evenly distributed over the general population, so that selection can only choose among many equally ""rusty"" genomes.
* The deleterious mutations greatly outnumber the the beneficial mutations of equal effect. The ratio is commonly said to be 1000:1 or greater.

Muller discussed the action of his ""ratchet"" only as it applied to asexual reproduction, since sexual reproduction can ameliorate its effects through swapping of linkage blocks, which are typically about 20,000 base pairs long. Although reduced in effect, Muller's ratchet still applies to meiosis because all mutations in a linkage block still are treated as a unit. And in any case, Muller's ratchet will express its fullest damaging effect on reproduction of the human mitochondrial DNA, which reproduces via mitosis of the female ovum.

---

In 1968, Motoo Kimera publishes a paper^(6) with some truly shocking numbers. He says:

> ""in the evolutionary history of mammals, nucleotide substitution has been so fast that, on average, one nucleotide pair has been substituted in the population roughly every two years. This figure is in sharp contrast to Haldane’s well-known estimate [... which states that] a new allele may be substituted in a population every 300 generations""

and

> ""at the rate of one substitution every two years [...] the substitutional load becomes so large that no mammalian species could tolerate it""

which is my working definition of error catastrophe, and

> ""This brings us to the rather surprising conclusion [... that] the mutation rate per generation for neutral mutations amounts to roughly [...] four per zygote""

As we shall see, Kimera was still way low on his estimate of the number of mutations per offspring per generation, but even his low estimate caused him serious concern. In order to digest this disheartening information, he had to conclude that most mutations are neutral and thus hidden to selection. But this ignores the fact that deleterious VSDMs outnumber advantageous VSDMs by at least 1000:1, so these hidden mutations must necessarily be wreaking havoc, not inexorably marching up the hill of complexity.

In 1983, Kimera published^(7) his famous neutral theory. Although mechanisms have since been discovered that could account for neutral evolution, Kimera's impetus for proposing the theory was not so much evidence that it occurs as it was the absolute necessity that it exist to salvage the evolutionary paradigm:

> ""This formula shows that as compared to Haldane’s formula the cost is larger by about 2 [...] under the assumption that the majority of mutation substitutions at the molecular level are carried out by positive selection [...] to maintain the same population number and still carry out mutant substitutions [...] each parent must leave [...] 3.27 million offspring to survive and reproduce. This was the main argument I used when I presented the neutral mutation-random drift hypothesis of molecular evolution.""

Wow! Let that sink in... every parent must leave 3.27 MILLION offspring! This is to prevent error catastrophe. This is why I claim that error catastrophe is a serious danger for higher organisms that exhibit low fecundity; they just don't have the excess offspring to pay the costs of mutation selection.

So the neutral theory is absolutely necessary, whether the evidence confirms it or not, for evolution to be a viable theory. And what would happen if we were to discover that mutations occur at higher rates than four per zygote?

---

In 1986, a scientific paper^(8) DID report significantly higher mutation rates (although later research would find even these to over-optimistically favor evolution):

> ""gamete rates for point mutations [... are] on the order of 30 per generation [...]. The implications of mutations of this magnitude for population genetics and evolutionary theory are profound. The first response of many population geneticists is to suggest that most of these occur in ""silent"" DNA and are of no real biological significance. Unfortunately for that line of reasoning [...] the amount of silent DNA is steadily shrinking. The question of how our species accommodates such mutation rates is central to evolutionary thought.""

So, initial predictions were that the rate of mutation occurrence, **u**, could be no higher than 0.1 for there to be any hope that natural selection could sort and manage them to avoid error catastrophe. Then it grew to 1, 2 and 4, with appropriate accompanying alarm. Meanwhile, the problem is being exacerbated by a shrinking percentage of ""junk"" DNA, making the target for random point mutations grow.

---

Then in 1995 came the paper^(9) that asks the question that every creationist asks: ""Why have we not died 100 times over"", if we've been evolving for millions of years? Some of his comments:

> ""Tachida^([10]) (1990) concluded that VSDMs (very slight deleterious mutations) impairing only one function—its interaction with nucleosomes—may lead to too high a mutation load""

> ""Lande^([11]) (1994) and Lynch^([12]) et al. (1994) [...] concluded [... that] VSDMs can rapidly drive the population to extinction""

> ""Simultaneous selection against many mutations can lead to further decline of Ne and facilitate extinction (Li^([13]) 1987; Lynch^([12]) et al. 1994).""

> ""I interpret the results in terms of the whole genome and show, in agreement with Tachida^([10]) (1990), that VSDMs can cause too high a mutation load, even when Ne = 10^(6)-10^(7) [...] conditions under which the load may be paradoxically high are quite realistic""

> ""the load can become excessive even when U < 1 [...] as my analysis suggests—contamination by VSDMs implies an excessive load, leading to stochastic mutation load paradox.

> ""accumulation of VSDMs in a lineage [...] acts like a time bomb [...] **the existence of vertebrate lineages [...] should be limited to 10^(6)-10^(7) generations**.

Throughout the paper, this problem is referred to as the ""stochastic mutation load paradox"". It is a paradox only because long-term evolution is not true, but that will NEVER be acknowledged, unless some other **naturalistic** theory displaces it. This has been the situation throughout the decades. Similarly, gaps in the fossil record were denied until Niles and Eldridge concocted their ""Punctuated Equilibria"" tale in 1981, at which time the gaps were openly acknowledged.

Kondrashov followed this paper with yet another^(14) in 2002. In it, the mutation rate per offspring per generation was set to the (minimum) value at which it remains today:

> ""The total number of new mutations per diploid human genome per generation is about 100 [...] at least 10% of these are deleterious [...] analysis of human variability suggests that a normal person carries thousands of deleterious alleles""

Notice: One hundred is 1,000 times the value that early evolutionists calculated was tolerable without experiencing error catastrophe!

And how long would it take for the human genome to take on ""thousands"" of (let's say 5,000) deleterious alleles? At only 25 per generation and a generation period of 30 years, it would take only **6,000 years**! Does that ring a bell?

---

The story is not finished. I can give a half-dozen more significant papers since 2000 that nail the coffin shut on evolution. But I'm tired of writing and I'm afraid you won't read it anyhow. After all, I am a computer design engineer, not an EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST, so what can I know?

But if you ask, I'll post another (slightly shorter) article discussing them.

The math works. But attempts to demonstrate that it can actually happen have been, at best, inconclusive. Here's some detail: The fastest mutating organisms on earth are RNA viruses, that is, viruses with RNA genomes, as opposed to DNA genomes like ours. RNA is less stable that DNA, and the copying machinery for RNA is less precise [my off-topic comment: this is a problem for the RNA world], so RNA mutates faster. No population of RNA viruses in nature has been shown to experience error catastrophe, and while RNA viruses can be driven to extinction in the lab by treating them with mutagens, it has not been conclusively shown that the extinction is due specifically to this mechanism.""

He continues on to give more detail. I think this is an area of specialization for this excellent evolutionary biologist.

Nevertheless, I disagree with him, though. Error catastrophe is more likely to occur in complex, ""low-fecundity"" organisms than in ultra-simple organisms (viruses are not even a form of life) that breed faster than rabbits. The reason is that these ""higher"" organisms are already stressed because, in Haldane's cost-based budgeting system, higher organisms have fewer excess offspring to sacrifice to selection. Simple, fecund organisms like viruses can often sacrifice 99% of their offspring to selection.

As I've mentioned in other articles, the latest estimates are that humans suffer **over 100 mutations per offspring per generation**. Most of these mutations are either neutral or very slightly deleterious (VSDMs), thankfully, but deleterious mutations are perhaps 1000 times more numerous than equivalently beneficial mutations. That means that humans are being loaded with deleterious mutations far faster than they can hope to select them out.

Quantifying the effects of this influence can be difficult, but we need merely look at the birth rates in many nations as evidence, and even the plummeting global birth rate. While it is true that much of this can be attributed to conscious efforts at preventing overpopulation, it is still also true that world citizens seem to have lost their drive to reproduce. Parenthood is scary to enter into and lacks clear personal benefits, and I can only imagine what it's like for a woman to dread that first childbirth experience. But like other animals, humans have always had an innate drive to procreate that overcomes these fears. We're losing that drive. Perhaps the clearest example of this is Japan. An article asks, [""Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex?""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex) And for those who do have sex, most think that the purpose of sex is recreation not procreation, and pregnancy is a disease to be avoided. The drive to maintain the line is being lost. Other problems are mounting, too: allergies, which are caused by an immune system gone awry, are on the rise. The allergies are to things that have long been in the environment like pollen, dust, grass, corn, fish and peanuts, not to new artificial man-made chemicals (except perhaps latex). Why is our fine-tuned immune system going out of tune? I suggest that it's VSDMs.

And in the animal world among higher animals, the situation is no better. Although many extinctions can be blamed on loss of habitat, many cannot—they simply cannot reproduce effectively. Error catastrophe is a likely cause.

447,Alu SINES may have significant function,7,True,"11% of the human genome is made of Alu SINE elements, ad 300 bp sequence that is repeated in numerous places in the genome.

Evolutionist like Ayala argue Alu's are most certainly junk especially because new copies of them in the genome are known to cause birth defects.  He can't imagine they do much either.

>Perhaps one could attribute the obnoxious presence of the Alu sequences to degenerative biological processes that are not the result of ID. But was the Designer incompetent or malevolent in not avoiding the eventuality of this degeneration? -- Francisco Ayala
 one of the world’s leading evolutionary biologists


Ah, but that was mere 6 years ago, in 2010. What do we know in light now of laboratory experiments just a few years later? A back of the envelope calculation demonstrates that the Alu units which Ayala considered degenerate trash are now realized to have the potential to collectively implement 10^16 bytes of information in the brain and nervous system.

Here is the supporting documentation. First the computer RAM analogy to Alus as published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences:


>These findings bring to mind information storage models. As the number of potential editing sites in each Alu-containing transcript is high, usually several dozens, the potential for combinatorial encrypted information is enormous. Binary use of A or I in millions of sites in the neural cell transcriptome can be considered equivalent to the 0’s and 1’s used for information storage and processing by computers. It is tempting to speculate that the more abundant RNA editing found in the human brain may contribute to the more advanced human capabilities such as memory, learning, and cognition. This suggestion is consistent with the hypothesis that the advantage of complex organisms lies in the development of a digital programming system based on noncoding RNA signaling (46, 56). The combinatorial posttranscriptional RNA editing of noncoding sequences may therefore contribute to higher brain functions and may play a role in the evolution of human specialization.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901480/ 

How enormous? For one cell enormous, for a billion cells enormoser!


>A-to-I RNA editing occurs at over a hundred million genomic sites, located in a majority of human genes
>….
>With these results, A-to-I editing becomes the most comprehensively characterized post transcriptional modification. The massive number of Alu editing events dwarfs the few known functional and conserved editing events within the coding regions, and accounts for >99% of all ADAR deamination reactions. The fact that such a heavy burden was not selected against raises
 the possibility that a fraction of the plethora of Alu editing sites may have been utilized, in ways that remain unknown (Mattick 2009; Paz-Yaacov et al. 2010), in the course of primate evolution. 

If there are approximately 1 billion brain cells, and 100 million bits of information being stored in each cell through the Alu-generated transcripts, using a back-of-the envelope calculation, the combined information storage capacity of the Alu-generated transcripts is on the order of : 10^17 bits which is 1.25 x 10^16 bytes. By way of comparison, a recent estimate of the brains storage capacity based on was suggested at 2.5 x 10^15 bytes. From Scientific American:
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/

Another news report in 2010 regarding work at the Stanford Universitiy Medical Center:


>the brain’s overall complexity is almost beyond belief, said [Dr. Stephen] Smith. “One synapse, by itself, is more like a microprocessor — with both memory-storage and information-processing elements — than a mere on/off switch. In fact, one synapse may contain on the order of 1,000 molecular-scale switches. A single human brain has more switches than all the computers and routers and Internet connections on Earth,”

Are you serious, ZDF42?

These simple diagrams do not provide the explanation I am seeking. [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus), a Christian and considered the founder of taxonomy, classified animals according to their similarities before Darwin even made the scene. Classification of objects into hierarchical trees is a very useful activity, and it helps us process a large amount of data with minimum effort. But products of intelligent design (and in fact, pretty much any collections of objects) can also be classified. You perform this task every time you organize the junk drawer in your kitchen.

---

The issue I am addressing stems from my understanding of information space and the distances that separate points in that space. Information space is N-dimensional, where N is typically very large, comprising all the variables in the space (e.g., for the human genome there are 6 billion bits, so N=6 billion; N for the information space that would contain ALL genomes is unimaginably large!). Over my career as a computer design engineer, I have had to deal with many such spaces, and it has intrigued me how similar these spaces appear in many disparate applications. What I know about DNA and its coding tells me that it is similar in biology as well. In fact, I can't imagine how it could be different—such is the nature of information.

Information spaces that I have encountered have always had similar types of layout. It fact, the similarities are innate characteristics of information spaces. The reliable operation of the computers we all use every day relies on firm understanding of these similarities in concept. For example, [error detection and correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction) utilizes these principles. If the information space can be configured such that all legal data points are at least two ""hops"" (i.e., mutations) apart, then the system can perform single-error detection (SED) on any single error (mutation), because a single hop will always land on an illegal location. Similarly, if they are all three hops apart, the system can not only detect single single errors, it can correct them[!] (single-error correction--SEC), because every legal data point is surrounded by illegal data points that no other legal data point can reach in a single hop. Four hop distances achieves single-error correction AND double-error detection ([SECDED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code#Hamming_codes_with_additional_parity_.28SECDED.29)), and so on.

As I said, the dimension, N, is typically very large. To permit visualization, though, let's consider a 2-dimensional map space. On this map space—imagine a map of the earth—some points are easy to get to from a specific starting point, and some are more difficult. Some connections can be made by walking, some require bridges to traverse, and some cannot be traversed without a ship. So let's say that on this map, the watery locations represent illegal points in the data space (an ""illegal"" point in DNA's information space would be a genome that expresses an unfit phenome), and our ""hops"" represent mutations. Also, let's say that there are no bridges or ships (which is true for DNA). You must hop—mutate—to wherever you want to go. Small hops are easy and frequent, but occasionally you can, with more effort, perform a ""double-hop"" to cross a small body of water. VERY rarely, you can, with tremendous effort, execute a ""triple-hop"". Anything more is unreasonable to expect.

You can probably see where I'm going. It is not enough to show that you can hop from Chicago to Milwaukee, even if you can do that quickly and you have all the time you want to go other places. You'll never get to Bermuda or Hawaii by hopping, no matter how much time you have, because the huge gulf cannot be hopped. And this is a common characteristic of information spaces—they are populated with ""continents"" and ""islands"" of legal (valid, useful, functional) points, separated from each other by vast oceans of illegality or nonsense.

The closest analogy to the information space of genomes is probably the information space of books. Many times, blocks of text are used as analogies to elucidate genetic concepts. Maynard Smith used the WORD => WORE => GORE => GONE => GENE sequence to illustrate how point mutations might totally modify a gene's makeup (but it only works on short, carefully selected words). Richard Dawkins used the ""methinks it is like a weasel"" phrase from Hamlet to illustrate (in a flawed manner) how evolution might progress (flawed because his algorithm requires teleology—prior knowledge of the goal—which natural selection does not possess). Stephen Hawking used the analogy of an infinitude of monkeys randomly typing out a Shakespearean sonnet (or anything else, no matter how long, an infinitude of times!) to illustrate how infinite time overcomes all probabilistic obstacles (however, our time has been finite). Likewise, I will use text as an analogy.

As I mentioned earlier, the information space that contains all books ever written is awesomely large, and almost all of the space is incoherent gibberish. If I had to guess, I would have to say that all but perhaps 10^(-1,000,000) of the space is nonsensical, and 10^(-1,000,000,000) of the space is occupied by anything anyone ever actually wrote. The oceans between coherent combinations of letters cannot be traversed by accident. That is why a student can be properly accused of plagiarism if he repeats something another author wrote without crediting him.

In fact, even though a book-sized piece of text is the proper analogy to a genome, we don't have to go that far to see the phenomenon I'm trying to highlight in action. You can see it in paragraphs or even in sentences, or even in single words! To illustrate this, I wrote a program to test this out on the information space that contains all English words of 18 letters or less.

Here's what I did: I downloaded a copy of the entire official Scrabble^(®) word list—all 172,880 of them. There are words there that you'll never use or encounter, like ""bigeminies"", ""koumysses"", ""solonetzic"" and ""deuteranomolous"". Using a richly populated word list makes my results as conservative as possible. I then wrote a program that calculates the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) (equivalent to the number of ""mutations"" it takes to get from one word to the other) between every word and every other word, a total of (172,880) * (172,879) ≈ 30 billion calculations, which took several days to calculate on my PC. I was then able to scan the results and find out how ""isolated"" various word groups were from each other. It was very enlightening, but the most significant result was that, in order to get from any word to any other word (as evolution claims, due to common descent), I had to perform at least one ""hexa-hop"", which involves performing six simultaneous mutations in one hop. That's one third of the word that had to be changed (since the source and destination were no more than 18 letters long)!

The situation is near-infinitely worse for the information space that contains all possible genomes. I see no way that the oceans of incoherent junk can be traversed in such a sparsely populated information space!

If you think it can, it'd better be on the basis of some actual data, not a set of hand-waving charts.

And if you think neutral evolution can solve this for you, I'll have to do a similar discussion on why that's pie-in-the-sky daydreaming.

449,The Evolution of Caffeine - this is SO COOL,14,True,"I just had to post this. A paper was recently published on the evolution of caffeine biosynthesis. It touches on a bunch of things we've been discussing recently. Caffeine biosynthesis is something that has evolved independently multiple times, starting with the same precursor and ending with the same product, but using different enzymes along the way. 

 

And how did these pathways come to be? By the processes we've been talking about: exaptation and specialization. And even better, caffeine biosynthesis is a three-step process. It's exactly the kind of complex trait that we often hear can't evolve. Well, here it is, a specific example of such a pathway, having evolved three separate times.

[In the following quotes, all emphases via italics and bolding are mine]

---

Here is a quote from the abstract for one of the articles provided to me, [The Origins of the RNA World](http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/5/a003608.long):

> A thorough consideration of this “RNA-first” view of the origin of life must reconcile concerns regarding the intractable [hard to control or deal with] mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. **Perhaps these concerns will eventually be resolved**, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, **the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved**, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.

Later in the same article the authors state:

> Scientists interested in the origins of life seem to divide neatly into two classes. The first, usually but not always molecular biologists, *believe* that RNA must have been the first replicating molecule and that chemists are exaggerating the difficulties of nucleotide synthesis. They *believe* that **a few more striking chemical “surprises”** will establish that a pool of racemic mononucleotides could have formed on the primitive Earth, and that further experiments with different activating groups, minerals, and chiral amplification processes will solve the **enantiomeric cross-inhibition problem**. The second group of scientists are much more **pessimistic**. They believe that **the de novo appearance of oligonucleotides on the abiotic Earth would have been a near miracle**. Time will tell which is correct.

This is not a dispute over which of two very promising candidates is the actual solution; rather, the strongest argument for each proposition is the obvious weakness of the other. In point of fact, **both** positions are extremely weak, with seemingly insuperable obstacles to solution. If one is not, as I am not, restricted by marriage to the MN presupposition to consider only spontaneous-generation options, one would reject both as near-impossible. At the very least, the MN-bound scientist should be free to admit that neither proposition is currently tenable.

Elsewhere in the same article:

> A more **tenuous argument** can be made regarding whether life on Earth began with RNA.

In my experience, when an evolutionary biologist categorizes a pro-evolution argument as ""tenuous"", it can be read as ""near-impossible"". Continuing:

> In what has been referred to as **“The Molecular Biologist's Dream”** (Joyce and Orgel 1993), one **might imagine** that all of the components of RNA were available in some prebiotic pool, and that these components could have assembled into replicating, evolving polynucleotides without the prior existence of any evolved macromolecules. However, a thorough consideration of this “RNA-first” view of the origin of life inevitably triggers **“The Prebiotic Chemist's Nightmare”**, with visions of the intractable mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. **Perhaps this continuing nightmare will eventually have a happy ending**, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is **far from being solved**, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.

Again, the question boils down to: ""which is the **less impossible** of the only two naturalistic alternatives?"" The main driving force behind the search for some mechanism that precedes even RNA seems to be the fact that spontaneous generation of RNA appears to many to be hopeless; it is not driven by some clear hopeful antecedent.

I'm really surprised (actually, not) that you find such encouragement in the activities discussed in the article. Yes, progress has been made, but at every turn, new dilemmas emerge, or old ones are found to more intractable than previously hoped. Some more excerpts:

> Overcoming the **self-structure problem** using the standard C and G nucleotides is **very difficult** because it requires the discovery of conditions that favor the binding of mononucleotides to allow template-directed synthesis to occur, but suppress the formation of long duplex regions that would exclude activated monomers from the template.

Yet another example:

> A related nonenzymatic replication scheme involves synthesis by the ligation of short 3′,5′-linked oligomers (James and Ellington 1999). This is certainly an attractive possibility, made more plausible by the discovery of analogous ribozyme-catalyzed reactions (Bartel and Szostak 1993), but it faces **two major obstacles**. The first is the **difficulty of obtaining the substrates in the first place [!]**. The second is concerned with fidelity. Pairs of oligonucleotides containing a single base mismatch, particularly if the mismatch forms a G•U wobble pair, still hybridize as efficiently as fully complementary oligomers, except in a temperature range very close to the melting point of the perfectly paired structure. **Maintaining fidelity would** therefore **be difficult under any plausible temperature regime**.

Consider the following paragraph, with my remarks inserted in brackets:

> The RNA-first view of the origin of life **assumes** that a supply of activated ß-d-nucleotides [the ""-d-"" means that the nucleotides are enantiopure dextrorotatory, something that my opponents here claim is unnecessary] was available by some **as yet unrecognized abiotic process**. Furthermore, it **assumes** that a[n undiscovered] means existed to convert the activated nucleotides to an ensemble of random-sequence polynucleotides, a subset of which had the ability to replicate [what an assumption!]. It seems to be implicit in the model that such polynucleotides replicate themselves but, for whatever reason, do not replicate unrelated neighbors. It is **not clear** whether replication involves one molecule copying itself (and its complement) or a family of molecules that together copy each other. **These questions are set aside for the moment** in order to first consider the question of whether an RNA molecule of reasonably short length can catalyze its own replication with sufficiently high fidelity [both catalysis rate and fidelity are serious concerns].

At this point, I have only commented on the first quarter of the paper. The remainder is similarly filled with reports of hopeful progress amidst problems at every turn. It would take me another day to list all the problems detailed, but I hope you can see why a reader that is not obligated to find an abiogenetic storyline is not overly impressed.

The last paragraph of the paper, under the title ""Concluding Remarks"", states:

> The **presumed** RNA World should be viewed as a milestone, a plateau in the early history of life on Earth. So too, the concept of an RNA World has been a milestone in the scientific study of life's origins. While **this concept does not explain how life originated**, it has helped to guide scientific thinking and has served to focus experimental efforts. Further progress will depend primarily on new experimental results, as chemists, biochemists, and molecular biologists work together to address problems concerning molecular replication, ribozyme enzymology, and RNA-based cellular processes.

# This Concept Does Not Explain How Life Originated

So, in summary, **this concept does not explain how life originated!**

One final note: take into consideration the fact that this article is written by researchers who derive their funding from sources who are looking for a naturalistic solution to the abiogenesis dilemma. I'm sure the researchers share this goal, but even if they didn't (say they were closet creationists), they cannot come out and report, ""this RNA world idea is unadulterated hogwash"". That would be the end of their funding and their career. Only one outcome is permitted: HOPE.

This [biology textbook](http://imgur.com/a/qf7kb) by Raven & Johnson is one of the most popular college-level general biology textbooks, with over a million copies in print. [Page 420](http://imgur.com/a/xdNSW) is dedicated to the refutation of creationism. Here is a [close-up](http://imgur.com/a/BYeiL) of objection six of the six objections that the authors claim creationists have to evolution. I have re-entered the text below for the this item:

> **Proteins are too improbable.** *""hemoglobin has 141 amino acids in its chain. The probability that the first one would be leucine is 1/20, and that all 141 would be the ones they are by chance is (1/20)^(141), an impossibly rare event!""* This is statistical foolishness—you can not use probability to argue backwards. The probability that a student in a classroom has a particular birthday is 1/365; arguing this way, the probability that everyone in a class of 50 would have the birthdays they do is (1/365)^(50), and yet there the class sits.

---

Right off, we have a problem, because creationists would not choose to discuss hemoglobin, of all proteins. That's the problem that occurs when one side sets up the straw-man to attack as its opponent. Rather, we creationists would choose one (or all!) of the 300 or so proteins that researchers have identified as essential to all life. Let me say that again. These proteins are essential to all life. Evolutionists insist that there is some sort of pre-life evolution that occurs, possibly via RNA. Creationists disagree. But that is a debate for another time. Based on the classroom analogy chosen, we must conclude that the question at hand is whether it makes sense to claim that a long-chain protein as complex as hemoglobin can randomly form spontaneously.

---

I hope you can see the lack of understanding of the principles of ""probability 101"" displayed by the authors of this otherwise fine textbook.

The authors say that ""you can not use probability to argue backwards"". Is that true?

In some cases no, and in others, yes. The crucial question is, what is the likelihood of each class member having the birthday that he in fact possesses? If we are talking about the the people in the actual classroom, they cannot help but have the birthdays that they have, so the probability is not 1/365, but rather exactly one! And the probability that entire class has the birthdays they in fact have will therefore also be exactly one. It cannot be otherwise, because we start out assuming that we are talking about a specific group of people.

But the situation is different for the hemoglobin protein. In this case, we are not trying to determine what the likelihood is that the protein has the specific configuration that it in fact possesses (which would also be exactly one), but we are trying to determine the likelihood that such a configuration would spontaneously form. Here, the entire panoply of possible combinations of amino acids at the 141 loci is in play.

Here is another way to explain:

To be sure, every 141-amino-acid protein chain would have the same extraordinarily low likelihood of occurring spontaneously. But there is a crucial difference between the protein and its classroom analog. The protein exhibits **specified complexity**—that is, there is a special importance attributed to a very specific, very small set of possible configurations of this 141-long chain, because its members can perform the function of oxygen transport. By contrast, the 50 members of the classroom can possess any birthdays, and it would not make any difference.

To illustrate why this is important, let's see what you would think if we started asking the class members what their birthdays were. The first person asked replies that her birthday is January 1^(st). Somewhat remarkable, since that is a unique day with its own special name (Like Christmas and Independence Day). So you ask the second person and his is also New Year's Day. And, you guessed it, all 50 people turn out to have their birthdays on New Year's Day!

Suddenly, your classroom's members turn out to exhibit a mild form of specified complexity. After the third or fourth person reports the same birth date, you would certainly begin to wonder how such an unlikely thing could be. And when you finish and find that all 50, or even 45 of the 50, have that same birth date, you would be certain, and justifiably so, that something other than randomness was afoot. Some possibilities would be: someone is playing a practical joke on you, or this classroom is being convened at a convention for New Year's Babies. This would be a better analogy to the hemoglobin than the mere typical group of 50 people.

---

I do not accuse the authors of a general lack of understanding of the laws of probability. That's highly ""improbable"". Rather, it is a case of localized blindness due to the extreme pro-evolution bias that is pandemic in the scientific community. In any other subject area, they would analyze the situation rationally.

454,Empirical Validation of Phylogenetic Methods,9,True,"One relatively common objection to evolutionary theory is that it is backwards-looking with regard to evolutionary histories. Sure, it *looks* like two species may be related, but how do we *know*? Well, we don’t, we can only say what is most *likely*, and phylogenetics provides the tools to make that assessment. 

 

In a paper titled [“Experimental Phylogenetics: Generation of a Known Phylogeny,” (Science, 1992),](http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol445D_W00/exp_phylo.pdf) David Hillis et al. generated nine populations of bacteriophage from a common ancestor. The relationships among these groups (the true phylogeny) was therefore known. 

 

They then conducted phylogenetic analysis of the nine terminal populations, and reconstructed their phylogeny using five different methods, including neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood. 

 

Each of the five methods they used successfully resulted in reconstruction of the correct phylogeny. There were differences in branch length between the methods, but no differences in terms of the tree topology, i.e. which populations were deemed to be most closely related to each other. This experiment validated the main phylogenetic methods in use at the time, and which are still used today. By demonstrating that phylogenetic methods can accurately reconstruct phylogenies, Hillis et al. demonstrated the validity of methods used to determine evolutionary relationships among extant species.

461,Evolution is accepted in spite of the fact that not a single evolutionary pathway has been documented or theorized in detail,0,True,"## I'm posting this from a buried comment, since I put a bit of work into generating it:

From /u/Simyala:

> > Evolution is accepted in spite of the fact that not a single evolutionary pathway has been documented or theorized in detail
> 
> We don't know the exact genetic mutations that happen.

Evolutionary critics don't expect—at least, I don't—evolutionists to detail every last actual mutation in the pathway that purportedly occurred. But critics like myself don't believe that *any* pathway exists.

And my incredulity is not due to ignorance; it is informed incredulity. This is an information theory problem, whether evolutionary biologists like it or not, and must be examined in that manner. As a computer designer, it's my bread and butter^(1). We use a process very similar to the process of mutation and natural selection to route extremely complex circuit boards and gate arrays. We simply throw all the logic elements of an entire design onto its substrate randomly, and then attempt to route all the ""wires"". The fist attempt is guaranteed to fail, but it gives us a metric—the number of unrouted connections—to use as a starting point. Then we allow the placements of the logic elements to be randomly swapped—mutated, if you will—and we reroute the board. If the number of unrouted connections decreases, we keep the new placement—selection, if you will—and if not, we return to the original. This process is repeated over and over until the circuitry successfully routes or fails altogether. In addition, we perform the placement swaps in a manner that parallels the metallurgical process of [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy\)), wherein a metal is heated and then cooled slowly. In a like manner, we allow the random re-placements of the logic elements to be coarse and radical at first (high-temperature), and then we slowly restrict the re-placements to be more subtle on subsequent iterations. This whole process is like taking a box of corn flakes, or a jar of marbles, and settling the contents by shaking it—vigorously at first, and then progressively more mildly.

A comment on this technique: This is by no means a process that requires no intelligent design input. We have invested years and millions of dollars on a staff of engineers and computer scientists to find innovative methods: separating the placement phase from the routing phase, fine-tuning the annealing process by adjusting the ""temperature"" curve during ""cooling"" process, and coming up with novel solutions to design issues.

Also, this process is not a direct parallel to evolution. The parallel to evolution would do something like taking an existing design—say a radio—and ""evolving"" it into a TV by randomly injecting changes into the design and then selecting the changes that move the unit's performance from that of a radio to that of a TV. This technique has been attempted, albeit on a trivially simple design: the researchers threw some logic on a board and attempted, successfully, to create a circuit that generates a periodic pulse output.

So, what is the difference that makes this technique work on board routing, but not on ""evolution"" from a radio to a TV? The difference is an information theory difference. In the case of the board routing, there is an unimaginably large number of possible solutions, and they are interconnected in N-dimensional solution space by small hops, so the software can randomly navigate the small hops to eventually arrive to an optimal solution (if one exists). In the case of the (radio => TV), the two designs are separated by a huge gulf of inoperable nonsense solutions, so that there are no ""stepping stones"" that allow navigation from the start to the finish.

Although evolutionists have not offered a single pathway for a single evolutionary advance, some of the necessary hops are just absurdly impossible:

* the gecko's ""evolution"" from perfectly adequate clawed-feet to sophisticated but unnecessary pads that exploit Van Der Waals' attraction;
* the frog that gestates its eggs by disabling its digestive juices for weeks, and swallowing(!) the eggs, then regurgitating them as froglets;
* the lampsilis mussel that dangles a perfectly-formed ""lure"" to attract a specific species of fish, so that when the fish attacks the lure, the mussel can expel baby mussels that enter the fish's mouth and attach to the gills as a blood food supply;
* the pacific golden plover, that flies on its maiden nonstop 72-hour voyage, guided entirely by instinct, from the shores of Alaska to the tiny Hawaiian islands, over featureless ocean with no ""stepping stones"" to allow step-by-step evolution of this astonishing odyssey;
* the ogre-faced spider, that spins a net on its legs, then waits for its prey, which it attacks using its net, gladiator-style, to entangle its prey;
* the bolo spider, that throws a glob of silk at passing moths, bolo-style, to capture them;
* the list is endless—need I say more?

# How does the addition of even the possibility of supernatural agency enhance my understanding of the natural world, particularly since the naturalistic theory that I currently use does a pretty fine job?

Explaining nature purely from within nature is an exercise in recursion (self-reference), and recursion has a very poor record of success. Let me pose some questions about nature that cannot be answered from within nature, and you tell me if it is important to you that we find answers to any of them:

* Does the addition of even the possibility of supernatural agency enhance my understanding of the natural world?
* How did the natural world come to be, since it is now [generally agreed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) that it had a beginning? [NOTE: it is also [generally acknowledged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) that many of the universe's independent physical constants, which can take on any value, MUST have the very specific values they possess in order for a plethora of events to occur, such as for galaxies and stars to form and carbon to form (via the [triple-alpha resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process#Resonances)). Many other ""coincidences"" make our universe very special indeed!]
* Are we humans obligated to behave in any particular way in this natural world?
* Is our natural world a mere part of something greater than itself?
* Do humans other than myself feel pain? How about dogs? Dogwoods?

Truly, to answer the most important questions about the natural world, we must look beyond the natural world.

Recursion has failed is in logic, set theory and general mathematics, and it will fail us in science as well.

##In Logic:

Is this statement true or false?

    This statement is true.

If it is true then it is true, and if it is false then it is false. It tells us nothing; therefore, it is a nonsense statement.

Is this statement true or false?

    This statement is false.

If it is true then it is false, and if it is false then it is true. Both cases lead to inconsistency; therefore, it is a nonsense statement.

In both examples, the problem is recursion (self-reference).

##In Set Theory:

Near the end of the 18th century, set theory was developing. Mathematician Georg Cantor was working on what was called ""intuitive set theory"". He defined a set thus:

> A set is any collection into a whole of definite and separate objects of our intuition or our thought.

Notice that this definition is recursive, since sets are, by this definition, themselves set members.

In 1902, another mathematician, Gottlieb Frege, was about to publish the results of his extensive research, when he was contacted by the young mathematician Bertrand Russel, with very bad news: his research was in vain, because Russel could prove that the intuitive set definition led to inconsitencies. He reasoned thus:

Let us define a set as **Normal** when it does *not* contain itself as a member (e.g., the set of all dogs), and as **Non-Normal** when it *does* contain itself as a member (i.e., it is recursive) (e.g., the set of all ideas). Now, let **N** represent the set of all **Normal** sets. We then ask, ""Is **N** itself a **Normal** set?""

If **N** is **Normal**, then **N** must contain itself, since **N** was defined as containing all **Normal** sets; however, if **N** contains itself, then it is by definition **Non-Normal**. ERROR: contradiction!

If N is **Non-Normal**, then by definition, it is a member of itself. However, if **N** is a member of itself, then it must be **Normal**, since **N** was defined as containing only **Normal** sets. ERROR: contradiction!

Once again, the problem is recursion (self-reference).

##In General Mathematics: 

Kurt Gödel's [Incompleteness Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) rocked the world of mathematical academia in 1931 by **proving**(!) that all efforts to establish a complete and consistent set of axioms to undergird our mathematics are *futile*!

Our mathematics can be either complete or consistent, but not both. We choose to say that it is consistent but not complete, which means that there exist statements that are true but not provable. An example is the ""Gödel Sentence"":

    This statement cannot be proved.

If this sentence cannot be proved, and is therefore true, then our system is incomplete. If it can be proved, then it proves a false statement, and our system is inconsistent.

For a third time, the problem is recursion (self-reference). If we ""know"" that our mathematical system is consistent and complete, it is by some means other than mathematical rigor!

Tellingly, theorems that are (assumed) true but unprovable have been called ""supernatural"" theorems^(1). Of course, we can never *know for sure* (i.e., prove) that a theorem is supernatural, but the most famous candidate is [Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture):

    Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

This statement will either be someday proved false or else forever remain a mere unproved candidate.

The very definition of the view cannot be induced via the ""inductive methods of the natural sciences"", and thus it contradicts itself! In addition, inductive methods are subject to error and are thus deductively fallacious.

**Virtuous Pagans of Greece.** The purpose of life is to know and apprehend the Good (as formulated, by instance, Plato).

**Evolutionary Biologists.** The purpose of life is that you have no purpose. Everything that you do is really because you've been programmed to be a good guardian of your genes and have a good probability of ensuring that your genes will copy themselves and flourish.

This is a big deal. Evolution says that one of the ultimate questions  is nonsense, namely, what is my purpose. I have no purpose because Evolution has no goal.

476,Junk DNA is Real and Doesn't Care if You Admit It.,6,True,"The idea that junk DNA doesn’t exist, and therefore represents a failed evolutionary prediction, is a common argument from creationists. The idea is that if creation is accurate, you’d expect everything to have a purpose, while evolutionary theory predicts that many features will not have a specific, selected function. (This contradicts other creationist claims, but that’s a different discussion.) Extending this idea to the genome, the idea is that under evolutionary theory, we’d expect that much of the DNA in the genome of any given organism is nonfunctional, while creation predicts functionality for the vast majority of bases in the a genome. 

 

Before we get into the arguments, we need to define a few things first.

Most importantly, junk DNA: Junk DNA is DNA that does not have a *selected function* and is not harmful. That is to say, it is DNA that is neither necessary nor detrimental; if you were to remove it from the genome, there would be no discernable effect on fitness. 

Second most important definition: Functional. Functional *does not* simply mean “does something.” There are many types of DNA that “do something” but are not functional. In this context, functional means having a selected function, i.e. if you removed it, there would be a fitness cost. Another way to say functional in this context is “contributes to cell physiology.”

 

So let’s get to it. I’m going to discuss this mostly in the context of the human genome, but I’ll bring other organisms into it where appropriate. I’ll try to be clear with regard to exactly what genome I’m talking about, but if I don’t specify, assume ours. 

 

So the evidence that junk DNA exists is crystal clear: Only about 2% of the human genome is actual protein-encoding genes. That **does not** mean that all of the rest is nonfunctional. There are a lot of functions associated with non-coding DNA. Regulatory regions like promoters, enhancers, and silencers are all non-coding but extremely important functionally. Structural regions like centromeres and telomeres are critical but non-coding. There are regions that must be a specific length, even though the sequence itself doesn’t matter. There are regions that are transcribed but not translated, such as DNA coding for ribosomal RNA, tRNAs, or micro-RNAs. These are not protein-encoding genes, but they are extremely important. All of these are examples of functional non-coding DNA. 

 

When you add all of these regions and classes together, coding regions and functional noncoding regions, you get about 10% of the human genome as functional. 

 

So what of the other 90%? If you’re going to argue that junk DNA isn’t real, you need to demonstrate that the vast majority of that remaining 90% is functional, i.e. has been selected to do something. So let’s dig into that 90% and see if we can find such functionality.

 

First, we need to acknowledge that some of that DNA is not “junk” because in addition to “not functional,” junk also implies “not harmful.” Some relatively small proportion of that 90% is going to be harmful in some way, so that’s out. I mention that briefly first because 1) it’s such a small % I don’t think it really matters for this discussion, and 2) I don’t think there’s any real disagreement on whether it exists. So that’s that. 

 

Other things that make up that 90%:

**Introns.** Noncoding regions found within genes. Excised after transcription. People have spent decades looking for a function. We still don’t have one. Introns are about 25% of the human genome. 

**Transposable elements.** These are sequences or regions that can or at some point could replicate and insert themselves somewhere else in a genome. Many are derived from retroviruses and called *endogenous retroviruses*, or ERVs, meaning retroviruses that inserted into our genome and then mutated and got stuck. ERVs alone are about 8% of the human genome. Additional transposable elements, such as SINEs, LINEs, and DNA transposons (as opposed to retrotransposons – ERVs, SINEs, LINEs), bring the total up to 44% or so, and none of it qualifies as functional.  

**Repeats**. These are just sequences that are, duh, repeats. The same thing over and over for some length in the DNA. There are many types of repeats, some very short and simple (e.g. tandem repeats and microsatellites) and some larger (e.g. segmental duplications). There is a lot of overlap between this category and transposable elements, since many of those include regions of repeats. There are also some regions that are functional that are composed of repeats. For example, some regulatory elements require a specific distance between them, independent of the sequence of that region. In some cases, those regions are comprised of repeats. Inclusively, repeats are over 50% of the human genome. If you remove transposable elements and length-dependent functional regions, it’s about 15%.

**Unique noncoding DNA**. This is the simplest category, it’s just non-repeat, non-transposon sequences that aren’t coding. In total, this is about 15% of the genome, but again, that includes some functional stuff, regulatory sequences and such. So remove those and you’re looking at 5-10% of the genome as *non-functional* unique sequences. 

**Pseudogenes**. These are sequences that were at some point active, protein-coding genes, but due to mutations to the regulatory mechanism or the gene sequence itself, are no longer functional. There are about 13,000 pseudogenes in the human genome. These would fall under the last category, unique noncoding DNA, but there are a lot of them so I wanted to mention them specifically. 

 

So that’s a rundown of the different types of non-functional DNA in the human genome.

 

If you are going to claim that junk DNA doesn’t exist, then you need to demonstrate that the vast majority of these elements are functional, i.e., have been selected to do something that contributes to cell physiology. 

 

You may have heard of the ENCODE project, which seeks to assign functions to most of the human genome. According to encode, 80-90% of the human genome is functional. However, they achieve this level of functionality by using an expansive definition of “functional” that sweeps in any DNA sequences that *does something*, even if that activity is not related to the physiology of the cell. For example, any transcribed sequence is functional according to ENCODE. That **includes** ERVs and pseudogenes. According to ENCODE, any sequence that binds to a protein is functional. But that ropes in pseudogenes with intact regulatory sequences. It includes transposons with intact protein binding sites.  These are examples of *activity*, not *function*, and only by conflating the two can ENCODE claim that 80-90% of the human genome is functional. 

 

But that’s not the whole argument. Oh, no, you think we’re done already? Get comfortable. 

 

Other organisms make the case against junk DNA even less tenable. I’m going to focus on two group – plants and protozoa – but there are other examples. 

 

Plants are extraordinarily tolerant of genome-scale changes. Polyploidy, genome duplication, they can handle it. As a result, you see extreme variation in genome size between closely related plant species. For example, the very tasty genus *Allium*, which contains onions, garlic, scallion, leak, and a ton of related species. The onion genome is about 17 *billion* base pairs, compared to about three billion for humans. Other members of *Allium* range from seven to 32 billion base pairs. If junk DNA doesn’t exist, that means an onion needs six times the information as a human, and closely related species (in the same genus) require twice as much again, while others are fine with less than half as much. At the other end of the spectrum, the raspberry genome contains fewer than 30 *million* base pairs. Is an onion plant really a thousand times more complex than a raspberry plant? 

Looking at these organisms, the idea that the vast majority of the genome is functional is not just unreasonable. It’s ludicrous. 

 

And you know what? Protozoa are even worse! Protozoa are unicellular eukaryotic organisms that are “animal-like” in their lifestyle i.e. they move around and eat things. Amoeba are protozoa, and one specific amoeba, *Amoeba dubia*, has the largest known genome: 670 billion base pairs. Over half a *trillion*. This is a unicellular organism! How on earth is an amoeba so much more complex than a plant or animal? I have no idea, but if you junk DNA doesn’t exist, most of those half trillion base pairs must be functional, so it must be. 

The problem here is that a common explanation is that the non-coding DNA is regulatory, particularly during development. So of course we don’t see functionality in adult cell cultures, those regions are only doing complex things during embryonic development, and that’s what the “other” 90% of the human genome is for. Okay, if that’s the case, why do plants and protozoa have such large genomes? Plants have much less complex developmental processes than mammals, and amoeba *are a single cell*. So what could all of that DNA possibly be doing in terms of regulating development? 

 

A much better explanation, consistent with the fact that those enormous genomes are mostly repeats, is that it is just junk.

 

So what’s the case for junk DNA? Most of the human genome doesn’t have a selected function. Closely related organisms exhibit enormous differences in genome size. The largest genomes are in unicellular eukaryotes. 

Put it all together and you have a strong case that junk DNA is real, and junk DNA is extremely common.

To demonstrate otherwise, you need to demonstrate functionality in the majority of the human genome. You need to show how functional differences explain the differences in genome size between closely related organisms like the members of *Allium*. You need to demonstrate functionality in the vast majority of the half trillion base pairs of those amoeba genomes. If you can’t do those things, you don’t have a case to make against junk DNA.

484,"The ""Argument From Incredulity"" and Evolutionary Dogma",0,True,"The claim of fallacy called the ""argument from incredulity"" is often employed as a defense against creationists' criticisms of the theory of evolution. The website [RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity), a favorite of subscribers to evolutionary dogma, also lists ""argument by lack of imagination"" as an alternate name.

Now, imagination is a necessary capability for pioneers in science, who must be able to see that which others are incapable of seeing. Who would have ""imagined"" that time can elapse at different rates ""at the same time"" under different circumstances? Who would have ""imagined"" that time can have a beginning, with no ""before""? Who would have ""imagined"" that life would be based on a complex code implemented in DNA and requiring complex biological nanomachines to replicate, transcribe and translate it?

But although imagination is a necessary capability of the scientist who is *formulating* hypotheses, it should not be expected of the scientist who is *evaluating* those hypotheses. Clear scientific evidence must be brought forth that fleshes out the formulator's imaginative ideas. For the examples cited above, actual experiments have been performed that confirm that time elapse is situation-dependent, time has a beginning, and DNA is the basis of all life—there is no appeal to imagination on the part of the critic.

The argument from incredulity is only fallacious when employed as a *deductive* argument; it is not (necessarily) fallacious as an *inductive* argument. The process of scientific advancement is almost, if not entirely, an exercise in induction. Induction is itself a fallacious deductive exercise (it is for this reason that science is always tentative). Let me expand on that statement:

---

**Deduction** is generally the process of making a specific claim, based on generalized premises. For example, one might start with the premises that ""All mammals are chordates"" and ""All horses are mammals"". From these, one can *deduce* that ""All horses are chordates"". Note that properly formulated deductions are **always** correct, if the premises are correct.

---

**Induction** is the process of making a generalized claim, based on a collection of specific data (hopefully covering a wide range of circumstances). For example, one might examine many mammals from a variety of locales, all of which happen to be horses, and inductively conclude that ""All mammals are horses"". Note that conclusions that are formulated by induction are **not** always correct, and thus are deductively fallacious.

---

When a critic of evolution cannot ""imagine"", for example, how (and why) a lizard with perfectly adequate claws that enable it to climb on any surface it finds in its environment, would ""evolve"" pads on its feet that employ an entirely novel phenomenon ([Van der Waals force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force)), overcoming all the concomitant design issues (cleaning of dust and loose debris, unsticking at will when desired, etc.), and create a smooth path of probable mutations that permit it to continuously improve its ability to survive the transition from claws to pads, it is not incumbent upon the critic to possess the requisite ""imagination"" to resolve these issues. Rather, it is the evolutionists that must be imaginative enough to propose verifiable solutions to these obstacles. **Unless these issues can be properly addressed and solutions offered, they remain as evidence against the hypothesis**.

Adherents to evolutionary dogma have **never** succeeded in applying their imaginative skills and offering a **testable**, **verifiable**, **falsifiable** explanation to **any** major supposed evolutionary transition (generation of a novel organelle, organ, body plan, biological system, biochemical process, or first life itself), much less the specific difficult ones such as the lizard => gecko transition offered above.

I'm basically just a guy (a Christian) with no particular professional background in either faith, or scientific studies. Although, I'm highly interested in each field. I am a practicing Christian, but I would probably classify my self as a typical ""Christmas and easter"" Christian. I believe in God and try to live by the teaching of the Bible, but there are oviously people who know it better than me. 

Likewise, science, is a bit of a hobby for me. I'm fascinated by scientific discoveries, theories, and principles. I love reading about the scientific process, and am always reading journals and learning about new discoveries. 

I've always reconciled the two by believing that my religion has been here to teach me about how I should live my life, and treat other people. Everyone and everything was created by God and deserves to be resected as such. I have always believed that science has been a field that explores and learns everything possible about the universe god has created for us to live in. In my mind, nothing demonstrates gods awesome power more than the vast universe that expands beyond sight, created 13 odd billion years ago by a big bang (i.e. ""let there be light""). We can't understand how most things in the universe work, and we may never be able to explain why everything happens. 

Maybe I have just lived under a rock for too long, but on my own, it never crossed my mind that God and general scientific knowledge must exist independent of each other. But the more I find myself in the world, the more people I see that believe in either science, or religion (definitely not both) I just wonder why this is. Why can't god exist with everything we've discovered about the universe? Likewise, why would any of our scientific discoveries disprove the existence of god?

I hope you don't think I'm shitposting. This question has nagged at me for a very long time, and I just wonder why this debate exists to begin with.

490,ID and Evolution,0,True,"Since my last post didn't go over so well I will try again, but be more upfront with my beliefs.

I believe in Intelligent Design. I believe a supernatural being created the earth and very basic lifeforms on it. Then started the process of evolution causing these basic lifeforms to evolve into the millions and millions of different species of plants and animals that we have today. However, when mankind reached its latest (and in my opinion, last) stage of development, the creator for the most part, shut down the evolutionary process.

This is evident as we have a rich fossil history proving evolution, but we have nothing showing large scale speciation in the last 200,000 years. Why has evolution basically slowed down since then? Why isn't there a long list of species that have emerged in this time? If you look at the vast majority of species of vertebrates, you can see their species emerged a long, long time ago, hundreds of thousands of years. No one can provide me a sizable list of new-ish vertebrate species. Everyone always falls back to plants and insects. They get angry, they call me names, they say its not far for me to exclude plants and insects.  Well, sorry, but within my belief system it absolutely is fair to exclude them.

So heres the challenge, I will admit I am 100% wrong and there is no God if anyone can come up with a list of 15 non-plant, non-insect species of animals that have emerged in the last 100-200k years. I will only count **good examples** and I promise not to quibble and exclude any that meet my criteria: 

* Non-plant
* Non-insect
* Is fully speciated, no examples of animals that have started the process, but are not considered a new species
* Subspecies do not count! Wolves and Domesticated dogs are still C. Lupus, they are still the same **species**
* If you can provide the classification names, I have no way to complain about the example

493,Circular reasoning in evolution? (x-post /r/Creation),1,True,"There’s a wonderful volume titled “Galileo goes to Jail and other Myths about Science and Religion” published by Harvard University Press, and one of the ""myths"" is “That the theory of organic evolution is based on circular reasoning”, authored by Nicolaas Rupke.

Rupke himself is an interesting person: he is currently a historian of science, but initially trained as a geologist and was also a Young-Earth Creationist in his younger years. Alas, he lost his faith when he entered Princeton University’s doctoral program in geology. His essay deals with both the geological column and homology, but this post concentrates on the latter.

Here’s a section from Rupke’s essay:

“In Icons of Evolution (2000), [Jonathan] Wells discusses “why
much of what we teach about evolution is wrong.” One of the
“icons” he cites, conventionally used as proof of evolution, is
the phenomenon of homology. “But what precisely is homology?”
Wells asks. Under the heading “Homology and circular
reasoning,” he explains that evolutionary biologists define the
term as the similarity between different species that is due to
their shared ancestry. In other words, homology indicates evolution
and evolution produces homology — a perfect “circular
argument.

“*Consider the example of bone patterns in forelimbs, which Darwin
regarded as evidence for the common ancestry of the vertebrates.
A neo-Darwinist who wants to determine whether vertebrate
forelimbs are homologous must first determine whether they [the
species being compared] are derived from a common ancestor. In
other words, there must be evidence for common ancestry before
limbs can be called homologous. But then to turn around and argue
that homologous limbs point to common ancestry is a vicious circle:
Common ancestry demonstrates homology which demonstrates
common ancestry.*”

It becomes no easier for the Darwinists—Wells maintains—
when they turn to the fossil record to help determine evolutionary
relationships. *“Unfortunately, comparing fossils is no more
straightforward than comparing live specimens... Any attempt
to infer evolutionary relationships among fossils based on
homology- as- common- ancestry ‘soon leads to a tangle of circular
arguments from which there is no escape.’ ”*

Some evolutionists have talked back in an effort to absolve
themselves from the sins of chasing their tails. But this has
proved no easy matter. Creation scientists aren’t fools and,
**strictly speaking, do have logic on their side in the major cases
cited here.** Moreover, they have been able to amass quotations
from concerned evolutionists who apprehensively admit to the
illogical practices of which they stand accused. Quite likely,
a variety of paleontologico- stratigraphical studies are unreliable
because they are founded on a petitio principii (the logical fallacy
of “begging the question”).

All the same, the assertion that evolution is crucially based on
circular arguments is a myth.""

(citations removed, my bolding)

Rupke goes on to discuss how the term “homology” was originally coined by Richard Owen, an English anatomist, in his book “On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton”. For Owen, a homologue was defined as “The same organ in different animals
under every variety of form and function.”, which Owen, as an old-earth creationist, interpreted as evidence of a repeated divine design. Rupke also notes that Owen later began to become more open to a theistic evolutionary view point.

Rupke also discusses how Darwin himself took these observations about vertebrate skeletons, and argued that they were characteristics derived from a common ancestor. Darwin argued in the 14th chapter of the Origin of Species that, for example, because there is no functional reason for the pentadactyl limb to be shared by humans moles, horses, porpoises, bats, therefore it was better explained by descent with modification. 

My comment: I think Rupke is correct insofar as, even if you have some disagreements with it, you can follow the structure of Darwin’s argument concerning vertebrate skeletons, and the argument itself certainly isn't circular.

However, I think the problem lies in that we have examples of biologists using both definitions of the term “homology”, creating a circular argument.

Jonathan Wells remains correct in calling this out.

However, he conceded that the ""maximum we can go"" from an Islamic theological perspective is to say that God inserted Adam in the natural order.

From his perspective, believers would see this last domino as a miracle of God, whereas non-believers would see a causal connection from all the other dominos.

496,Theory neutrality and consistency about facts.,0,True,"There is a strictly defined set of criteria that a recovery from disease, of a sufferer, immediately consequent to a pilgrimage to Lourdes, must meet, in order for that recovery to be classed as a miracle. Occasionally these criteria are met and a miracle is accepted to have occurred. So, by definition and observation, miracles occur. 

Similarly, we can point to occurrences of evolution and of speciation. These are things that occur as a matter of definition and observation. 

It doesn't follow from the occurrence of miracles that there is a god or that there are supernatural occurrences, all that has been established is that miracles occur. Neither does it follow from the occurrence of evolution or speciation that there are no gods or that there are no supernatural occurrences, all that has been established is that evolution and speciation occur. 

So, as all these occurrences: evolution, miracles and speciation, are theory neutral, is there any way in which an epistemic agent can accept the occurrence of some but not all of these occurrences, and still be intellectually consistent?

498,How Sex Evolves,14,True,"The evolution of sexual reproduction is a perpetual sticking point for creationists. Commonly framed as along the lines of, “how did the first female reproduce without any males?” or “sex couldn’t have evolved because it would requires males and females to appear at the same time,” these objections completely miss the robust understanding we have of the evolution of sexual reproduction.

 

Before we get to the how, let’s cover the why. So why have sex? Jokes aside, there are a lot of downsides – high energetic cost, high search cost (have to find a mate), can be dangerous, more susceptible to disease, sexual selection lead to detrimental traits, there are a **lot** of reasons why sex would be selected against. But it allows for greater genetic variation within a population. It does this through allowing for recombination between individuals, which allows for different allele combinations to appear more rapidly than in asexual populations. So you can combine beneficial alleles, or decouple a beneficial allele from a detrimental one, much more rapidly than in the absence of sexual reproduction.

 

This is primarily beneifical under two sets of conditions. First, when the environment changes rapidly or conditions are unfavorable, there is an enormous advantage to being about the shuffle the deck and try to generate a new genotype, which might be better suited to the present conditions. We see this is paramecium, which can reproduce sexually and asexually, and tend to do the former in hostile environments. 

 

Second, sexual reproduction is beneficial in the context of complex interactions between different organisms, especially antagonistic relationships, such as that between a host and parasite. Both organisms are constantly imposing selective pressures on and adapting to the other, and the flexibility conferred by sexual recombination allows for the maintenance of a stable relationship, rather than one participant “winning” and the other “losing.” This is often described as the [Red Queen hypothesis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) named for the scene in “Through the Looking Glass.”

 

So that’s the why. Now how does that happen? It starts with a simple truth: Under many conditions, recombination confers a fitness advantage. In more ancestral organisms, bacteria and archaea, this can be accomplished by taking up exogenous DNA and incorporating into your own genome – the process of *transformation*. Some types of bacteria can do this directly, particularly when certain plasmids are present, via the process of *conjugation*. More broadly, we can group these processes together under the umbrella of *horizontal gene transfer*, the movement of genetic material between individuals in a population or in different populations.

 

Since they’re more complex, eukaryotes have a number of different way of accomplishing the same thing. Some unicellular organisms can just fuse, recombine, and divide under adverse conditions. Some filamentous green algae, like [spirogyra,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Spirogyra.JPG/1280px-Spirogyra.JPG) can line up in parallel, and adjacent cells can fuse. They then divide to return to a haploid state, swapping alleles along the way. 

 

Some species have developed *mating types*, which are distinct forms that cannot mate with each other. For example, [chlamydamonas](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/studies/invertebrates/invertimages/chlamy.gif) has mt(+) and mt(-) types, and they can only mate with each other, but two mt(+) types cannot mate. Why should this happen? Well recombination is most effective when it’s between two very different individuals. If two very similar individuals mate, the likelihood of generating novel combinations of alleles is quite low. Having mating types promotes the mixing between more different individuals, and should therefore be selected for. In this example, we don’t yet have male and female, since the cells that fuse, the *gametes*, are not different between the two types.

 

In this situation, different strategies can emerge – put very little energy into many offspring, or put a lot of energy into very few. Selection can favor one or the other in the different mating types, leading to a divergence in gamete morphology. Individuals that make many, but put little E into each are males, individuals that make few with a high E investment are females. That’s the distinction between simple mating types and true sexes – differentiated gametes. 

 

At this point, true sexual reproduction exists, but we’ve only discussed unicellular organisms. It’s not too different in multicellularity, except that with more complexity, you can have selection acting on different aspects of the process, biased operational sex ratios, the ratio of breeding males to breeding females at any given time, can lead to things like sexual selection and sexual dimorphism.

 

I’ll just finish up with a quick look at two organisms that demonstrate these dynamics: Paramecium and bdelloid rotifers. [Paramecia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Paramecium.jpg/610px-Paramecium.jpg) are unicellular ciliates and can reproduce asexually via [binary fission](http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca/ftp/biodidac/protista/ciliopho/photo/olih023p.gif) or sexually via [conjugation](http://bio1903.nicerweb.com/Locked/media/ch28/28_11bParamecReprod_2-L.jpg) (a very complicated process, not the same conjugation as described above). Generally, they are asexual, but when food is scarce or conditions hostile, they will conjugate. 

 

The [bdelloid rotifers](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/micropolitan/fresh/rotifer/philodina.jpg) are extremely interesting because they appear to be a rare example of a very ancient asexual lineage of animals. Rather than sexual reproduction, they have other mechanisms for fighting parasites and generating novel allelic combinations. They can dry out, killing any parasites, then rehydrate and go on their way. They also have weird genomes described as “degenerate tetraploid,” that is, they have four copies of their genome, but no one copy is complete. Instead, they have two incomplete sets of two copies each, and there can be intra-genomic recombination and gene conversion to increase diversity. In other words, they’ve evolved other mechanisms to accomplish the same things that sexual reproduction does in most organisms. 

 

So that’s a quick look at the evolution of sexual reproduction. There’s a lot more to talk about here (I didn’t even mention genome duplication!), but this is a good introduction and should help dispel some of the misunderstandings surrounding how sex could have appeared in the first place.",1470074959,4,2016-08-01 14:09:19

Dr. Mary Schweitzer reported^(1) that her tests indicate that dinosaur bone cell DNA is present in her fossil samples. Dr. Schweitzer's work utilized markers that would detect certain DNA sequences, and the DNA fragments had to be at least dozens of base-pairs long in order to indicate DNA presence. But in the same year, 2012, [another study](http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555)^(2) determined that the half-life (the time it takes for half of the bonds in the DNA to spontaneously break down) is 521 years at 13.1°C. The breakdown is due to many factors, the most significant of which is hydrolysis due to the ""almost ubiquitous"" presence of groundwater. But 52 million years would be 100-thousand half-lives! To put this in perspective, even if there were as many base-pairs as there are particles in the universe, they would all break down in only 300 half-lives!

Also in 2012, another study^(3) stated:

> However, even under the best preservation conditions at –5°C, our model predicts that **no intact bonds** (average length = 1 bp [base pair]) will remain in the DNA ‘strand’ after 6.8 Myr. This displays the extreme improbability of being able to amplify a 174 bp DNA fragment from an 80–85 Myr old Cretaceous bone. [my emphasis]

Number 3: Creationists and Junk DNA

Lately there has been quite a surge of people debating the amount of functionality of DNA.

[Example of long discussion, not even a day old.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4uhgxu/failed_evolutionist_predictions/d5ram9w)

How much of our DNA is junk DNA? Is ""junk"" DNA an old term? How much of our DNA is ""functional"", and how do we even define functionality. What did ENCODE find out?

Those are all interesting questions, however, this post is **not** going to be about those topics, mainly because I want to highlight the reason why creationists seem to be absolutely fascinated by the findings of ENCODE and why creationists will always fight by the teeth to defend any notion that would imply that all of our DNA is functional.

 

The reason is really simple: If our DNA is fully functional, it would be an advantageous talking point for creationists because it shows the ""perfection"" of nature and our genetic information. If there is non-functional DNA in our bodies, that would be an ""imperfection"".

That is the only shallow reason why you'll always find a bigger amount of creationists wanting to prove that our DNA has a lot of unforeseen function compared to the relative amount of biologists etc. Yes, it's that obvious.

 

However, nature is imperfect and evolution leaves it's prints in our DNA. Endogenous retroviruses leave prints in our DNA and thus are likely non-functional. A lot of other animals have extremely varying amounts of DNA even if not being of the same complexity, pointing towards a lot of DNA not being functional in any way.

But regardless, to make my post similar to my previous ones, here are some points to consider:


2. No, it is not an unexpected or recent discovery that a pretty big portion of our DNA has biochemical activity. Also, it has long been known that some noncoding DNA has important functions. (This was known even before the phrase ""junk DNA"" was coined.)

1. No, 100% of our DNA being functional does not validate creationism anyway. You can argue your whole life and hope that we find out that even more of our DNA is functional, but that will never be an actual problem for biologists.


I find it absolutely strange that so many creationists will chime in with arguments like:

""Scientists were wrong about junk DNA.""

""ENCODE found out that 80% of our DNA has biochemical functions.""

And I just fail to understand what they want to prove with that? Why is it always creationists bringing up ENCOD as if that somehow was a counter argument to evolution??

 

Does it even shine trough to creationists that most wouldn't care even if we found out that 100% of our DNA is functional? Which, by the way, is very very likely never going to be true. There is [good evidence](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html) that much DNA has no function:


- Sections of DNA can be cut out or replaced with randomized sequences with no apparent effect on the organism (Nóbrega et al. 2004).

- Some sections of DNA are corrupted copies of functional coding DNA, but mutations in them, such as stop codons early in the sequence, show that they cannot have retained the same function as the coding copy.

- The fugu fish has a genome that is about one third as large as its close relatives.

- Mutations in functional regions of DNA show evidence of selection -- nonsilent changes occur less often that one would expect by chance. In other sections of DNA, there is no evidence that any changes are selected against.

406,The argument of a intelligent designer required to setup the Metabolic Networks for the origin of life.,0,True,"The argument of a intelligent designer required to setup the Metabolic Networks for the origin of life. 

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2371-how-cellular-enzymatic-and-metabolic-networks-point-to-design

Observation: The existence of metabolic pathways is crucial for molecular and cellular function.  Although bacterial genomes differ vastly in their sizes and gene repertoires, no matter how small, they must contain all the information to allow the cell to perform many essential (housekeeping) functions that give the cell the ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis, reproduce, and evolve, the three main properties of living cells. Gil et al. (2004)  In fact, metabolism is one of the most conserved cellular processes. By integrating data from comparative genomics and large-scale deletion studies, the paper ""Structural analyses of a hypothetical minimal metabolism""   proposes a minimal gene set comprising 206 protein-coding genes for a hypothetical minimal cell. The paper lists 50 enzymes/proteins required to create a metabolic network implemented by a hypothetical minimal genome for the hypothetical minimal cell. The  50 enzymes/proteins , and the metabolic network, must be fully implemented to permit a cell to keep its basic functions.  
Hypothesis (Prediction): The origin of biological irreducible metabolic pathways which also require regulation and and which are structured like a cascade, similar to electronic circuit boards,  are best explained by the creative action of an intelligent agent.
Experiment: Experimental investigations of metabolic networks  indicate that they are  full of nodes with enzymes/proteins, that require for their synthesis information rich, language-based codes stored in DNA . Hierarchical structures have been proved to be best suited for capturing most of the features of metabolic networks (Ravasz et al, 2002). It has been found that metabolites can only be synthesized if carbon, nitrogen, phosphor, and sulfur and the basic building blocks generated from them in central metabolism are available. This implies that regulatory networks gear metabolic activities to the availability of these basic resources.  So one metabolic circuit depends on the product of other products, coming from other, central metabolic pathways, one depending from the other, like in a casacade.  Further noteworthy is that Feedback loops have been found to be required to regulate metabolic flux, and the activities of many or all of the enzymes in a pathway.  In many cases, metabolic pathways are highly branched, in which case it is often necessary to alter fluxes through part of the network while leaving them unaltered or decreasing them in other parts of the network (Curien et al., 2009). These are interconnected in a functional way, resulting in a living cell. The biological metabolic networks  are  exquisitely integrated, so the significant alterations in  inevitably damage or destroys the funcion. Changes in flux often require changes in the activities of multiple enzymes in a metabolic sequence. Synthesis of one metabolite typically requires the operation of many pathways.
Conclusion:   Regardless of its initial complexity, self-maintaining chemical-based metabolic life could not have emerged in the absence of a genetic replicating mechanism insuring the maintenance, stability, and diversification of its components. In the absence of any hereditary mechanisms, autotrophic reaction chains would have come and gone without leaving any direct descendants able to resurrect the process. Life as we know it consists of both chemistry and information.   If metabolic life ever did exist on the early Earth, to convert it to life as we know it would have required the emergence of some type of information system under conditions that are favorable for the survival and maintenance of genetic informational molecules. ( Ribas de Poupkna, Ph.D.)
    Intelligent agents have frequently end goals in mind, and use high levels of instructional complex information to met the goal. In our experience, systems storing large amounts of specified/instructional complex information through  codes and languages -- invariably originate from an intelligent source.  Likewise, circuits or networks of coordinated interaction as for example  of analog electronic devices can always be traced back to a intelligent causal agent. The operation of analog electronic devices maps very closely to the flow of information in chemical reactions of metabolic pathways (McAdams and Shapiro, 1995). A proposed mechanism to make metabolical networks  must be capable of construct de novo, not merely modifying, a minimal set of 50  enzymes, and complex integrated metabolic circuits with the end goal  to create life. A metabolic network that is not fully operational, will not permit life.  We know in our experience that intelligence is able to setup  circuit  boards, like discrete electronic boards, and is the  only known cause of irreducibly complex machines. Since evolution depends on metabolic circuits fully setup,  its excluded as possible mechanism. The only two alternatives, chance/luck or physical necessity have never been observed to be able to setup circuit boards and irreducible complex systems.  The origin of the basic metabolical network of the first cells is therefore best explained through the action of a intelligent agency.

410,"Medicine validates evolutionary mechanisms, Part 2: Gaining, losing, and predicting antibiotic resistance",13,True,"Today we’re talking about antibiotic resistance, and how it’s appearance, loss (or retention), and predictions of antibiotic genotypes validate evolutionary theory. I want to make very clear: If evolutionary theory was incorrect, we would not observe these processes as we do, and we would not be able to make accurate predictions about them. 

 

So the process for acquiring antibiotic resistance is pretty simple. You have a population of bacteria that harbors a fair amount of genetic diversity. Through more-or-less random mutations (and some other processes, but we’ll stick with mutations today), some members of that population gain antibiotic resistance, which I’ll abbreviate “AR” from here. 

 

Most of the time, AR carries a cost. This is called **antagonist pleiotropy**, meaning a single mutation has multiple effects, some good (AR), and some bad (e.g. grow more slowly). So most of the time, in the absence of antibiotics, the cells with AR are selected against, and consequently any one AR mutation is not maintained in the population. However, because there are often many ways to achieve AR, there are often some AR individuals present in the population. 

 

Once antibiotics are present, the dynamics change. AR provides a clear fitness advantage, and over time, only AR individuals will remain. This is where it gets interesting. Since in the absence of antibiotics, AR is a net negative, we’d expect mutations that cause the *loss* of AR to occur, and for non-AR individuals to take over again. But this is rarely observed. How?

 

Well, the AR individuals don’t stop evolving after one mutation. They continue to experience mutations, and some of them are beneficial *when they occur with an AR mutation*. These mutations are called **compensatory mutations**, because they, you guessed it, compensate for the deleterious effects of the AR mutation. To illustrate this with arbitrary numbers, when there are no antibiotics present, the original individuals might have a fitness of 10 (arbitrary units), AR individuals a fitness of 5, and AR+compensatory (abbreviated AR+C going forward) individuals a fitness of 8 or 9, or even 10. 

 

Since the AR population continues mutating and evolving, they often find these compensatory mutations, and these second mutations prevent the loss of AR even once the drugs are removed. Why? There is no pathway back to a non-resistant genotype favored by selection. AR+C can lose either the AR or C mutations (this is called *reversion*, when a mutation reverts back to the ancestral state), but that intermediate is worse than AR+C, whether the antibiotics are present or not. That means those individuals would be selected against, making it unlikely that enough of them stick around long enough to find the second reversion to restore the non-resistant genotype. And that’s assuming just two mutations in the pathway. AR often involves more than that. There’s a name for this well-documented mechanism: The lobster trap model of antibiotic resistance, and it’s the reason that once AR appears, it’s almost never lost. 

 

But it’s not all bad. We can use our knowledge of these dynamics to predict what genotypes we expect to see when a bacteria is introduced to a new antibiotic. There have been several experiments in which bacteria were exposed to and allowed to evolve resistance to a specific drug. The mutations present in the resistant bacteria were determined, and then each was evaluated for it’s fitness effects, alone and in combination with each of the others. In one of these experiments, there were five mutations required for the strongest resistance phenotype, but of the 120 possible pathways from 0 to 5 mutations, only a few resulted in an increase in the degree of AR at each step, meaning those are the genotypes we’d expect to see as the bacteria gains resistance. 

 

This can allow us to predict what genotypes we expect to see when a new drug is introduced clinically, and we’ve actually done so successfully. This kind of work led to the discovery of two previously unknown resistance mutations to a drug called cefepime. Within three years, one of those mutations was clinically isolated, just as was expected. We were able to make that prediction based on the experimentally determined fitness associated with each AR mutation. 

 

So to wrap this up, none of this would work if evolutionary mechanisms as we understand them were not operating. AR wouldn’t spread, it wouldn’t be maintained even after treatment, and we wouldn’t be able to predict what resistance mutations will appear after a drug is introduced. But all of those things do happen. 

So my questions are twofold. First, does anyone dispute the basic mechanisms at work here? Second, if evolutionary mechanisms *aren’t* driving these processes, what is, and what evidence do you have for this alternative? ",1468706963,0,2016-07-16 18:09:23

Problem no.1
The genetic code system ( language ) must be created, and the universal code is nearly optimal and maximally efficient

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8335231
The genetic language is a collection of rules and regularities of genetic information coding for genetic texts. It is defined by alphabet, grammar, collection of punctuation marks and regulatory sites, semantics.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293468/
In our opinion, despite extensive and, in many cases, elaborate attempts to model code optimization, ingenious theorizing along the lines of the coevolution theory, and considerable experimentation, very little definitive progress has been made.
Summarizing the state of the art in the study of the code evolution, we cannot escape considerable skepticism. It seems that the two-pronged fundamental question: “why is the genetic code the way it is and how did it come to be?”, that was asked over 50 years ago, at the dawn of molecular biology, might remain pertinent even in another 50 years. Our consolation is that we cannot think of a more fundamental problem in biology.

The genetic code is one in a million 
if we employ weightings to allow for biases in translation, then only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the natural code. We thus conclude not only that the natural genetic code is extremely efficient at minimizing the effects of errors, but also that its structure reflects biases in these errors, as might be expected were the code the product of selection.

Determination of the Core of a Minimal Bacterial Gene Set Based on the conjoint analysis of several computational and experimental strategies designed to define the minimal set of protein-coding genes that are necessary to maintain a functional bacterial cell, we propose a minimal gene set composed of 206 genes ( which code for 13 protein complexes ) Such a gene set will be able to sustain the main vital functions of a hypothetical simplest bacterial cell with the following features. 
These protein complexes could not emerge through evolution ( muations and natural selection ) , because evolution depends on the dna replication, which requires precisely these original genes and proteins ( chicken and egg prolem ). So the only mechanism left is chance, and physical necessity.

Genomic DNA is already used on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity, but stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological timescales; in fact, it is the most durable construct known. Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally cannot be ruled out.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832087/?report=classic
DNA sequences that code for proteins need to convey, in addition to the protein-coding information, several different signals at the same time. These “parallel codes” include binding sequences for regulatory and structural proteins, signals for splicing, and RNA secondary structure. Here, we show that the universal genetic code can efficiently carry arbitrary parallel codes much better than the vast majority of other possible genetic codes. This property is related to the identity of the stop codons. We find that the ability to support parallel codes is strongly tied to another useful property of the genetic code—minimization of the effects of frame-shift translation errors. Whereas many of the known regulatory codes reside in nontranslated regions of the genome, the present findings suggest that protein-coding regions can readily carry abundant additional information.

Problem no.3
The genetic cipher
The British biologist John Maynard Smith has described the origin of the code as the most perplexing problem in evolutionary biology. With collaborator Eörs Szathmáry he writes: “The existing translational machinery is at the same time so complex, so universal, and so essential that it is hard to see how it could have come into existence, or how life could have existed without it.” To get some idea of why the code is such an enigma, consider whether there is anything special about the numbers involved. Why does life use twenty amino acids and four nucleotide bases? It would be far simpler to employ, say, sixteen amino acids and package the four bases into doublets rather than triplets. Easier still would be to have just two bases and use a binary code, like a computer. If a simpler system had evolved, it is hard to see how the more complicated triplet code would ever take over. The answer could be a case of “It was a good idea at the time.” A good idea of whom ?  If the code evolved at a very early stage in the history of life, perhaps even during its prebiotic phase, the numbers four and twenty may have been the best way to go for chemical reasons relevant at that stage. Life simply got stuck with these numbers thereafter, their original purpose lost. Or perhaps the use of four and twenty is the optimum way to do it. There is an advantage in life’s employing many varieties of amino acid, because they can be strung together in more ways to offer a wider selection of proteins. But there is also a price: with increasing numbers of amino acids, the risk of translation errors grows. With too many amino acids around, there would be a greater likelihood that the wrong one would be hooked onto the protein chain. So maybe twenty is a good compromise. Do random chemical reactions have knowledge to arrive at a optimal conclusion, or a "" good compromise"" ?  

An even tougher problem concerns the coding assignments—i.e., which triplets code for which amino acids. How did these designations come about? Because nucleic-acid bases and amino acids don’t recognize each other directly, but have to deal via chemical intermediaries, there is no obvious reason why particular triplets should go with particular amino acids. Other translations are conceivable. Coded instructions are a good idea, but the actual code seems to be pretty arbitrary. Perhaps it is simply a frozen accident, a random choice that just locked itself in, with no deeper significance. 

That frozen accident means, that good old luck would have  hit the jackpot  trough trial and error amongst 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes . That is the number of atoms in the whole universe. That puts any real possibility of chance providing the feat out of question. Its , using  Borel's law, in the realm of impossibility.  The maximum time available for it to originate was estimated at 6.3 x 10^15 seconds. Natural selection would have to evaluate roughly 10^55 codes per second to find the one that's universal. Put simply, natural selection lacks the time necessary to find the universal genetic code. 

Put it in other words : The task compares to invent two languages, two alphabets, and a translation system, and the information content of a book ( for example hamlet)  being written in english translated  to chinese  in a extremely sophisticared hardware system. The conclusion that a intelligent designer had to setup the system follows not based on missing knowledge ( argument from ignorance ). We know that minds do invent languages, codes, translation systems, ciphers, and complex, specified information all the time.  The genetic code and its translation system is best explained through the action of a intelligent designer.

412,Medicine validates evolutionary mechanisms: Vaccines wouldn’t work if evolutionary theory was invalid.,11,True,"We don’t need to look at the past or even experimental evidence to see that evolutionary theory is valid. We can simply look at efforts to prevent disease, and processes that occur as the result of medical treatments, vaccines specifically. 

 

I’m going to discuss “live attenuated” vaccines. These are vaccines composed of live viruses that are “attenuated,” mutated or deficient in some way, and so unable to cause a clinical infection (i.e. unable to make you sick). 

 

If evolutionary theory was invalid, we wouldn’t be able to make and then use live attenuated vaccines, because the process takes advantage of naturally occurring mutations and selection for variants that are *worse* at infecting humans. How does that work?

 

First, the virus in question has to be isolated. Then it is grown for many generations in non-human cell cultures in a process called passaging. For example, the Sabin polio vaccine (one of several, but the important one in the 20th century, which is now being phased out) is a live attenuated vaccine composed of polio viruses grown on monkey kidney cells. During this time, mutations appear. Normally, when the virus is infecting humans, most of the mutations will be detrimental. But some of them are adaptive (i.e. beneficial) when infecting monkey cells, and selection acting on the population of viruses growing in those cells favors the new variants. 

 

An important point here is that evolution often involves trade-offs. It’s rare for one virus, for example, to be equally good at infecting multiple hosts, compared to viruses specific to each host. Going back to polio, the mutations that help the viruses infect monkey cells make them worse at infecting humans. So after a sufficient number of passages (the number varies based on the specific type of vaccine), the now attenuated viruses can be purified and used as the basis for a vaccine. When a person is given the vaccine, those viruses try to infect their cells, but they are not as good at doing so compared to “normal” polio (or influenza, or whatever pathogen you’re dealing with), so the immune system has plenty of time to recognize the invaders and mount a robust defense. Now, if that person is exposed to wild-type (non-attenuated) polio, they will have the antibodies and cells ready to defeat it before it can make them sick.

 

This process, the production and use of live attenuated vaccines, relies on the processes of mutation and selection to generate a strain of virus that has adapted to an alternate host. Importantly, that host must be similar enough to humans that the virus can still infect human cells after passaging, but different enough that selection for the alternate host imposes a fitness cost when the new strain infects humans. If evolutionary theory was invalid, this process would not work. Therefore, two centuries of vaccination validate evolutionary theory. 

 

But that’s not the end. We need a new flu vaccine every year, and if evolutionary theory was invalid, that wouldn’t be the case. Why do we need a new flu vaccine every year? Why can’t we just figure out one that will last? Stupid scientists. 

 

We need a new flu vaccine (actually three) every year because of *strain replacement*. The whole point of the flu vaccine is to target the most common strains in a given year, to prevent them from circulating at a high rate. So for example, say you have four strains: A, B, C, and D. The vaccine targets A, B, and C, which combine for about 90% of the influenza population (I’m making numbers up to simplify how it works, but that’s the gist – you target the common strains). At the beginning of the flu season, it’s A/B/C at 90%, D at 10%. But the vaccine is effective, and enough people get it that it generally works, so by the end of the flu season, D is up to 80% of all cases. 

 

That happens because of evolutionary mechanisms. The vaccine imposes a selective pressure against strains A/B/C, so D (and other, novel variants) increases in frequency while the others decrease. And next year, that vaccine is ineffective not because it wouldn’t work anymore, but because its targets have been selected out of the population. It’s one of the ironies of flu vaccination: The more effective the vaccine and successful the vaccination campaign are in a given year, the less effective that vaccine will be the next year. Thanks, evolution.

 

 So for these reasons, vaccination does not just *support* evolutionary theory, but *validates* it, as in, if evolutionary theory was invalid, these things would not be the case. Attenuated vaccines would not work. We would not need a new flu vaccine every year. Therefore, evolutionary theory is valid.

 

Note: I was originally going to discuss antibiotic resistance as well, but this is long enough, so I’ll do that next week, most likely.",1467939525,56,2016-07-07 20:58:45
413,Generating Novel Genetic Information via Gene Duplication,7,True,"One of the most common objections to evolutionary theory is that there is no mechanism through which new genetic information can be generated through mutation and selection. The idea is that mutations tend to be deleterious (detrimental), and that you can’t change a gene too much or you lose its functionality, even if it does something else. So the chances of finding a new function while preserving the old are too small for evolutionary mechanisms to generate novel genetic information (i.e. new functions). 

 

This is completely wrong. We know how genetic information can increase. I’m going to discuss one general mechanism and describe a couple of examples, but there are other mechanisms and processes we could also discuss. Basically, claiming that you can’t generate new genetic information is indicative of either unfamiliarity with basic genetics and evolutionary biology, or straight up dishonesty. 

 

The basic mechanism I’m going to discuss is gene duplication followed by divergence, selection, and specialization. 

 

Gene duplication is an extremely common phenomenon. We see evidence of it in every genome, from prokaryotes to mammals. There are several mechanisms, but most involve some kind of unequal crossing over or recombination. During recombination, two pieces of matching DNA line up and swap equal parts, which leads to new combinations of alleles. This is one of the primary reasons why sexual reproduction is favored in many organisms, especially under adverse conditions (origins of sex: another fun topic). 

 

Recombination doesn’t always work perfectly. Since there are only so many combinations of nucleotides, and most genomes contain similar or repeated regions, unequal crossing over is fairly frequent. This occurs when the two DNA molecules don’t line up correctly; one is offset along the other. [This leads to the gain of DNA on one side and the loss on the other.](http://web.pdx.edu/~newmanl/UnequalXover.gif) Now, that loss is usually problematic for the cell that get’s that chromosome, but the gain may or may not cause a problem. 

 

If the gain doesn’t cause a problem, the cell[s] with that chromosome now have an extra copy of any genes in the duplicated region. This what allows for a new function to evolve

 

One copy of the gene in question is constrained; it must maintain its original function in order for the organism to survive. The other copy is not constrained; it experiences relaxed selection. Mutations can occur without impacting the fitness of the organism. Often, those mutations will inactivate the gene and it will become a pseudogene. But they may also lead to a slight change in the protein structure, allowing it to bind or act on a different substrate, or participate in a different pathway, for example. 

 

These changes may be deleterious, beneficial, or neutral. If they’re beneficial, selection will favor the organisms with them, and over time, the population will have a higher proportion of individuals with that new function. In other words, new genetic information will have appeared within a population. The very thing that creationists say can’t happen. 

 

There are lots of examples of gene families that originated this way, but I’m going to briefly describe two, one somewhat small scale, one extremely large scale. 

 

On the smaller scale, we have the globin family of proteins in animals. These are proteins involved in oxygen transport – hemoglobin and myoglobin. Based on the sequence similarity between the genes of this family (myoglobin, alpha hemoglobin, beta hemoglobin), we can trace them backwards to a single gene that is the common ancestor of all three (actually more, but three main ones). So these are homologous genes – genes that share a common ancestor. [Myoglobin was the first to diverge, then the two types of hemoglobin diverged from each other more recently.](http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Globin_gene_evolution_2.gif) This most probably occurred via successive gene duplication events, as I described above. 

 

The larger scale example is Hox genes. Hox genes are developmental control genes found in animals. They control large-scale developmental patterns, and are found in clusters. [Arthropods \(insects and their relatives\) have one hox cluster in their genomes, mammals have four hox clusters, Some fish may have six.](http://www.trinity.edu/klivings/3421-F07/buswold_john_1.jpg) The interesting thing here is that the individual hox genes of the original cluster probably arose through sequential gene duplication; one gene became two, became four, etc. But the clusters probably arose through sequential *genome* duplication; one cluster becomes two, becomes four. If you sequence the hox genes, you find homologous genes within each cluster *and between clusters*. As expected, you also find pseudogenes – genes that lost their function after duplication. One cluster might have 13, another just nine. It’s a beautiful example of the power of gene duplication and mutation to generate novel genetic information and increase biological complexity. 

 

Creationists, if this process *isn’t* at work, what's your explanation, and why is it better?

414,Human Chromosome 2 Strongly Supports the Common Ancestry of Chimps and Humans,19,True,"One of the strongest single pieces of evidence for evolution in general, and the common ancestry of humans and chimps specifically, is the structure of the human and chimpanzee genomes. I don't mean the % that is identical between the two, I mean the actual number, size, and structure of the chromosomes themselves.

 

Humans have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs: 1-22, plus XX or XY. Chimps have 48 chromosomes in 24 pairs, and every chimp chromosome exactly matches a human chromosome in size and banding pattern, with the exception of human chromosome 2. You will not find a chromosome in the chimpanzee genome that looks like human chromosome 2.

 

As you might expect, there are 2 chimp chromosomes that don't have a match in the human genome. Those two go by different names - sometimes 12 and 13, and sometimes, for reasons I'll discuss, 2A and 2B, or 2P and 2Q. I've seen all three ways. 

 

First, a bit on chromosome structure. There are several distinct regions that each chromosome has. At either end, you have a distinct sequence called a telomere. In the middle, you have a centromere. All chromosomes have two telomeres and one centromere. The nucleotide sequences of telomeres and centromeres are highly conserved, and easily recognizable. 

 

If you look at human chromosome 2, you see exactly what you would expect: Telomeres at either end, a centromere in the middle. But if you look more closely, you see something interesting: The remnants of two telomeres, back-to-back, smack in the middle of the chromosome. And not far away, the remnants of a no-longer-used centromere. 

 

If you line up the two renegade chimp chromosomes with human chromosome 2, you can see exactly what happened: Chromosomal fusion. Two chromosomes fused into one. The no-longer-used telomeres and centromeres were able to mutate without harming the organism, and slowly drifted away from their specific, tightly-controlled sequences, but slowly enough to still be recognizable in human chromosome 2. 

 

The sequencing of the human and chimp genomes was a great test of evolutionary theory. If we share a common ancestor, the genomes should be very similar, and there should be explanations for any major differences. That was a testable prediction. If we found genomes that were completely dissimilar, that would have been a problem for common ancestry. Instead, they're extremely similar, and there was a crystal-clear explanation for the only major difference. Hypothesis supported. 

 

How does creation offer a better explanation for these observation? Or, what testable predictions does creation make regarding the common ancestry of humans and other apes?

415,"Let's Stop Pretending Otherwise, Intelligent Design = Creationism",15,True,"EDIT: I think we all know what I mean by ""ID"" in this context, but apparently I have to state it explicitly. Philip Johnson, Dembski, Behe, Meyer, Discovery Institute, etc. That's the ID I'm talking about. 

Original post:
This came up in another thread, and I think it’s important enough that it deserves it own.

Intelligent design is creationism. Period. The intelligent design movement was an effort to circumvent the 1987 Edwards v. Aguillard decision from the Supreme Court, in which the Court ruled that teaching creation science was a violation of the Establishment Clause. There’s lot’s of evidence for this claim, so I’m going to describe just a few of the critical pieces, focusing on “Of Pandas and People,” the intelligent design textbook ([if you can call it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0_utZaJUL0)). ""Of Pandas and People"" was the title of later editions. Originally, it was called “Creation Biology.”

 

Between the different versions, very little changed. Really, the big difference was the replacement of all references to creation and creationism with discussion of design, a designer, etc. And when I say replacement, I mean replacement. Here’s the definition of of creation from the pre-Edwards 1987 edition:

""Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.""

 

And here’s the definition of intelligent design from the post-Edwards edition from later in 1987:

""Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, et cetera.""

 

In fact, [the terms where switched out throughout the book after Edwards.](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/debate1pp-intelligentdesignvsdarwinianevolution-140210183006-phpapp02/95/should-intelligent-design-replace-the-darwinian-theory-of-evolution-contra-16-638.jpg)

 

But the change-over wasn't done perfectly. Enter my favorite piece of evidence, a true evolutionary intermediate, [cdesign proponentsists.](http://ncseweb.org/creationism/legal/cdesign-proponentsists) Turns out they didn't do the replacing perfectly, and one instance of ""creationists"" got turned into ""cdesign proponentsists"" instead of the intended ""design proponents."" Oops.

 

This is already long enough, so I’ll leave it at cdesign proponentsists. Intelligent design is creationism with a new name. So for those on the side of science, let’s not let creationsists get away with the word games, yeah? And for those on the side of creation, own it.

417,For ID Proponents: The SETI Challenge,8,True,"This is a challenge directed at those who accept ID.  In particular, it is directed at those who believe ID is a useful technique for determining whether something was designed by an intelligence.

It is often claimed by ID proponents, including in [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4fdz4t/intelligent_design_quick_tutorial_and_ama/d2945a5) that SETI would benefit from using ID techniques.  The idea is that using ID techniques would allow SETI to find signals it currently can't.

So here is a chance for ID proponents to show what ID can do.  I will create 10 signals, one of which contains useful information, the other 9 don't.  The signals will be a sampled analog signals containing a digital signal encoded in an unknown manner.  To show that ID has benefits over current SETI approaches, the signal will be a broadband signal using an encoding not typically used on Earth.  

I will know which one is the signal, how it is encoded, and what it is encoding, but you won't.  I will verify that the digital data is recoverable from the signal, but ID proponents will not be required to actually recover the data, only identify which analog signal contains the data.

The issue, though, is that I don't know what is and is not possible with ID.  So I ask that ID proponents describe specifically what sort of constraints they require on the analog signal, encoding scheme, and digital signal in order to allow them to identify it.  Things like number of samples, number of bits in the digital signal, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.  Note that this is supposed to simulate detecting intelligent design from a species we know absolutely nothing about, so specifying a particular encoding scheme, signal bandwidth, or digital sequence is not allowed.

Please show your work, such as including any equations or code you used to do the analysis.

Once I have some idea what I should create, I will create the 10 signals then edit this post to include them.

More specifically, it is an attempt to get ID supporters to justify one of their claims that I so far have not been able to get them to provide any specifics about.  Whether ID is science is certainly a valid debate but it is outside the scope of this thread. I would also like to avoid a semantic debate about the definition of ID.

420,"Abiogenesis via the RNA World. Creationists, can you do better?",6,True,"Here’s a plausible scenario for abiogenesis. How is your alternative better, Creationists? 

 

Before I get into the nitty-gritty, a couple of notes. First, this is **one** scenario, based on the RNA World hypothesis, which posits that RNA was the first self-replicating molecule and genetic material, with proteins and DNA coming later. Second, and this is critical, each step of this process has been observed in the laboratory setting. Third, the experiments that have modeled these processes did not involve any design input into the sequences of the RNA molecules nor the arrangement of the fatty acid structures involved. So don’t pull a “well the scientists designed everything so this is design/creationism.” Setting the conditions and/or selective pressures is not the same thing as designing the molecules. 

 

That all being said, here’s how life could have started. 

 

First, you have the spontaneous formation of small organic molecules. Among these are RNA nucleotides and fatty acids. You also get amino acids, but we’re going to ignore those. (If you we’re talking Protein World hypothesis, you’d focus on those and ignore the RNA at first.) This has been observed in more recent and comprehensive versions of the Miller-Urey experiment. 

 

Once you have your RNA nucleotides, they can self-assemble into oligonucleotides of dozens to hundreds of bases long. This process has been observed under conditions that are likely to have existed on a young earth. Specifically, certain types of volcanic clays, such as montmorillonite, have been shown to catalyze RNA polymerization. Given these materials and heat, polymerization occurs. 

 

Montmorillonite also greatly accelerates the assembly of fatty acids into hollow spheres called liposomes. Importantly, liposomes are a hallow ball composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which is the primary structural component of cell membranes. 

 

Now, the really interesting thing here is that you can when you put these three things (RNA nucleotides, fatty acids, montmorillonite) together, you get liposomes with RNA polymers inside them. So we have structures that look like cells. But that’s only part of the puzzle.

 

A critical component of this theory is the ability of RNA molecules to catalyze reactions. These molecules are called ribozymes. The ribosome is the best known example of a ribozyme. There are ribozymes that can self-replicate under the right conditions. They can make a copy of themselves, then cleave the new copy from the old, resulting in two identical molecules. The spontaneous appearance of functional RNA sequences has been well-documented experimentally, going back to the early 90’s. These experiments used a process called in-vitro evolution to generate random RNA oligonucleotides, then select for the ones that could do some function – bind to something, replicate, cleave, whatever. Then they are improved by successive rounds of sloppy copying – introducing mutations – and further selection. 

 

So to summarize thus far, you can spontaneously get ribozymes in liposomes under early-earth conditions. And each part of this process has been observed experimentally. And here’s where it gets interesting.

 

If you have active self-replicating ribozymes in liposomes, those liposomes will grow. As RNA nucleotides are assembled by active ribozymes, that changes the osmotic balance between the inside and outside of the liposome, causing water to flow inward. This puts pressure on the liposome to expand, and as a result, liposomes housing self-replicating ribozymes grow by taking up free fatty acids from the environment **and** by stealing them from non-growing liposomes (i.e. liposomes that do not contain active ribozymes). 

 

I want to pause right here to point out an extremely important component of this process: Selection. This process – growing due to osmotic pressure and stealing lipids, or shrinking due to a lack of change in osmotic pressure – is positive selection acting on self-replication. So once it appears, self-replicating sequences will increase in frequency, while non-replicating sequences will decrease. This is **critical**, as it is the first step in this process in which a specific property of life (replication) is selected for. All of the other things happened through physical processes and chance. 

 

So you have selection for self-replication and liposomes growing. But they cannot grow indefinitely. Once a liposome gets too big to be stable, it splits in two. Now instead of having one large liposome containing a mix of free nucleotides and self-replicating ribozymes, you have two smaller ones. This process has been observed in the lab, and results in surprisingly little loss of the internal contents back out into the environment. 

 

These structures, liposomes containing actively self-replicating ribozymes, are called protocells. They grow and divide, they contain genetic information that can copy itself, and they have an internal environment that is both separate and different from the outside environment. However, they are **not** cells. They do not carry out metabolism, and both the self-replication of their RNA and the growth and division of the protocells is driven by purely physical forces, not what we would recognize as cellular energetic pathways. But they are darn close to cells, and the incorporation of amino acids was probably the next big step in the process. 

 

Some objections:

Chirality: Self-replication appeared in molecules of one chirality first (randomly), and that dictated what chirality monomers would be incorporated from then on. 

Never been observed from start to finish: That would take too long. Each step has been modeled, which is realistically as much as you’re gonna get. 

RNA to DNA transition: RNA and DNA can hybridize (i.e. form base pairs), and there are examples of stable DNA-RNA hybrids that you can find today (e.g. some viral genomes). DNA is more stable (i.e. mutates more slowly) than RNA, so using DNA for storage instead of RNA would be favored by selection in some (but not all) circumstances. 

Appearance of proteins: Yup, to my knowledge, we don’t really know, so you can use this objection if you’re comfortable using an argument from ignorance. 

RNA mutates too fast - error catastrophe: It actually doesn't. Only the fastest-mutating RNA viruses exist near the error catastrophe threshold. RNA viruses and some single-stranded DNA viruses **may** be susceptible to error catastrophe via chemical mutagenesis, but the evidence is ambiguous. It's just not as big a problem as it's made out to be. 

 

So that’s a quick overview of the RNA world hypothesis. It is a plausible pathway from organic monomers to macromolecules to protocells. Remember, **there is experimental evidence for each step in this process**. It is by no means certain nor complete, but it is a robust theory with extensive experimental support. 

 

For creation to be a better theory than the RNA world, it must demonstrate **more** support, and must be shown to be **more plausible**, than the RNA world hypothesis. Creationists: Can you provide a better alternative?

Prayer works but scientists don't want to face this, so they exclude god. Richard Dawkins said that evolution is a tool by atheists.

The main point is, mutation rates are so alarmingly high that humans could only have existed for about 6000 years more or less. Mutations accumulate way to fast so we only just had the time to survive until now (after we disembarked from the ark).
The same can be said about the mutations of evil prokaryotes. Shit, there are way too many! I researched how many years we could have possibly endured this. More or less 600 years, the math checks out.

Atheists scientists found some human bones but since the Piltdown man was a known fraud (atheists scientists working under methodological naturalism didn't question the piltdown fossil because it debunked adam and eve) we can easily disregard the human fossil record.

The second law of thermodynamics and information theory tells us that for the universe to have contained all the information at t=0 there need to exist an infinite amount of universes. Since the multiverse theory is debunked, we can only assume that all the information was *not* there from the beginning of the universe, which obviously debunks common descent somehow and further proves creation.

With intelligent design, we can infer *tentatively* that something is supernatural. Hence whenever we see something we can't quite explain, we can infer ID theory (the law I made up) so for example, ATP synthase is clearly intelligently designed (since we don't know how it evolved) so it was tentatively created.

423,"Methodological Naturalism is an Unfounded Presupposition, and Should be Replaced With a Weaker, More Inclusive Assumption",0,True,"Methodological Naturalism is an Unfounded Presupposition, and Should be Replaced With a Weaker, More Inclusive Assumption

[NOTE: This is not merely a theological rant, but rather an analysis of the foundations of the presupposition of [Methodological Naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29#Methodological_naturalism).]

The atheist [Norwood Russel Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood_Russell_Hanson) [wrote](http://enoch2112.tripod.com/MurrayDivHid.htm):

> ... 'God exists' *could* in principle be established for all factually—it just happens not to be, certainly not for everyone! Suppose, however, that next Tuesday morning, just after breakfast, all of us in this one world are knocked to our knees by a percussive and ear-shattering thunderclap. Snow swirls; leaves drop from the trees; the earth heaves and buckles; buildings topple and towers tumble; the sky is ablaze with an eerie, silvery light. Just then, as all the people of this world look up, the heavens open—the clouds pull apart—revealing an unbelievably immense and radiant-like Zeus figure, towering above us like a hundred Everests. He frowns darkly as lightening plays across the features of his Michelangeloid face. He then points down—*at me!*—and explains, for every man and child to hear: 'I have had quite enough of your too-clever logic-chopping and word-watching in matters of theology. Be assured, N.R. Hanson, that I most certainly do exist.'

You may be inclined to dismiss this as a playful, irreverent Disney-oid contrivance, due to the literary devices that Hanson employs, such as specifying that it occur ""next Tuesday morning, just after breakfast."" But Hanson adds:

> ... Please do not dismiss this as a playful, irreverent Disney-oid contrivance. The conceptual point here is that *if* such a remarkable event were to occur, I for one should certainly be convinced that God does exist. That matter of fact would have been settled once and for all time... That God exists would, through this encounter, have been confirmed for me and for everyone else in a manner every bit as direct as that involved in any non-controversial factual claim.

Similarly, atheist [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) [stated](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3044365-the-god-delusion), ""If all [all? *ALL*? does *ALL* the evidence turn in favor of evolutionism? I think not!] the evidence in the universe turned in favour of creationism, I would be the first to admit it, and I would immediately change my mind. As things stand, however, all available evidence (and there is a vast amount of it) favours evolution.""

I can't find the direct quote and so must paraphrase, but atheist [Bertrand Russel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) was once asked, ""If you are wrong, and you come before God after your death, what question would you have for Him?"" He replied, ""Why didn't you clearly reveal yourself?"" ...I'm sure Russel's actual retort was far more eloquent than my memory of it.

I could supply similar quotes by other eminent atheists such as Hume and Nietzsche. By making such statements, they are acknowledging that certain evidences in this natural world could definitively establish the facthood of God's existence, if only they occurred, but which they claim do not.

---

###There is a problem here...

... the problem is Methodological Naturalism (MN)!

Whether a person is a Philosophical Naturalist or not, anyone who employs MN when observing and analyzing the natural world cannot, by presupposition, find a shred of the evidence of the kind that the above atheists claim would convince them of God or His creation.

As the judge in the [Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District) case opined in his *Memorandum Opinion*:

> Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science.

""[S]upernatural explanations may be important and have merit""? What does that mean? Does that mean that they may be **true**? If it doesn't, then it is meaningless gibberish. If it does, then that implies that any naturalistic explanation for that phenomenon is **false**, and science based on such a presupposition leads to false evidences, analyses and conclusions.

If the thinkers referenced above base their science on MN, which I'm sure they would acknowledge, then it is not possible for them to arrive to the conclusions to which they claim they would arrive; but if, on the other hand, they would dispense with MN when making their analyses, then they are not in accordance with the stated scientific presupposition of MN. They are stuck in a paradox.

###There is a solution! 

But first, let us examine the problem that MN attempts to address.

At times, science has operated under two dogmatic principles that impeded its progress:

* **Once a supernatural cause is attributed, the analysis is final.** This is not in keeping with good science, which is and should always be tentative.

* **If a phenomenon cannot be understood, then it is assumed to have a supernatural cause.** Hence all the attributions of eclipses, earthquakes, thunder, etc. to the supernatural. This makes supernatural attribution nothing more than a ""catch-all"". This is no good; however, it would not impede science, as long as the first dogmatic principle is not followed. My objection to this principle is that it dilutes the claim of supernatural agency, causing many to overlook the significance of proper inferences to the supernatural.

But, what is it about the phenomenon that Hanson describes that makes him accept it as from God, in spite of his presumably MN presuppositions?

I posit that it is because the phenomenon exudes Intelligent Design!

Although I find that atheists invariably demand spectacular, incontrovertible, even personal-in-your-face evidence, the essence of the evidence is that it undeniably originates from a non-natural intelligent agent. In Hanson's example, he demands that God call him out, *by name*, in the presence of all mankind; is Hanson willing to stand by patiently as God personally calls out the other seven billion earthlings? If God were to allocate a mere ten seconds to each of His human creatures, it would take twenty-thousand years for Him to address all mankind; in fact, there are over two births per second, so God would be continuously falling further behind. Clearly, Hanson is setting the bar much higher than is necessary, or even reasonable. Nevertheless, his example, which he says is sincere, demonstrates that even the hardest-core atheistic Methodological Naturalist will overlook his MN presuppositions in the face of sufficient natural evidence of a certain kind.

And what kind is that? In Hanson's case, the evidence he would find convincing doesn't violate any natural law, except one: the law of probability. All the phenomena *could happen*, it's just extremely, extremely improbable. But that is the essence of ID theory evidence—it exhibits great complexity, and thus high improbability. Now, it would be possible to use such evidence to invalidate the law of probability, but it makes more sense, in light of the message that this improbable phenomenon presents, to simply accept it as a *supernatural* violation of probability—that is, a miracle.

###My suggestion:

I suggest that we (scientists and mere observers of nature) recognize that there are theoretically possible situations in which we observe violations of established natural laws, but which do not warrant a claim that those laws have been ""naturally"" violated. Note that the laws are *natural*, and thus are not violated when a supernatural cause is operational.

I see two situations in which a natural law could appear violated, but in which it is more reasonable to infer supernatural agency than to claim that the natural law is no longer a law:

* Situations in which the laws of probability are violated, but where also a message is attached that explains the violation. Now, I am going to give a concrete example, but I ask that you focus on the application of this principle, and not on peripheral issues. Rather than describe a detailed scenario of my own imaginings, I simply offer the ten plagues on Egypt described in The Bible's book of Exodus, chapters 7-12. Now, wait! I am not expecting you to believe this story is true: there certainly is the possibility that this is a mere myth. And please don't ask me what kind of god would inflict this kind of misery on a people; that is a discussion for another time. Just consider whether you would believe your lying eyes if this apocalypse were happening around you, and all sensory inputs were in consensus in reporting that this is really happening. I see it as being similar to the scenario Hanson constructs.

* Situations where the three criteria of Intelligent Design are clearly operating. You may not be convinced by any example provided by ID theory advocates, but we are looking first at the principle itself. If, in principle, ID theory provides a possible reason to invoke supernatural agency, then we can revisit and see if any such evidence actually has been discovered. If it doesn't, then you need to explain what it is about Hanson's scenario that permits invocation of a supernatural explanation (if you accept Hanson's proposition). For an extreme example of ID evidence, consider whether you would infer supernatural causation if scientists discovered the Book of Genesis encoded in our DNA.

###Conclusion

As I say, if you agree with Hanson that the scenario he describes would warrant abrogation of MN and attribution of supernatural agency, then tell me whether you think my suggested modification to MN would be reasonable.

If you don't accept Hanson's scenario, then offer your own scenario that would hypothetically provide evidence of supernatural agency. If you can't do this, then you must accept my accusation that you are *a priori* closed-minded to the possibility of the supernatural, as I claim that Bertrand Russel is.

424,Incompetent Design,7,True,"Numerous creationists and intelligent design advocates say life and the universe are intelligently designed, but it seems the opposite is true.

 

First let us look at the big, **BIG**, picture. The universe as a whole. What do we see? Radiation, which will kill us. Freezing temperatures, which will kill us faster than the radiation. The vacuum of space, which will kill us way before the freezing cold of space will. And if you are near a star or happen to fall into an atmosphere, extreme heat that will kill you way faster than the vacuum of space... if you are lucky. The vast majority of the universe is empty space, so we are also alone and cut off from nearly everything, other than light and radio waves that come from outside our solar system.

 

Then there is the galaxy, which is hurtling toward another galaxy, which will result in the destruction of both and the formation of a new one in a few billion year(again because the universe is so huge and lonely). The many stars in which are held in place by the gravity(both one of the most important forces and yet one of the weakest forces) of a super massive black hole. Anything not eventually consumed by that black hole will probably be flung off into the void of space.

 

Speaking of black holes, all the solar systems in all the galaxies are orbiting stars. Stars are slow burning nuclear bombs of epic proportions which will either burn out, freezing their planets and any life near by, or(the more likely option) will go supernova and burn many planets before eventually collapsing into the black hole and sucking in all near by matter and energy.

 

And yet, if certain religions are right all of this is just to show off the glory of a god, to show us how cool and powerful it is... great job buddy, gold star.

 

What about on the planetary level? the vast majority of our planet is uninhabitable for the most intelligent form of life, the form of life which the universe was supposedly created expressly to support the existence of. It is covered in water, most of which we can't drink unless we first invent a way to remove all the salts from it. Even then the land masses are unstable, with earthquakes and volcanoes. Even if you find a suitable and stable bit of land you have to hope there isn't a fire, or flood, or tornado, or hail storm, or freezing cold temperatures, or extraordinarily hot temperatures that will harm and possible kill you.

 

But what about being alive? Well if you aren't able to make your own food out of sunlight, which there is such an abundance of it is possible to develop cancer because of the exposure to it, you have to find other things to consume in order to stay alive. It is a kill or die world. And if you are a ""prey"" form of life you are still unlucky enough to experience terrible pain the entire time you are being killed for food. If you are a ""predator"" form of life you have to fight for food, and the sometimes the right to mate, possibly risking you own life in both instances.

 

Although even if you are lucky enough to mate you will still die of old age. Or an illness. Or an accident. No matter how good, or smart, or strong, or fast you are, your body will eventually fail and you will cease to be.

 

But before you die, if you are human(which you probably are because you are reading this) you will suffer numerous troubles. Things such as having a blind spot in your vision, suffering back pain because standing upright is bad for your body, knee injuries because again, bad design. The entire time you are alive you will have to fight off bacterial and viral infections, because those exist(for some messed up reason, allegedly). And sometimes the immune system that protects you turns on you and attacks your body instead. You will have to put up with optical illusions because your brain and eyes are easily fooled. You might even be unlucky enough to become addicted to harmful substances, hooray! That is if you are lucky enough to be born in part of the world where is it normal to survive childhood.

430,Long-Term Human Evolution Could Not Have Occurred #1: The Mutation Rate is Too High,0,True,"Evolution requires that the mutation rate not exceed a limit, or a phenomenon called ""[error catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_catastrophe)"" occurs, wherein the rate at which deleterious mutations are produced exceeds the organism's ability to eliminate them via natural selection. This mutation rate is only important in germ cells--the cells that go on to become the offspring of the parents. Muller estimated in 1950^(1) that error catastrophe would be a certainty if the mutation rate were any higher than 1 mutation per offspring. Shortly after DNA and its role in heredity were discovered, geneticists estimated, based on observations, that the mutation rate was in the order of 0.12 to 0.3 mutations per offspring^(2). If this low rate of mutation generation--once every 3-6 generations--were true, I would still argue strongly that it is too high for humans to remove by selection, since, as you will see later, it takes longer than that to eliminate what are called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" (VSDMs). But I won't bother at this point, because the situation has been found to be much worse than this!

In 1986, the mutation rate was alarmingly reported^(3) to be 30, two orders of magnitude higher; the authors opined that such a high number would have ""profound"" implications. More recent research puts the mutation rate higher still, at 100^(4) or 175^(5).

Evolution defenders still held out hope though, because it was thought that only a small portion, perhaps 5%, of the genome held useful (transcribed) information; the rest was labeled ""[junk DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA#Junk_DNA)"", a label that creationists immediately criticized. But if true, that would mean that only 1/20 of mutations were significant. This idea, and the ""junk DNA"" label as well, were effectively put to bed by the [ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE)'s findings, published in 2007. Wikipedia summarizes by saying, among other shocking results:

> The human genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases are associated with at least one primary transcript and many transcripts link distal regions to established protein-coding loci.

> Many novel non-protein-coding transcripts have been identified, with many of these overlapping protein-coding loci and others located in regions of the genome previously thought to be transcriptionally silent.

The ""junk DNA"" portion of the genome is becoming vanishingly small, and based on results up to now, we should expect it to continue to shrink. Basically, ""junk DNA"" is the moniker we place on DNA whose function has not yet been identified. In fact, much of the DNA has been found to transcribe *in both directions*, a property that makes DNA practically impossible to alter advantageously through point mutations.

But wait. We've only considered point mutations up to now.

There are mitochondrial mutations. Since the [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) comprises only 16,569 base pairs, the number of mtDNA mutations is estimated to be less than one per offspring. Yet one evolutionist commented^(6),

> ""We should increase our attention to the broader question of how **(or whether)** organisms can tolerate, in the sense of evolution, a genetic system with such a high mutational burden.""

Then there are insertions, deletions and duplications^(4), of which there can be several per offspring. But since they operate on multiple base pairs each, the number of affected BPs can be substantial.

There are also inversions, translocations and conversions, for which I couldn't find numbers.

So, in summary, humans can conservatively be said to suffer hundreds of deleterious mutations **per offspring!** You have hundreds more deleterious mutations than your parents, and triple that number than your great-grandparents. How could they not be placing an unbearable burden on natural selection to remove? As a young-earth creationist, I claim that we have only been ""devolving"" (evolving downhill) for some hundreds of generations. In a millions-of-years scenario, how could we not be extinct by now?^(7)

There is a great many more problems with long-term human evolution, but I'll have to do more posts. The bed beckons.

431,Thinking Like an Evolutionist,3,True,"I was born in, grew up in, and even went to university in, one of the most leftist, anti-conservative cities in America: Madison, Wisconsin. I attended twelve years of public school there, and you can be sure that I was taught the most refined evolutionary dogma available.

I particularly remember encountering evolutionary explanations in biology class for the intricate mating displays and dazzling colors of male members of many species, especially [birds](https://youtu.be/wTcfDCjBqV0), but also many [mammals](https://youtu.be/Ez7RUSCUhzk?t=64) and even [spiders](https://youtu.be/d_yYC5r8xMI?t=79).

The explanation given was that the female made the mating decision, and she did it on the basis of the spectaularity of the male's coat and dance. Of course, the brightest coat, with the most vivid colors, and the most animated dance won the day, and the male's vitality was closely correlated to the brightness of his coat, so  this ensured that the healthiest male passed on his genes.

But consider, for example, [this peacock feather](http://imgur.com/i9hhwEM). Does the peahen actually care about the fine nuances in this cock's feather? The iridescent colors--caused not by pigments, but by complex thin-film wave interference--does the hen care? How about the three ellipsoids, framing a cardoid, whose geometries require that individual barbs change among multiple spectacular colors with high precision, and the stem terminate at the center of the cardoid--does the hen care? Or that each of the [200 or so feathers](http://imgur.com/wFpvvn9) do not radiate from a single point, but yet position themselves evenly and radially as though they do--does then hen care? If she does, how do [white peacocks](http://imgur.com/4RJBO3M) manage to mate? Notice that of the 200 feathers, about 170 are ""eye"" feathers and the other 30 are ""T"" feathers that beautifully frame the eye feathers in an [ogee curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogee)--does the hen care? [Notice](http://imgur.com/kKLvwsJ) the cock's back, bespeckled with tiny radiant nascent eyes framed in black, set off by the iridescent blue breast, throat and topnotch, with a dozen feathers, naked along their length, but each topped with a little pom-pom--does the hen care? And the black eyes, hidden in a black streak, enveloped above and below by white streaks--does the hen care?

Some evolutionist researchers recently set out to answer at least a subset of these questions. They measured tail lengths and number of ""eyes"" on the fans of numerous peacocks, and rated the cocks based on these indicators of ""quality"". They then collected evidence from 268 matings over a seven-year period. Although not intending to pop evolutionist bubbles, their findings were very disheartening.^(1,2,3,4) They found no correlation between their indicators for cock ""quality"" and mating success! I guess the hen doesn't care.

But there are even more serious porblems with this explanation, and until I was freed from evolutionary encumberances, I could not see them.

Most significantly, we know that there exists an ""evolutionary budget"" for mutations. If an organism is selecting for multiple characteristics, each characteristic's selection rate is reduced proportionately. That is, the sum of all selection rates is a constant. So, if an organism is under severe selection pressure to create beautifully shaped and arranged iridescent feathers and a topknot, it must do so at the expense of other critical objectives, such as eliminating harmful mutations, adapting to changing environmental conditions and developing other novel features that enhance survivability in the contests against other organisms.

Also, why does the hen choose the cock? If she chooses him, what ensures that the best genes are transmitted from her? Why don't they simply do as rats and rabbits do: mate with whomever they encounter. Let their ability to show up for mating be their metric for survivability. This I think, would be the mate selection methodology that evolution would favor.

433,"Centriole biogenesis, and the duplication cycle, amazing evidence of design",0,True,"Centriole biogenesis, and the duplication cycle, amazing evidence of design

The  duplication of eukaryotic cells is a all fine-tuned biochemical processes that depends on the precise structural arrangement of the cellular components. Mitotic cell division is the most fundamental task of all living cells. Cells have intricate and tightly regulated machinery to ensure that mitosis occurs with appropriate frequency and high fidelity.

The only way to make a new cell is to duplicate a cell that already exists. A cell reproduces by performing an orderly sequence of events in which it duplicates its contents and then divides in two.  This cycle of duplication and division, known as the cell cycle, is the essential mechanism by which all living things reproduce. Dividing cells must coordinate their growth. A complex network of regulatory proteins  trigger the different events of the cycle. 

During the cell cylce, eighteen different regulators are required, which order and coordinate the process. Each of these regulators are absolutely essential. If one is missing, the cell cycle is not completed and, the cell cannot duplicate.  Any of these regulators have only use if fully integrated in the process. They have no use or function by themself. This makes  replication a irreducible , interdependent process.

Centrosomes play a key role in organizing the microtubule network of the cell, most notably the mitotic spindle during cell division .

The choreography of microtubules, centrosomes and chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis is beautifully designed, and uses finely regulated and synchronized movements.

The centrosome is a structure, consisting of a pair of cylindrical microtubule-based organelles called centrioles , embedded in an amorphous network of proteins known collectively as Pericentriolar Material (PCM). Microtubules (MTs) originate from the PCM.  The PCM comprises a porous structural scaffold onto which γ-tubulin and other soluble components from the cytoplasm are loaded. Centrosome growth is an aggregation process of a condensed phase of PCM components, which segregate from the cytosol. The aggregation process leads to a centrosome phase that coexists with the cytosol and does rearrange internally. This implies that the centrosome phase is viscoelastic, such that on long timescales it behaves as a liquid-like material.

Cep192 is a pericentriolar protein that accumulates at centrosomes during mitosis and is required for PCM recruitment, centriole duplication, microtubule nucleation, and centrosome maturation.

Centrioles are among the most beautiful of biological structures. How their highly conserved nine-fold symmetry is generated is a question that has intrigued cell biologists for decades.
Centrioles are present in all eukaryotic species that form cilia and flagella, but are absent from higher plants and higher fungi which do not have cilia.
It seems likely that they have  the primary purpose of growing cilia and flagella, which are important sensory and motile organelles found in almost all cells of the human body.  These organelles have many important functions in cells, and their dysfunction has been linked to a plethora of human pathologies, ranging from cancer to microcephaly to obesity.  Great progress has been made recently in understanding how these proteins interact and how these interactions are regulated to ensure that a new centriole is only formed at the right place and at the right time.

Centriole biogenesis requires thirteen essential molecules. If any of these molecules is missing, centrioles cannot be made. 

Centriole assembly is also tightly regulated and abnormalities in this process can lead to developmental defects and cancer. Initiation of centriole duplication is under tight regulation to ensure the control of centriole number. Presumably in centriole initiation, there is some form of cooperativity or positive feedback that results in asymmetric accumulation of the relevant proteins in a symmetric background.

So we have not only the requirement of eighteen proteins required for cell cycle regulation, but also thirteen essential molecules for centriole biogenesis, which by itself is also tighthly regulated, requiring positive feedback.

It appears at the initial stage of the centriole assembly process as the first ninefold symmetrical structure. The cartwheel was first described more than 50 years ago, but it is only recently that its pivotal role in establishing the ninefold symmetry of the centriole was demonstrated.  This is a highly ordered structure that really stands out from the background. Constructed of rod-like microtubules, most centrioles have a nine-fold pattern, nine triplets or doublets evenly spaced at the rim, giving it a ""cartwheel"" appearance in cross-section. 

The comparison to a human made cartwheel is evident, and so that it is intelligently designed. Obviously, the question arises, how could all this emerge gradually ? 

Another amazing fact is that Electromagnetics play an important role in cell functioning and especially in cell duplication and division (mitosis).

Recent development in the field of quantum biology highlights that the intracellular electromagnetic field (EMF) of microtubules plays an important role in many fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis. It is an intriguing hypothesis that centrosome functions as molecular dynamo to generate electric flow over the microtubules, leading to the electric excitation of microtubule EMF that is required for spindle body microtubule self-assembly. With the help of motors proteins within the centrosome, centrosome transforms the energy from ATP into intracellular EMF in the living cell that shapes the functions of microtubules. There will be a general impact for the cell biology field to understand the mechanistic function of centrosome for the first time in correlation with its structural features.



The electromagnetic property of microtubule has been reported with both computation modelling and experimental evidences.

To transform the chemical energy in ATP into electric magnetic field within the living cell, cell needs to have a molecular dynamo to transform the mechanistic movement of protein complexes to directional movements of intracellular electrons, leading to the electric excitation of the spindle body microtubules as well as the M phase chromosomes, which is essential for mitosis

Taken together the longitudinal, or axial, vibration of the 13 filaments of an MT and then the 27 MTs making up the centriole barrel produce the electromagnetic field surrounding the centriole . Interestingly, this field is also found to be ferromagnetic. Also of interest, the fundamental vibration frequency of an MT filament is approximately 465 MHz, although this frequency is continually changing due to the ongoing length changing of the filaments. The electropolarity of the centrioles enables them to exert forces at a distance—that is, forces without physical contact.

All this cannot leave us asounded and v   indicates the requirement of forsight to produce all these ingenius mechanisms,and subsequently a intelligent designer.

436,Information Theory tells us that life could not have evolved.,1,True,"Just about everyone is aware of the fact that the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) (SLoT) places some severe and disappointing constraints on the universe we inhabit. First, we know that we are all doomed to die, even if we were to conquer sickness and aging, or even if we become computer states *à la* the Matrix, because the universe will eventually run out of usable energy, called ""[heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)"". Second, it is not possible to build a [perpetual motion machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion); all useful mechanisms increase the entropy of the universe, hastening the aforementioned heat death. The only good news is that heat death is billions of years in the future.

Frequently, creationists argue that the SLoT says that we are going downhill, which is the opposite direction that evolution says we are going. Evolutionists counter that the SLoT is only valid for a *closed system* (which is true) and the earth's biosphere is an open system, constantly receiving fresh low-entropy energy from the sun. Nevertheless, the creationists are correct, but it is not the objective of this article to argue that point (so please don't comment on it).

---

Rather, I want to examine the implications of Information Theory on evolution.

Regarding [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information), Wikipedia states that:

> Information resolves uncertainty. The uncertainty of an event is measured by its **probability of occurrence** and is inversely proportional to that [probability]. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the [nat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_%28unit%29) may be used. [emphasis mine]

In Wikipedia's article on the ""[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)"", it states:

> In information theory, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal **probability**, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known. [emphasis mine]

Notice that the amount of information in a message is related to **probability**; information is defined by its **probability**. The more information in a message, the lower its **probabilty**.

In fact, in Wikipedia's article on [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), it states:

> Shannon [[Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_E._Shannon), the Bell Labs researcher that penned the seminal paper on information theory in 1948] discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity [discussed earlier], is logarithmic, i.e.,

>     I(p) = log(1/p)

where I is the information contained in a message, and p is the **probability** that the message can occur. If the logarithm is to the base 2, then the information I is measured in bits.

---

Now, let's think a little about what probability is: it is the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging in value from 0 to 1 inclusive, where p=0 means it *cannot* occur, p=0.5 means there is a 50% chance it will occur, and p=1 means it *must* occur.

But one interesting corollary of this is: a system that is currently in a low-probability state will tend to migrate over time to higher-probability states, when undirected influences are acting on the system. After all, this is really what it means for an event to be ""probable"". For example, say you have a box containing four pennies, all ""heads"". If you shake the box softly so that a few coins are jostled, the coins will gravitate towards a 50-50 ratio of heads to tails. This is because there are more ""ways"" to get a 50-50 mixture than any other ratio. As Pascal described in his treatise on [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) (by the way, Pascal was a Christian creationist, who also gave us [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager)),

* For 0 heads, p = 1/16 (TTTT)
* For 1 heads, p = 4/16 = 1/4 (TTTH, TTHT, THTT, HTTT)
* For 2 heads, p = 6/16 = 3/8 (TTHH, THTH, THHT, HTTH, HTHT, HHTT)
* For 3 heads, p = 4/16 = 1/4 (THHH, HTHH, HHTH, HHHT)
* For 4 heads, p = 1/16 (HHHH)

The above is row 4 of Pascal's triangle.

But there is a specific relationship between an event (or ""message"") and the amount of information it conveys, given by the logarithmic relationship stated above. As the probability of an event increases, the amount of information decreases.

Now, there exists a stunning similarity between thermodynamic entropy, H, and information theory entropy, S. So much so, that Wikipedia devotes a [separate article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory) to its discussion. Notice that both H and S are functions of the probabilities of the microstates of their respective systems (please refer to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory), since mathematical notation cannot be easily represented in Reddit's [Markdown Language](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)). There are only two minor differences: first, H is customarily calculated using the natural logarithm (base ε) and S is customarily calculated using base 2. However, this is only custom, and changing the base of the logarithm simply changes the logarithm by a constant factor. In fact, information can be calculated base ε, resulting in information expressed in [nats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_%28unit%29) instead of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). The second difference is another constant factor in H: the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), which, being a constant, also does not impact the comparison being made here.

The point is this: just as thermodynamic entropy never decreases, so information theory entropy never decreases. If we take the ""closed system"" being considered in both cases to be the entire universe, this means that:

* the total useful energy in the universe is ""leaking out"", and will eventually be totally lost; and
* the total information in the universe is ""leaking out"", and will eventually be totally lost.

It also means that:

* it is impossible to add useful energy to the universe; and
* it is impossible to add information to the universe.

Now, if we can agree that DNA contains information, this leads to the astounding conclusion that the universe had to contain *more* information at its creation than will ever exist in the universe thereafter! We can say one thing, even if we can't agree on DNA: if there was no information in the universe at t=0, there never would be any information in the entire universe at any time thereafter.

But DNA *does* contain information. As the Wikipedia article on [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) clearly and unequivocally states, ""DNA stores biological information."" And that amount of information is COLOSSAL. There is enough information in all the DNA of all the various living organisms to specify not only the current state of all those organisms, but how to manufacture every single organism ""after its kind"". And there was more information in the past, to specify all the organisms that have since gone extinct.

And the information isn't just in the DNA. Every cell is improbable, because it is *living*. There are far, *far*, FAR more states that the molecules in every living cell could be in that do not have the special characteristic of imparting life. This is why we can puncture the wall of a cell, thus killing it, but we have never succeeded in ""un-puncturing"" the cell and restoring life to it. Loss of information is a one-way street, and unless huge amounts of external information are inserted, death cannot be undone (though Goodness knows, we've tried).

Irreducible complexity keeps being a unsurmountable problem for the ones that propose unguided evolution and natural mechanisms to explain  the origin of life and biodiversity in general. No attempt to refute and successfully debunk the argument has been brought forward so far. Eyery attempt, no exception, has failed. Why ? Because IC is a undeniable FACT, no matter what. And this FACT becomes obvious to the unbiased mind  when we envision biological systems as complex molecular machines, that operate similar to man made machines, but far far more complex. Individual parts have no function by themself. This is a important point to highlight. What use does the wing of a airplaine  have alone? None. The engineer has to envision a function for the wing, used as essential part of the design of the airplane as a whole in order to fly, and its use once the airplane is fully built with all parts in place.  The wing must be made with the right specifications, size, materials, form, and placed and mounted at the right place in the right way. And the wing itself requires complex machines to be made. The right materials must be transported to the building site. Often these materials in their raw form are unusable. Other complex machines come into play to transform the raw materials into usable form.  All this requires specific information.   The precise same thing happens in biological systems. Even the most simple cell useses inumerous parts, that have no use by their own. For what reason would natural mechanisms create these parts , if there were no use for them individually ? This is a problem that stretches through all biology, from the simplest to the most complex. Biological systems do only achieve specific tasks, once a number of individual parts are made upon  specific complex instructions, frequently through other specific machines or even factories and assembly lines, that have no other tasks than to build these specific parts, and all this through the instructions of the  blueprint in the genome, and then other specific instructions provide the information of how, when , and where to mount the parts to form the complex machine. Same as done when building human made machines. And all these processes must be strictly controlled, with error check and feedback mechanisms, and if something is not build upon the right specification, complex repair machines fix the problem. These checking and repair systems must be fully operational from day one, otherwise, the organism dies. And energy in usable form must also be provided ,and the make of energy requires also complex machinery which by itself requires energy to be made ( chicken-egg problem ). Furthermore, internal and external communication networks must be established.  Also all these machines are made to self replicate , which adds a hudge amount of further complexity into the picture. Self replication is far from simple. It demands the most complex molecular machinery, which works in a astonishing , beautyful, orchestrated , regulated and controlled manner. Why at all would natural unguided, non-intelligent chemical reactions have the need to produce living biological systems, and keep them existing through self replication?",1463923891,33,2016-05-22 09:31:31

According to [here]( http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mreimers/SysBio/Gingeras%20-%20Transcriptome%20complexity.pdf), “…the amount of transcription [that is, RNA production] that occurs cannot be entirely accounted for by current sets of genome-wide annotations. Evidence indicates that most of both strands of the human genome might be transcribed…”

> But there’s no way for that to evolve. If you modify one strand, you modify the other. A single mutation to the antisense strand would only serve to delete the information in the sense strand long before it would create any information in the antisense strand. 
So even if you got information on the antisense strand, you’d be back having useless gibberish on the sense strand. 

> To get information on both strands, you need the sequences on both strands to be very carefully arranged together. That’s complicated, delicate work mutations are completely incapable of - you need a very wise intelligence planning it out beforehand.

> So, if Creation is true, we’d expect information on both strands. If evolution is true, we’d expect (and its been wrongfully thought to be the case that) only one strand contains useful information.

> Creation can lead us to places we never would have found – or would have found much less quickly – if we thought evolution were true. Hopefully I can be living proof of this with my career – that’s a major reason I chose biology. ",1463390463,20,2016-05-16 05:21:03
441,"Methodological Naturalism is a belief, and it is no more based on evidence, logic and critical thinking than Theism (e.g., Christianity) is.",0,True,"In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4j0aax/im_trying_to_convince_my_creationist_cousin_of/) thread, /u/FLSun said to an evolutionist regarding his creationist cousin:

> The problem is that you and your cousin use different ""Methods"" or ""Tools"" to decide what is true or false.
> You use **Evidence, Logic and Critical Thinking Skills** to decide if something is true or false. You know the Earth is a sphere because of the evidence we have.

You, my friend /u/FLSun, ""believe"" in Methodological Naturalism without scientific basis, and with conviction and fervor that I'm sure would put many creationists to shame.

Methodological Naturalism (MN), the assumption that all natural phenomena have natural causes, is scientifically untestable. I say this because MN is a fundamental *assumption* of ""modern"" science. One methodology—science—cannot impartially examine another methodology—MN—upon which it is based; science assumes MN, so contradicting evidence cannot be entertained.

In addition, Methodological Naturalism **IS**, for all intents and purposes, Philosophical Naturalism. Else, what sense would it make for scientists to assume it?

The basic argument for MN's implementation is quite simple: without MN, *any* unexplained phenomenon can attributed to supernatural intervention (""god of the gaps""). Lightning, earthquakes, eclipses, gravity, first life, etc. can be explained as ""God's hand"" at work. This is a science-stopper, since God can capriciously do whatever He wants.

Much progress has been made in science by assuming that there is no supernatural causal agency. The problem is, scientists have lost sight of the fact that MN is an assumption, and now think that science has ""proven"" that there is no supernatural, mistakenly believing that science has found no evidence for supernatural activity. The fact is, the evidence is all around us, but is dismissed. Since MN demands that every phenomenon MUST have a natural cause, the most flimsy excuse for evidence of natural cause is heralded as a rigorously comprehensive explanation. Examples are everywhwere (such as the **fable** of abiogenesis vs. the **Law** of Biogenesis), but I would like to keep the focus of this thread on MN, rather than digressing into analyses of specific cases.

Let me quickly outline the classical argument for MN and show why it is faulty. The argument goes as follows: 

1.) Natural events obey natural laws, which are descriptions of relationships that regularly occur;

2.) Miracles are one-time exceptions to natural laws;

3.) Because natural laws regularly occur, they have much supporting evidence;

4.) Because miracles occur only once, they have little supporting evidence;

4.) Therefore, science should go with the preponderance of evidence, and consider only natural events.

The basic problem with this argument is that science examines two kinds of phenomena:

* **Regular Phenomena**, events that occur repeatedly and consistently. In the examination of regular phenomena, the intent is to propose hypotheses that will be modified as necessary and hopefully developed into laws, as confirming evidence accumulates. This is the realm of the *scientific method*, where repeatability, testability and (theoretical) falsifiability reign.
* **Historical Phenomena**, events that occur only once. These events cannot be repeated (although they sometimes can be re-enacted), but must be examined in more of an evidentiary manner, similar to the way evidence is gathered and analyzed in forensics for a court case. 

Scientists sometimes look with disdain upon the historical ""sciences"", such as the historians of WWII, as not true science. But in fact, historical science pervades the scientific arena. Archaeology, paleontology, and much of geology are historical. In fact, many of the most actively researched areas of science are historical, examining one-time events:

* The ""Big Bang"",
* The origin of life, and even
* evolution itself

are all one-time historical events that are out of the reach of the true scientific method.

I claim that it is silly to assume MN unless MN is in fact true, and MN cannot be tested scientifically as long as MN is an axiomatic foundation for science.

So then, what are we to do, if we want to avoid ""god of the gaps"" *ad hoc* explanations of natural events, and yet allow for the possibility that naturalism is an incorrect philosophical position?

First, we have to realize and acknowledge that the founders of modern science—Newton, Kepler and others—were supernaturalists who, in spite of (in fact, because of) their ""beliefs"", were able to found and fuel the modern scientific era. How were they able to differentiate between events with natural causes and events with supernatural causes?

I claim that there are times (I can think of two) when it can be demonstrated that certain natural phenomena defy naturalistic explanation, and it is a red herring to be concerned that allowing for the possibility of supernatural agency will cripple science.

#### 1. Microbes are more abundant than humans

* There are one-thousand billion *billion* BILLION (10^(30)!) bacteria alone in the biosphere, plus viruses and other microbes.
* That means there are many thousands of times more *bacteria* alive today than there are *cells* in every human that ever lived!

#### 2. Microbes are more fecund than humans

* For sexual creatures, 2 parents produce 1 child.
* For asexual creatures, 1 parent produces 2 children.
* For virues, oftentimes one parent produces many hundreds of offspring.

#### 3. Microbes reproduce faster than humans

* For humans, a generation is 25 years.
* For microbes a generation may be as short as 20 minutes!

#### 4. There are many more “species” of microbes, each of which is a potential enemy

* For asexual microbes, the concept of ""species"" is essentially meaninglss.
* Each mutated microbe can constitute a new threat to humans and other higher animals.

#### 5. Microbes are simpler

* Our defenses, such as the immune system, are extremely complex, and fall out of tune with time.
* Microbes are far simpler, and thus mutate more quickly and easily into a better-adapted form.

#### 6. Microbes are everywhere, travel everywhere, and survive/thrive in every extreme environment

* There are over 100 million bacteria of over 600 species in every milliliter of saliva in your mouth! They inhabit your body openings, bodily fluids, and cuts in your skin.
* “Extremophiles” inhabit the “dead” sea, boiling-hot geysers and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, as well as deadly acidic, basic, salty, oxygen-less, waterless, high-sugar, high-metal, high-pressure, and high-radiation environments.
* Microbes inhabit the stratosphere, 11-31 miles up, where they tolerate simultaneous low pressure, high radiation, and absence of water and nutrients.
* Microbes travel by the wind, bird, [land] animal, fish, and even jet!
* Microbes doubtless preceded humans to the moon (1959: USSR’s Luna 2), mars (1982: NASA’s Viking 1), and even beyond the solar system (Voyager 1, currently ~132 astronomical units out)

#### 7. We are utterly dependent on microbes!

* We cannot avoid contact with microbes, since we depend on them for our very existence.
* Humans have more “gut flora” in their digestive tract than cells in their body! Microbes help break down our food, and we can’t live without them.
* Microbes perform the essential task of breaking down organic waste and preparing it for re-use.

##### Conclusion: All survival advantage is to the microbe. Man could not possibly have won in this struggle, but should have been driven to extinction eons ago if truly this battle raged for millions of years.

449,The oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II is irreducible complex,0,True,"The key process that produces oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) , which splits water molecules and subsequently releases molecular oxygen. This process, which occurs in photosystem II (PSII), is driven by the conversion of visible light to chemical energy. Electrons oxidize water, which leads to the evolution of molecular oxygen and the release of protons into the thylakoid lumen. This proton gradient is a major contributor to the proton motive force used to biosynthesize ATP from ADP via ATP synthase. 

The OEC is composed of a cluster of manganese, calcium and chloride ions bound to extrinsic proteins. In plants there are four (PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ and PsbR). Maintenance of the highly dynamic Mn4CaO5 cluster also requires the delivery of a constant supply of the proper levels of Mn2+ and Ca2+. The mechanism of water oxidation has remained virtually unchanged between green plants and cyanobacteria, and is similar in all higher plants. Simpler mechanisms are unknown. 

Each of the extrinsic proteins of plants are ESSENTIAL, and each was tested upon mutated form, and the mechanism was found inefficient, and compromising the OEC function. Furthermore, a water network around the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and D1 protein subunit of PSII are also absolutely necessary. Each protein and the Mn4CaO5 cluster has no function by its own, only, if duly embedded and working in the whole mechanism. It could therefore not provide any survival advantage to the organism, unless everything is set up. Its the same as to ask what good a piston motor would be by its own ? It has no function , unless duly mounted and well matched inside the motor block. 

There is no ignorance, but based on the scientific evidence of mutation experiments WE DO KNOW OEC absolutely requires each protein and a precisely arranged Mn4CaO5 cluster fully evolved and set up. 

1. High information content (or specified complexity) and irreducible complexity constitute strong indicators or hallmarks of (past) intelligent design.
2. Biological systems have a high information content (or specified complexity) and utilize subsystems that manifest irreducible complexity.

451,My contention: PBS gives a faulty argument for common descent,2,True,"""The Human Genome Project is revealing many dramatic examples of how genes have been ""conserved"" throughout evolution -- that is, genes that perform certain functions in lower animals have been maintained even in the human DNA script, though sometimes the genes have been modified for more complex functions. 

This thread of genetic similarity connects us and the roughly 10 million other species in the modern world to the entire history of life, back to a single common ancestor more than 3.5 billion years ago. And the evolutionary view of a single (and very ancient) origin of life is supported at the deepest level imaginable: the very nature of the DNA code in which the instructions of genes and chromosomes are written. In all living organisms, the instructions for reproducing and operating the individual is encoded in a chemical language with four letters -- A, C, T, and G, the initials of four chemicals. Combinations of three of these letters specify each of the amino acids that the cell uses in building proteins. 

**Biologically and chemically, there is no reason why this particular genetic code, rather than any of millions or billions of others, should exist, scientists assert**. Yet every species on Earth carries a genetic code that is, for all intents and purposes, identical and universal. The only scientific explanation for this situation is that the genetic code was the result of a single historic accident. That is, this code was the one carried by the single ancestor of life and all of its descendents, including us.”

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/04/4/l_044_02.html

The argument seems to be that there is no functional reason for God to create life with this feature, or for natural selection to select this code over others: rather, what we are seeing here is the signature of historical contingency: the genetic code has been preserved as a “frozen accident”.

However, I don’t think PBS gets the facts right on this one.

Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London, [writes ](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sQBesPE3ELYC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=nick+lane+genetic+code+freeland&source=bl&ots=9RAztuxlI_&sig=LzO119a6rqUiaIfl21jqoJ2Nt_0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqgOXcko7MAhUO9WMKHY2IDZkQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=nick%20lane%20genetic%20code%20freeland&f=false) ""[[Hurst and Freeland](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732450)] considered the damage that could be done by point mutations, in which one letter of a codon is switched for another. Which code, they wondered, could resist such point mutations best, either by retaining exactly the same amino acid, or by substituting a similar one? They found that the real genetic code is startlingly resistant to change: point mutations often preserve the amino acid sequence, and if a change does occur, a physically related amino acid tends to be substituted. In fact, Hurst and Freeland declared the genetic code to be better than a million alternative randomly generated codes. Far from being the folly of nature's blind cryptographer, the code is one in a million. Not only does it resist change, they say, but also by restricting the catastrophic consequences of the changes that do occur, the code actually speeds up evolution: obviously, mutations are more likely to be beneficial if they are not catastrophic. 
Short of positing celestial design, the only way to explain optimization is via the workings of selection.""

So, I contend that PBS got it wrong when they argued that the genetic code is evidence for common descent because  “there is no reason why this particular genetic code, rather than any of millions or billions of others, should exist”.",1461996882,34,2016-04-30 02:14:42

454,Creationists Take It On the Chin Again : There Was No Flood,6,True,"Creationists Take It On the Chin Again : There Was No Flood

Computer Simulation of Post Flood Re-population Using Discrete Objects to Represent Each Person

Being as it is Sunday lets investigate this a bit. Now the cornerstone of the Creationist argument is the supposed flood at the time of Noah that killed of everything and created the fossils via under water land slides. Of course the other major thing that happened as a result of the flood was the repopulation of the Earth. Well lets take a look at that shall we.

So lets see after 'The Flood' (insert evil music here) you have Noah and his clan as the only survivors and they have to repopulate the Earth.  So you have four pairs of breeders. We will include Noah and his wife even though the Bible only says they only had three kids I figured I would give the repopulation effort its best chance.  So in the same vain I will increase the life spans out to 200 years as Creationists say people lived longer way back then and just to be nice I suspend the effects of the 'Fall from Grace' so there is no disease, cancer or the possibility of famine or other natural calamities.  By the way the simulation used actual ages and life spans given for the Noah clan as in the Bible.

Now on to female reproduction which will start at maturity, age 13, and continue along until menopause sets in at 110. Remember people will be living to 200 years. Next we will use standard gestation for people, 39 weeks with a minimal 6 week recovery period between pregnancies.  Women will have a 30% chance of getting pregnant every time they have sex regardless of age.  Of course there will be no deaths by child birth and 0 infant and child mortality. And of course lets not forget twins 2% of the time.

In regards to normal deaths we will just extrapolate to the 200 year life spans from the best case we have which is today in a first world country.

Next lets choose a point at which to check on the re population progress of Noah and the gang. How about the building of the Great Pyramids. Yes I know real science has them built before 'The Flood' (insert evil music here) but for the sake of argument lets use one of the accepted Young Earth Creationist dates, two hundred years post flood.

Now we run the simulation several times and take the averages and the results after 200 years are:

Boys (under 12) : 850130
Girls (under 12) : 997946
Men (13-130) : 214198
Women (13-130) : 251641
Elderly (132+) : 5

Total Population : 2313920  

Notice that children under 12 make up about 80% of the population and another interesting thing is that when you analyze the numbers is that  practically every woman over the age of 15 is nursing two children while being pregnant. Not to mention that they are also looking after an average of eight other children at the same time. 

But at least we have in excess of the 20,000 men known to have been used to build the Great Pyramids even if most of then are under the age of 16 years old.

Oh no, oh dear, Oh wait!! 

That is not right at all. I completely forgot about the Tower of Babel debacle (insert more scarey music here).  As a result of this the post flood population was divided into, at least by creationist research, 76 different social and linguistic groups. So lets see then 214198 men divided among 76 societies is 2818 men for each society most of which are children under 16 years of age.

Well there you have it. At the time the Great Pyramids, while giving every advantage to the Noah clan, there were only about 2818 males in total in all of Egypt to build them. So where did the rest of the 20,000 men come from to build the pyramids not to mention the men that are required to run the Egyptian civilization to support them.",1461508827,17,2016-04-24 10:40:27
455,Argument for ID?,1,True,"**From someone else (likely an ID proponent):**


> I once debated a phd biologist on reddit and pointed out his use of a genetic fallacy.  He responded ""I've never heard of the genetic fallacy but it sounds like yet another creationist argument.""  He was dead serious--I kid you not.

> My point is we're dealing here with the philosophical question as to when it's valid to infer design.  Biology certainly informs with useful data, but it's ultimately decided through philosophy.  Suppose we received a radio signal from alpha centauri that alternated between the digits of pi and the fibonnachi sequences exactly every 3600 seconds.  We then ruled out every known possible natural cause as an explanation.  Does it make sense to then conclude an unknown natural cause creates the signal (naturalism-of-the-gaps), or should we conclude that intelligent aliens are the best explanation?

> From reading your other comments you seem to be under the mistaken idea that abiogenesis is likely and that evolutionary processes can account (or are likely to account) for the increasing complexity and diversification of life from there.  In brief response:

> 1.  On abiogensis:  There is an enormous complexity gap between the simplest 1000+ gene free-living organisms, and everything simpler (obligate inter-cellular parasites, viruses, prions).  If there were a gradual path from chemical reactions to cells we should expect this range to be filled with simpler, free-living replicators.  It's not and all our attempts to reductively engineer simpler cells hits a complexity wall beyond which they require increasing levels of life support to survive.  You can posit as-yet-unknown scenarios, but that's no different than assuming a natural cause for our hourly pi-fibonnacci broadcast.

> 2.  Evolution is too slow.  It takes a trillion malaria to evolve resistance to the drugs pyrimethamine and adovaquone, through paths of 1-4 point mutations.  It takes 10^20 of them to evolve resistance to the durg chloroquine thorugh a path of 4 to 10 point mutations.  This huge mutational search for trivial gains is seen across all microbes.  If that weren't the case we'd hear about it instead of how it takes nearly a trillion e coli just to duplicate their existing citrate gene a few times next to a new promoter.  Given this, how can something as mundate as mammal evolution be explained, where selection is far weaker than microbes?  There would've been less than a trillion of us since a chimp divergence, and less than 10^20 mammals ever existing in 200m years since the original radiation.  This benchmark is not to conflated with the evolutionary processes of allele shuffling and loss.  Those can bring about phenotypic change very rapidly but cannot account for the large differences in genetic information separating clades.

> 3.  Adding to #2, all population genetics simulations that use realistic parameters show fitness declining in mammals even under strong purifying selection.  Deleterious mutations arrive faster than selection can remove them, leading to specific sequences being replaced with random noise until the population goes extinct.  What selection can't maintain it certainly can't create.

457,Intelligent Design: Quick Tutorial and AMA,1,True,"# What is ""Intelligent Design"" (ID) Theory?

ID is a generalization of multitudes of observations in nature. As such, I prefer to refer to it as a Law (since that is what a Law is), rather than a Theory. Here is the generalization of the observations:

### In all cases, whenever a phenomenon satisfies three criteria:
### * Contingency;
### * Specification;
### * Complexity,
### and the phenomenon's cause is known, we **observe** that the cause is an intelligence. No contradictions to this cause-effect relationship have ever been documented.

## The three Criteria

Let's examine the three criteria.

### Contingency

Contingency is a term unfamiliar to many, so I will take a moment to explain it.

The opposite of ""contingency"" is ""necessity"", and it helps me, as well as as many others, to grasp the concept. If a relationship phenomenon exhibits necessity, it means that the cause-effect relationship is ""necessitated"" by the physics of the cause and its effect. For example, if I take a double-headed coin and flip it 100 times, I will observe (to no one's surprise) that the coin comes up heads all 100 times. This is because the phenomenon exhibits 100% necessity and 0% contingency (we could account for the outside chance that the coin will land on edge and say it exhibits 99.99999% necessity and 0.00001% contingency, but you get the idea).

There are many phenomena in nature that exhibit contingency: the distribution of gas molecules in a container, the ""ticks"" of a Geiger counter (the overall *rate* of the ticks is necessitated, but their distibution is contingent), the weathering of a rock.

We humans have invented objects whose sole purpose is to function as a medium exhibiting contingency: papyrus and ink, clay cylinders, blackboards/whiteboards, books, and flash drives, to name a few.

You can see that we might say that ""contingent"" is the same as ""random"", and that would be true, were it not for the next criterion.

### Specification

Specification speaks of an intended or observed relationship between the cause and an effect, one which is **unrelated** as far as physics is concerned. An example would be the distribution of ink on a paper that maps the outline of Florida. You could study the physics of paper and ink forever, and never discover a physical influence that causes the ink to organize such that it displays a representation of Florida's coastline.

Note that, just as contingency may not be 100%, so specification may also be less than perfect. The aforementioned Florida map may be weathered and torn, it may be out of date, it may include erroneous, random or unrelated information (such as a note scribbled on it to remember a telephone number), or it may have been drawn by a child or a dyslexic. Therefore, we refer to the *correlation* that exists between the object (the map of Florida) and its referent (the actual coastline of Florida). This correlation can be expressed in the measure of information called the ""bit"" (**bi**nary dig**it**).

### Complexity

Complexity establishes a threshold on the specification's correlation that must be achieved in order to invoke this ID law. There is a direct relationship between the amount of correlation and its likelihood (probability) of occurring by chance alone. For example, a single bit of correlation means that there was a 50/50 chance that the correlation was real and not simply chance. A single bit of correlation is hardly ever of any value. Ten bits implies that there is only 0.1% chance that the correlation was mere chance, which may be a significant amount of correlation. Each extra bit of correlation halves the likelihood that it is by chance, so the likelihood drops precipitously as bits are added.

So there you have it. If a phenomenon exhibits contingency (freedom from necessity), and then exhibits specificity by possessing a correlation to an *independent* set of data, and that correlation is strong enough to rule out chance, the phenomenon can be confidently attributed to an intelligence. And this turns out to be true every time it can be independently verified (that is, the real cause is known).

Some topics I have not discussed, and which may be discussed in further remarks:

### Intelligent Design's Application to Other Disciplines

Archaeology, CSI, cryptography, SETI

### False Negative and False Positive Results

False negatives can occur, but not false positives.

### The ""Universal Probability Bound"" Concept

If a phenomenon exhibits 500 or more bits of correlation, an intelligent cause is certain.

Another argument for evolution is based on Charles Darwin's observation of micro-evolution, piecemeal physical adaptations within a species that develop over time, such as the lengthening of a Tortoise's neck to reach high-growing vegetation, or changes in the shape of a Finch's beak to specialize in eating various foods.

Darwin postulated that if small changes can occur within a species over hundreds or thousands of years, perhaps over tens of thousands of years a species may adapt, or ""evolve,"" into an entirely different species. To his credit as a great thinker and honest seeker of truth, Darwin admitted his ideas were only a theory that needed much more evidence to confirm it.

He especially stressed the need for evidence of ""transitional"" species, those adapting from one to another at the macro level of evolution. If these ""missing links,"" as they have come to be called, could not be found, then his theory would have to be judged wrong. To this day, no scientist has found confirmable evidence of a species in undeniable transition from one to another.

Creationism is the belief that all life was created by God. Creationism has varying degrees, from the ""Young Earth"" faction that believes in a literal ""6 days of creation"" as described in the Bible, to the more relaxed ""Old Earth"" faction that also believes God did it all, but in His ""divine"" version of 6 days, each of which could be millions of years for all humans can know about His perceptions.

Intelligent Design is a science-based rebuttal to Darwinism that uses modern microbiological evidence to claim that macro-evolution is simply not possible, and does not account for life on Earth. They postulate that life is so incredibly complex at its most basic level, there is no plausible explanation for it to exist other than that at some point an ""intelligent"" entity (they do not specify this entity, but it would be vastly more intelligent than humans) had to consciously and deliberately create life.

Intervention Theory agrees to a large extent with Intelligent Design, using many of the same scientific arguments against Darwinism to disprove evolution. Unlike the IDers, Interventionists put a variety of names to the entities that created life on Earth. Some call them ""aliens,"" other call them ""Extraterrestrial Biological Entities, or EBEs"", and some call them ""Terraformers."" Whatever their name, Interventionists attribute their actions to scientific capacity rather than ""miracles.""

The core belief of Intervention Theory is that these beings brought life to Earth and manipulated it for their own purposes. They seem to have incrementally terraformed and populated the planet into what it is now. About 300,000 years ago, some called ""Anunnaki"" came to live on Earth, and in that process they genetically engineered humans. These alien beings are responsible for the megalithic structures around the world, the impossibly rapid growth and advancement of Sumer, the first recognized ""civilized"" culture, the domestication of plants and animals, and the unexplainable flaws in human DNA. (We have, for example, over 4000 genetic disorders--vastly more than other ""higher"" primates.)

""Science in its ideology sees itself as doing a fearless exploration of the unknown. Most of the time it is a fearful exploration of the almost known.""

- Rupert Sheldrake

Intervention Theory is seldom acknowledged or discussed by its competitors, and when it is discussed, it is ridiculed or dismissed outright. This is because today it stands on a threshold occupied by many other ideas now recognized as ""ahead of their time."" For example, in 1915 a German meteorologist named Alfred Wegener provided overwhelming evidence that Earth's entire surface was composed of giant moveable plates. Wegener had everything to prove his case, anyone could see that he was right, but he couldn't explain how the plates might move, only that they must move in some way. Because he lacked a mechanism for his observations, his peers who were not ready to accept a ""moveable"" or ""unstable"" Earth, were able to dismiss the obvious truth of his arguments. Not until 40 years later did the discovery of ""plate tectonics"" show that Wegener had been right all along. He was long dead by the time a full generation of ""fearful explorers"" had died along with him.

You may think, ""But that was nearly a century ago, we're much better now."" Sadly, time has nothing to do with it. Scientific elites are every bit as arrogant, egotistical, greedy, and petty as ever. In fact, in 1982 those same lamentable character traits led colleagues of chemist Daniel Shechtman to ridicule, dismiss, and even ask for his resignation for ""bringing disgrace"" to his team when he discovered a new type of five-sided crystal that did not conform to the structure that ""everyone knew"" all crystals had to possess. Dr. Shechtman's discovery has since been dubbed quasicrystals, and eventually, after years of stout resistance from his colleagues doing their usual ""fearful exploration of the almost known,"" quasicrystals were fully accepted by the scientific establishment and Daniel Shechtman was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

For Interventionists, what is particularly intriguing about this case is that the same unusual, non-repeating pattern of the quasicrystal is, it turns out, also found in very ancient mosaics, and those which mimic even older patterns.

Interventionists find evidence of ancient knowledge being revealed or discovered in various places around the world, and in each case it is attributed to alien overlords giving the information to local people who could not have discovered it on their own. Some attempt to dismiss this as circumstantial evidence, but so much of is now piled up that even the most ""fearful explorers"" are running out of excuses.

In 1968, Erich Von Daniken famously wrote about evidence of ancient technologies in the world's megalithic structures, which clearly could not have been constructed by ancient people in the ways mainstreamers suggest. As with Alfred Wegener, no one could seriously refute the validity of Von Daniken's arguments. However, also like Wegener, he could not establish a provable mechanism for how aliens from beyond Earth could have traveled here to create those wonders.

This problem was solved in 1976 by Zecharia Sitchin, who provided the required mechanism with his brilliant interpretations of the writings of the ancient Sumerians, in which they spoke freely of ""gods"" from another planet living among them as their lords and masters. Unfortunately, mainstream science can and does dismiss these 4,000 year old writings on stone tablets as ""mythology"" that could not possibly be the actual history the Sumerians portrayed them to be.

Now DNA analysis offers the final, crippling blow to the ""fearful explorers,"" providing irrefutable evidence of this unearthly tampering. Lloyd Pye takes what has previously been put forth by Von Daniken, Sitchin and others, to fill in the last remaining gaps in the story. DNA provides conclusive proof of what the Sumerians wrote 4000 years ago when they said their down-to-earth ""gods"" created humans and domesticated plants and animals in ""a house of fashioning"" to ""give the gods their ease.""

In other words, they genetically engineered the things they needed to make life for themselves as easy as possible on what had to be a distant and no doubt difficult outpost far from their home planet. This is now the core of Intervention Theory, and this is what will ultimately prevail against the three current leaders in the race to identify the truth about origins on our planet.",1460885682,8,2016-04-17 05:34:42
459,Creationists and Abiogenesis,10,True,"So there is a certain trend for some people to regularly visit this sub with either copy/pasta about why Abiogenesis is impossible or variations of the exact same arguments about why Abiogenesis is impossible.

*Examples of creationists opening a new thread for this:*

*[One (just yesterday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4eymc8/stephen_hawkings_evolutionary_bias/),
[Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/450m0a/open_questions_in_biology_biochemistry_and/),
[Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/43fn4g/catch22_chicken_and_egg_problems_in_biology_and/)*

*et cetera*

So I figured I'll write a dumbed down version of how a thread determined to ""disprove"" Abiogenesis should never look like:

 

1. No, big numbers are not scary. As we can see [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010.html), the argument that probabilities are low is not only irrelevant, but the claim mostly assumes things that are wrong. (i.e. they don't take into account that a proto cell could have been much [simpler](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_1.html))

2. No, Abiogenesis did not occur by chance, and the mechanisms involved in the process are not governed by chance as you can read [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_2.html). Biochemistry is a heavily understood scientific discipline.

3. No, the fact that we are not able to tell how the ""first"" life form or cell exactly looked like is not a point for you. The fact that we yet can't tell the whole process required to form life is also not a point for you.
(This is what we call an [argument from incredulity](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html) which basically boils down to:
""Ha ha, you are not able to tell me, from A to Z, how chemical evolution works and occurred, therefore it is impossible or never happened."")

4. No, it's not a good idea to claim that stuff is too complex to have been formed, whether it's proteins, protocells, RNA or DNA. There are [several](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_1.html). [reasons](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB025.html). [why](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB015.html).

5. No, the ToE is not at all dependent on Abiogenesis being proven as you can read [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB090.html). The ToE applies as long as life exists and that is the definition of it.

 

With this, I hope to see a rise in the quality of posts whenever somebody feels like he wants to talk about Abiogenesis. And if that's not enough here is an index to stuff we found out related to abiogenesis:

460,Stephen Hawking's Evolutionary Bias,0,True,"Stephen Hawking is a brilliant, brilliant cosmologist and theoretical physicist; he is considered by many to be the most intelligent man alive. He has overcome incredible challenges to achieve prominence at the highest echelons of academia. One wonders what he might be capable of achieving if he did not have to communicate via an electronic voice box from a body almost totally paralyzed.

Stephen Hawking is also an atheist, and a thoughtful one at that. But as an atheist, and therefore a naturalist, he must find naturalistic explanations for all natural phenomena. That includes first life. He is therefore a thoroughgoing subscriber to the only option: abiogenesis.

But abiogenesis runs into a problem. The simplest life that we have succeeded in discovering or creating, indeed that we are capable of conceiving, is far, far too complex, and therefore improbable, to have occurred spontaneously -- even once in all past time. Therefore, since his atheism is non-negotiable, he finds it necessary to make abiogenesis appear less improbable than research and common sense indicate. Whether he does this consciously or unconsciously, we cannot tell. Here is my evidence, though, that he does it.

In his landmark book ""A Brief History of Time"", Hawking is discussing the Second Law of Thermodynamics (SLoT). He asks the reader to consider a system of gas molecules in a **box**. He correctly analyzes the probabilities of various micro-states and demonstrates that the SLoT is essentially a statement of macro-scale probability, and that the SLoT merely asserts that the thermodynamic process will never proceed from a more probable state to a less probable state.

But in the process of explanation, he makes a misleading statement that is frequently made among evolutionists. In the [highlighted text](http://imgur.com/8RKiS2W), he says, ""The probability of all the gas molecules in our first box being found in one half of the box at a later time is **many millions of millions to one**, but it **can happen**.""

Bear in mind that Hawking wrote this book for the layperson (albeit the intelligent layperson). Three questions:

* What is a layperson going to visualize as the size of the ""box""? I would think that most people would visualize a shoe box. Some might see anything from a file box at the largest, to a jewelry box at the smallest. No one is going to visualize a box as big as a refrigerator or so small a microscope is needed to view it.

* What does the layperson assume is the air pressure inside the box? Without doubt he would expect the gas to be under normal room conditions, also called STP (standard temperature and pressure).

* What is assumed about the size of ""many"" in his phrase ""many millions of millions to one""? I think most laypeople would say that it means dozens, hundreds or thousands. Certainly, it could mean no more than a million -- otherwise it is even bigger that even the two superlatives that follow it. For example, it would be true, but misleading, for me to state, ""There are many hundreds of poor people in the world"". You would immediately object, claiming that I am minimizing the plight of the poor.

Now, let's put this all together. To give Hawking as much benefit of the doubt as possible, let's assume the smallest ""box"", say one milliliter (a typical bottle of eye drops contains 15 ml). Sorry, I can't give any leeway regarding the pressure; all would expect STP. And let's assume, nonsensical as it is, that ""many"" means ""millions"".

We can easily calculate the number of gas particles in the box at STP using unit cancellation (Hawking can do this in his head):

(1 ml) * (1 liter / 1000 ml) * (1 mole / 22.4 liters) * (6.02e23 particles / mole) = 2.6875e19 particles

So, the tiny box contains 26 quintillion, 875 quadrillion particles!

So then, what is the probability that all 26 quintillion particles would happen to be found in the same half of the box? It can be expressed as

P = 1 / 2^(26875000000000000000)

Don't even try to imagine how small this number is!

So, what is my complaint? I'm saying that you don't grossly overestimate a probability, and then say that it can happen! But Hawking does this, I suspect without even thinking of how erroneously he has misstated it, because he is continually convincing himself that abiogenesis *can happen*, and molecule-to-man evolution *can happen*.

No, they can't.

P.S.:

Q: How many particles would there be in the box if the probability P were ""one in a million million million""?

A: A whole 60!

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum):

""Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10^−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around **100 particles/cm^(3)**.""

That's **100 particles/ml** in our best man-made vacuum chambers!",1460751656,50,2016-04-15 16:20:56
461,Cytokinesis of plants,7,True,"Plants have a different cytokinesis than animals. The reason beeing that you can't cut off the cell wall. The solution for their cytokinesis is to seperate the two cells from inside with the phragmoplast wich builds the cell plate etc.

How does this phragmoplast evolve? The phragmoplast only has to exist because of the cell wall. So the cell wall must've come first i assume. With the cell wall the cell can't seperate though because of aforementioned reasons. So cells with cell walls shouldn't be able to do cell division. So they should die out.

Solutions?

- The phragmoplast evolved first. *Why though? There is no reason to and i can imagine the process is more costly, else all organisms would divide by this process.*

- The phragmoplast and cell walls evolved at the same time. *Too random?*

- Cell walls came first but early plants dismantled the cell wall first, then seperated like animals, then build cell walls again. Someday the phragmoplast evolved wich was more efficent and these plants ""won"" over other plants.

463,"It's sad that Creation threads are universally downvoted and Evolution threads are universally upvoted. Boy, I guess Evolution must be true! Debate over; close down the site.",5,True,"I'm a creationist, and a young-earth creationist at that. I was once an evolutionist. I would love to engage with evolutionists and debate the merits of each side, but I have a fairly significant amount of karma (currently 784) and over two years on Reddit, and what I see from [my initial post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4elmvc/comments_by_a_creationist_on_the_definitions_of/), plus posts by others, is that pro-evolution posts are upvoted, and pro-creation posts are downvoted.

464,"Comments by a Creationist on the Definitions of ""Evolution"" , ""Micro Evolution"" and ""Macro Evolution""",0,True,"In the [Definitions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1nasgb/definitions/), ""Evolution"" is defined as:

> The change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.

Much obfuscation and confusion is introduced via the definition of this term. As a creationist, I can say that all (informed) creationists agree that this kind of evolution does indeed occur, and constitutes no stumbling block for any interpretation of Genesis. Debate ended. Evolution is simply small changes over time, as opposed to, say, revolution. The real issue arises when this term is used as a substitute for ""Common Descent"", which is a *non sequitur* from simple evolution as defined above. I, as a computer design engineer who has applied Information and Probability Theories in my daily work, see Intelligent Design (ID) Theory as a logical inference, and one which militates against Common Descent.

> Micro Evolution: changes that occur below the taxonomic level of ""Species"".

> Macro Evolution: changes that occur AT or ABOVE the taxonomic level of ""Species"".

First, realize that the Bible doesn't address the term ""species"", but rather uses the term ""kind"" (**מִין** ""min"" in Hebrew). The term ""species"" is a bit nebulous (yes, I know that ""kind"" is even more nebulous!), but most taxonomists define a species boundary as the point at which fertile cross-breeding can no longer occur (thus, all domestic dogs, plus many wild dogs, are the same species). I prefer a slightly different pair of definitions:

> Micro Evolution: changes that occur as a result of Mendelian recombination.

> Macro Evolution: changes that occur as a result of mutations.

Note that in an effort to defend Common Descent Evolution, evolutionists frequently put up examples of Micro-Evolution (peppered moth, Darwin's finches), which can never drive Common Descent Evolution. And Lenski's [Long-Term Evolution Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) is a stunning demonstration of the inability of mutations to drive upward change (If you're unfamiliar with this experiment: Lenski's *e. coli* took over 30,000 generations to drive a two-step mutation sequence to **break** a genetic switch that prevented metabolization of citrate in aerobic conditions, which of course constitutes **de**volution, not **e**volution).

467,The Fabulous Creation - An Alternative to the Jewish Creation Theory,0,True,"In the beginning God created men in his own image and likeness, and they were all gay, for God was a gay man who wore muscle shirts, nut hugger shorts and spoke with a mighty lisp. The men were happy and they were gay, The Lord looked down on his men being all gay and jolly and thought all was good. God created men and they were manly and gay, happy, peaceful, no wars, no pain, no suffering and no fear. And above all no women for women weren't invented, with their soul sucking nagging and preaching and their emotions and their periods and their menopauses and their illogicalness and how they torture and toy with men's feelings and emotions.

God created men, god did not create gods. Men were created in God's own image and likeness but they weren't immortal nor omnipotent. Men were susceptible to the elements. They age and grow weak and tired, they get sick or injured and die off. They are susceptible to death by falling. The Great shopping kart down Mt. Everest incident took many lives as many many men attempted it. God looked down with dismay knowing that he must act soon, as sweet and as manly as things were. Men were not reproducing.

The Lord needed a replacement mechanism and so he created women and their role was just for procreation, to create more men, women were created, nothing more and nothing less. Women were created from the carcasses of dead men, the Great shopping kart down Mt. Everest incident provided many suitable bodies to be made into women. Some women though, suffering from penis-envy, started hating men and becoming lesbians in direct violation of the role God bestowed on them, i.e. producing men such that gay men can be continue to prosper. This angered God very much, and God punished women by making them weak and feeble.

Men soon forgot why god created them, i.e. to be gay, and started pursuing women instead, leading to jealousy, envy, hatred, war, disease and destruction. This angered The Lord very much women soon began producing more women in addition to men, and ever since men knew nothing but pain and suffering and yet instead of fighting the true enemy and fulfilling god's will for them, that's to be gay, through religion women brainwashed men to be their servants under the guise of being married.

Through religion, women and many feeble minded men, made the natural order of men being gay unnatural, and the unnatural, i.e. the gross mixing of the sexes beyond the purpose of producing more men, as natural. Women controlled all levels of society through feeble men. Men were the facade, and men were made to believe they were in control, when in fact women were controlling men like sock puppets.

470,"A question I've had for a while now: What if neither creationism nor evolution nor any of their variants (I.e. Intelligent design, created evolution theories, etc.) were the answer?",5,True,"After growing up in a religious community that strictly adhered to the idea that the Earth was 6000 years old, I learned many of the holes (both illogical and even the few logical ones) to evolution. After finally going to a public school I began to learn about the great deal of evidence supporting the theory of Evolution. For a long time, I believed evolution was the answer to how things are as they are. As time went on though, I began to question it, due to the few logical holes that exist within evolution, that I've seen brought up on this subreddit.

I looked up alternatives to both. All that I've seen seem to be variations or combinations of both theories. Even aliens would still be evidence of one of these two theories. The only alternative I found that actually seemed to be an alternative was morphic resonance, which seems a little out there to say the least, but the person who put fourth this theory said that creationism and evolution are just ideas we have slumped into as humans.

What if, we have spent so much time debating these two ideas, seeking evidence that confirmed these two theories, that we didn't even consider alternatives. At this point we've become so ingrained that you have to either believe this way or that way, and we've only sought out the evidence that supported these two ideas, and all of our inferences from findings are centered around one of these two ideas when science was actually showing something else but we were conditioned to believe in one of these two ideas that we couldn't make completely open minded inferences. 

How long would it take for science to propose an alternative and find evidence for an alternative? Is it not possible that this would have hindered us in our understanding of the universe? Even now most of you reading this would think this sounds crazy, I even think it sounds partly crazy, but I also believe all people are inherently capable of rational thought, but because of the holes in evolution (even the strongest believers in evolution know that there is at least one hole (the lack of any transitional fossil) that science can't fully explain (possibly yet but maybe never) and in the best attempts to explain this hole, leaps are made without evidence directly observable evidence) it keeps people from being able to just jump on board with it and makes it so, from their point of view, their ideas are more plausible (although the evidence with creation is very faulty to say the least, written testimony handed down through thousands of years (assuming this is what really happened which is somewhat plausible) could be considered a type of evidence). 

Isn't it possible that the solution to the debate is to come up with a better theory based on science, that might even address the few flaws that seem (from my perspective: how do we know our inferences from data are correct, other variables effecting outcomes of studies, scientists that have lied on paper, not all results are published, especially if they offer contradicting evidence to previous landmark studies, statistical significance is still found in the natural sciences) to exist within the modern scientific method itself? Would we as a species even know where to begin at this point?

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2316-where-do-complex-organisms-come-from

let’s look at some of the expectations of the natural selection-based modern synthesis: (i) the largest differences within given categories of multicellular organisms, the animals or plants, for example, should have appeared gradually, only after exceptionally long periods of evolution; (ii) the extensive genetic changes required to generate such large differences over such vast times would have virtually erased any similarity between the sets of genes coordinating development in the different types of organism; and (iii) evolution of body types and organs should continue indefinitely. Since genetic mutation never ceases, novel organismal forms should constantly be appearing.


All these predictions of the standard model have proved to be incorrect. The actual state of affairs however, are expected outcomes of the “physico-genetic” picture outlined above. Briefly, we now know that complex multicellular organisms appeared rapidly.",1456661708,4,2016-02-28 07:15:08

In ID, which we are told is not in anyway part of religion but is science, you do not have an ID god you just have a hyper intelligent designer intelligence that is external to the universe that designs and creates everything.

So if you have a Christian that supports ID then you have to accept both a god and a designer intelligence that both reside external to the universe and create everything. However, since ID is not related to religion then they are not the same entity they are totally separate.

So which is more intelligent the hyper intelligent god that creates everything or the hyper intelligent entity that designs and creates everything?

The argument of the mind of all matter in the universe
1. “The ultimate cause of atheism, Newton asserted, is ‘the notion of bodies having, as it were, a complete, absolute and independent reality in themselves.’”
2. The 1925 discovery of quantum mechanics solved the problem of the Universe’s nature. Bright physicists were again led to believe what is for atheists the unbelievable — that the Universe is mental.
3. According to Sir James Jeans an astronomer, mathematician and physicists of Princeton University: “the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter…we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.”
4. Matter cannot produce mind but rather a thoughtful mind can produce structures of matter. If we leave all the molecules or atoms of the brain on a pile under Mother Nature’s sky no brain or mind will ever be produced by thunderbolts, high pressures or typhoons. But a person with a mind can create e.g. a computer.
5. This means mind pre-existed to matter.
6. A mind is a property of a person and the mind of the universe can only be God’s.
7. God exists.


–  Max Planck, theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918
“I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.”  
Eugene Wigner, theoretical physicist and mathematician. He received a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963
“It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.”


what about R.C. Henry,  Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University ,  “The Mental Universe” ; Nature 436:29,2005) ?  He wrote:
“A fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a “mental” construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: “The stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter. Get over it, and accept the inarguable conclusion. The universe is immaterial-mental and spiritual.” 



Newton called light “particles”, knowing the concept to be an ‘effective theory’ — useful, not true. As noted by Newton’s biographer Richard Westfall:
“The ultimate cause of atheism, Newton asserted, is ‘this notion of bodies having, as it were, a complete, absolute and independent reality in themselves.’” Newton knew of Newton’s rings and was untroubled by what is shallowly called ‘wave/particle duality’.

When methodological naturalism is applied, the only explanation for the origin of life is abiogenesis, and of biodiversity, Darwins Theory of evolution. Proponents repeat like a mantra : Evolution is a fact. If that were the case, there would exist far more convincing , clear scientific answers to  almost all relevant scientific questions and issues. This is far from being the case. Based on scientific papers, quite a different picture arises. Instead of compelling answers, questionmarks and lack of understanding, generalized ignorance in regard of almost all relevant issues,  and conceptual problems are the most common. Since the information is widely sparse and scattered amongst thousands of scientific papers, its not so evident that this is the factual state of matter. The general public is duped by effect slogans, that give the false impression of certainty of naturalism. The standard answer, when proponents of naturalism are confronted with this situation, is: ""We are working on it"". Or: ""We don't know yet"". As if naturalism would be the answer in the future, no matter what. Aren't these not a prima facie of  "" evolution of the gaps"" arguments ? The question is: If a certain line of reasoning  is not persuasive or convincing, or only leads to dead ends, then why do proponents of materialism not change their mind because of it? The more scientific papers are published, the less likely the scenario of evolution  and abiogenesis and cosmic evolution becomes. The gaps are NOT being closed. They widen more and more. Some evolutionary predictions have even been falsified. We should consider the fact that modern biology may have reached its limits on several key issues and subjects. All discussions on principal theories and experiments in the field either end in vague suppositions and guesswork, statements of blind faith, made up scenarios,  or in a confession of ignorance.  Fact is  there remains a huge gulf in our understanding… This lack of understanding is not just ignorance about some secondary details; it is a big conceptual gap.  The reach of the end of the road is evident in the matter of almost all major questions. The major questions of evolutionary novelties and abiogenesis  are very far from being clearly formulated, even understood,  and nowhere near being solved, and for most, there is no solution at all at sight. But proponents of evolution firmly believe, one day a solution will be found. It doesn't take a couple of month, and a new scientific paper with wild speculations about abiogenesis is published, and eagerly swallowed by the anscious public, that finally wants its preferred world view being confirmed.  We don't know yet, therefore evolution and abiogenesis ? That way, the design hypothesis remains out of the equation in the beginning, and out at the end, and never receives a serious and honest consideration. If the scientific evidence does not provide satisfactory explanations through naturalism, why should we not change your minds and look somewhere else ?  I see only one reason : there is a emotional commitment to naturalism. Reason is not on the side of the materialist. The believer in creation imho has good reasons to hold his world view. Reason is on his side. The evidence points massive in that direction. There is certainly the oponent just right on the corner, eagerly waiting to claim "" argument of ignorance "".

In Joseph Heller’s classic novel about World War II,Catch-22, an aviator could be excused from combat duty for being crazy. But a rule specified that he first had to request an excuse, and anyone who requested an excuse from combat duty was obviously not crazy, so such requests were invariably denied. The rule that made it impossible to be excused from combat duty was called “Catch-22.”



The nitrogen cicle, irreducible interdependence, and the origin of life 15

Without cyanobacteria - no fixed nitrogen is available. Without fixed nitrogen, no DNA, no amino-acids, no protein can be synthesised. Without DNA, no amino-acids,protein, or cyanobacteria are possible. So there you have a interdependent cycle, with no beginning. But, wait : there is more : cyanobacteria are facultative anaerobes - meaning that they can respire either aerobically or anaerobically. The complexity of two respiratory cycles is very high: the Krebs cycle alone requiring about 12 enzymes, and the anaerobic requiring somewhat fewer, say 8.  So in order for the cyanobacteria to survive, about 40 enzymes are already involved - none of which can be made without fixed nitrogen. So here we have a chicken-egg problem par excellence , which came first..... ??

Oxygen and life have a catch 22 relationship 3

Catch 22 is a situation in which an action has consequences which make impossible to pursue that action. Oxygen is very harmful to life. At the same time oxygen is needed to provide the ozone layer which protects life from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) coming from the sun. If Cyanobacteria came before oxygen, because it is the cause of oxygen, then Cyanobacteria would have had to develop several forms of protection to mitigate the damage from UVR: avoidance, scavenging, screening, repair, and programmed cell death. However, UVR damage is immediate and the time needed to “evolve” protection against it via natural selection, incredibly slow. So, UVR damage would occur before any such defense mechanisms could evolve. Both the transcription and translation systems depend upon numerous proteins, many of which are jointly necessary for protein synthesis to occur at all. Yet all of these proteins are made by this very process. Proteins involved in transcription such as RNA polymerases, for example, are built from instructions carried on an RNA transcript. Translation of the RNA transcript depends upon other specialized enzymes such as synthetases, yet the information to build these enzymes is translated during the translation process that synthetases themselves facilitate.
 Biochemist David Goodsell describes the problem, ""The key molecular process that makes modern life possible is protein synthesis, since proteins are used in nearly every aspect of living. The synthesis of proteins requires a tightly integrated sequence of reactions, most of which are themselves performed by proteins."" Or as Jacques Monod noted in 1971: ""The code is meaningless unless translated. The modern cell's translating machinery consists of at least fifty macromolecular components which are themselves coded in DNA: the code cannot be translated otherwise than by products of translation."" (Scientists now know that translation actually requires more than a hundred proteins.)
The integrated complexity of the cell's information-processing system has prompted some profound reflection. As Lewontin asks, ""What makes the proteins that are necessary to make the protein?"" As David Goodsell puts it, this ""is one of the unanswered riddles of biochemistry: which came first, proteins or protein synthesis? If proteins are needed to make proteins, how did the whole thing get started?"" The end result of protein synthesis is required before it can begin.

The Interdependency of Lipid Membranes and Membrane Proteins 16

The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. The interdependency of lipid membranes and membrane proteins suggests that lipid bilayers and membrane proteins co-evolved together with membrane bioenergetics.
The nonsense of this assertion is evident. How could the membrane proteins co-evolve, if they had to be manufactured in the machinery , protected by the cell membrane ? 
The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer.  The ER and Golgi apparatus together constitute the endomembrane compartment in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The endomembrane compartment is a major site of lipid synthesis, and the ER is where not only lipids are synthesized, but membrane-bound proteins and secretory proteins are also made. 

So in order to make cell membranes, the Endoplasmic Recticulum is required. But also the Golgi Apparatus, the peroxysome, and the mitochondria. But these only function, if protected and encapsulated in the cell membrane. What came first, the cell membrane, or the endoplasmic recticulum ? This is one of many other catch22 situations in the cell, which indicate that the cell could not emerge in a stepwise gradual manner, as proponents of natural mechanisms want to make us believe.

Not only is the cell membrane intricate and complex (and certainly not random), but it has tuning parameters such as the degree to which the phospholipid tails are saturated. It is another example of a sophisticated biological design about which evolutionists can only speculate. Random mutations must have luckily assembled molecular mechanisms which sense environmental challenges and respond to them by altering the phospholipid population in the membrane in just the right way. Such designs are tremendously helpful so of course they would have been preserved by natural selection. It is yet another example of how silly evolutionary theory is in light of scientific facts.

The DNA - Enzyme System is Irreducibly Complex 9 

An often undiscussed aspect of complexity is how the tRNA get assigned to the right amino acids. For the DNA language to be translated properly, each tRNA codon must be attached to the correct amino acid. If this crucial step in DNA replication is not functional, then the language of DNA breaks down. Special enzymes called aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) ensure that the proper amino acid is attached to a tRNA with the correct codon through a chemical reaction called ""aminoacylation."" Accurate translation requires not only that each tRNA be assigned the correct amino acid, but also that it not be aminoacylated by any of the aaRS molecules for the other 19 amino acids. One biochemistry textbook notes that because all aaRSs catalyze similar reactions upon various similar tRNA molecules, it was thought they ""evolved from an common ancestor and should therefore be structurally related."" (Voet and Voet pg. 971-975) However, this was not the case as the, ""aaRSs form a diverse group of [over 100] enzymes … and there is little sequence similarity among synthetases specific for different amino acids."" (Voet and Voet pg. 971-975) Amazingly, these aaRSs themselves are coded for by the DNA: this forms the essence of a chicken-egg problem. The enzymes themselves build help perform the very task which constructs them!

Which came first, glycolysis to make energy or energy from glycolysis needed to make enzymes? Without the enzymes, glycolysis could not occur to produce ATP. But without the ATP those enzymes could not be manufactured. 10

A Simpler Origin for Life 11

DNA replication cannot proceed without the assistance of a number of proteins--members of a family of large molecules that are chemically very different from DNA. Proteins, like DNA, are constructed by linking subunits, amino acids in this case, together to form a long chain. Cells employ twenty of these building blocks in the proteins that they make, affording a variety of products capable of performing many different tasks--proteins are the handymen of the living cell. Their most famous subclass, the enzymes, act as expeditors, speeding up chemical processes that would otherwise take place too slowly to be of use to life. The above account brings to mind the old riddle: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? DNA holds the recipe for protein construction. Yet that information cannot be retrieved or copied without the assistance of proteins. Which large molecule, then, appeared first in getting life started--proteins (the chicken) or DNA (the egg)?


mRNA is needed to make the nuclear pore complex. But without the nuclear pore complex, mRNA cannot be prepared for translation in the Ribosome. Thats a catch22 situation....1

Chicken and Egg 2

Yarus's model also raises a significant chicken-and-egg paradox. Meyer and Nelson explain: Because those biosynthetic pathways involve many enzymes, extant cells would require a pre-existing translation system in order to make them. Since attempts to explain the origin of the genetic code are also attempts to explain the origin of the translation system (indeed, there can be no translation without a code), Yarus et al.'s findings raise an acute chicken and egg problem. Which came first, the aptamer-amino acid affinities that Yarus et al. propose as the basis of the code and translation system, or the translation system that would have been necessary to produce those amino acids (and, thus aptamer-amino acid affinities) in the first place?

A new chicken-and-egg paradox relating to the origin of life 12

Cells could not have evolved without viruses, as they need reverse transcriptase (which is found only in viruses) in order to move from RNA to DNA. In other words, instead of helping to solve the problem of the origin of life on Earth, recent research has only served to highlight one of its central paradoxes. And yet the science media reports the latest discoveries as if the solution is just around the corner. Don’t you find that just a little strange? “In order to move from RNA to DNA, you need an enzyme called reverse transcriptase,” Dolja said. “It’s only found in viruses like HIV, not in cells. So how could cells begin to use DNA without the help of a virus?” 13

Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:

A specific cellular tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS
Complementary DNA then binds to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the 5’ end of the RNA which removes the U5 and R region
The primer then ‘jumps’ to the 3’ end of the viral genome and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA
The first strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) is extended and the majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H
Once the strand is completed, second strand synthesis is initiated from the viral RNA
There is then another ‘jump’ where the PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand
Both strands are extended further and can be incorporated into the hosts genome by the enzyme integrase

Proteins are required to make proteins 14

The threat of autodestruction stems from the circular nature of protein synthesis. Proteins constitute many components of the cell's protein manufacturing machinery. In other words, the cell uses proteins to make proteins. So, if the protein manufacturing machinery were assembled with defective parts, the cell would fail to accurately manufacture proteins. Such a manufacturing failure would cause protein production systems to become increasingly error-prone with each successive round of protein synthesis. Protein manufacturing systems made up of defective components would be more likely to produce defective proteins. This chain reaction would cascade out of control and quite quickly lead to the cells self-destruction.  Effective quality assurance procedures must be in place for protein production or life would not be possible. 

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity

The process of DNA replication depends on many separate protein catalysts to unwind, stabilize, copy, edit, and rewind the original DNA message. In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication involves more than thirty specialized proteins to perform tasks necessary for building and accurately copying the genetic molecule. These specialized proteins include DNA polymerases, primases, helicases, topoisomerases, DNA-binding proteins, DNA ligases, and editing enzymes.38 DNA needs these proteins to copy the genetic information contained in DNA. But the proteins that copy the genetic information in DNA are themselves built from that information. This again poses what is, at the very least, a curiosity: the production of proteins requires DNA, but the production of DNA requires proteins.

“The ‘Catch-22’ of the origin of life is this: DNA can replicate, but it needs enzymes in order to catalyse the process. Proteins can catalyse DNA formation, but they need DNA to specify the correct sequence of amino acids.”  Indeed, the origin of the genetic code is a vicious circle: protein machines are needed to read the DNA, but these protein machines are themselves encoded on the DNA. Furthermore, they use energy, which requires ATP, made by the nano-motor ATP synthase. Yet this is encoded on the DNA, decoded by machines needing ATP. The proteins are the machinery, and the DNA is the reproductive material, yet both are needed at the same time for the cell to function at all. And of course, this would be useless without any information to reproduce .

Nar1 is both a target and a component of the cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis machinery creating an interesting “chicken and egg” situation for its maturation process (Balk et al., 2004). 5

How on earth could proofreading enzymes emerge, especially with this degree of fidelity, when they depend on the very information that they are designed to protect?  Think about it.  This is a catch-22 for Darwinists.  6

RNA synthesis requires RNA repair enzymes 7

A cell has a great investment in its RNAs – they are working copies of its genomic information.  The study of mRNA biogenesis in the last few years has revealed an elaborate surveillance mechanism involving factors such as the UPF proteins that culls aberrantly spliced mRNAs and mRNAs with premature termination codons.  There might be a hint that such RNA quality control mechanisms go awry in cancers, just as DNA quality control mechanisms do, where aberrantly spliced transcripts accumulate in a tumor.  Now that the gates are open, we may have a flood of studies on the RNome [the RNA genome] stability and cancer. 

This aggravates the chicken-and-egg problem for proponents of natural mechanisms.  In the “RNA World” hypothesis for the origin of life, RNA performed both the information storage and enzymatic functions before these roles were outsourced to DNA and proteins.  But how could RNA repair itself?  If RNA needs to be protected from damage, the protein repair system would have needed to be there from the beginning.  Proponents of natural mechanisms might surmise that different primitive RNAs worked side by side to repair each other, but that strains credibility for a hypothesis already far-fetched.
    In typical evolutionary lingo, Begley and Samson blow smoke about what nature produced (emphasis added): “It seems that, for each human protein, parameters have evolved to distinguish between RNA and DNA,” they speculate, and in another place, “It might be that the RNA-demethylation activity of AlkB-like proteins evolved to regulate biological RNA methylation, and that the repair of aberrant, chemical methylation is fortuitous.”  Ask them how the cell evolved these things, and you’ll probably get a quizzical look, as if “Why are you asking such a dumb question?  I don’t know.  It just had to.  We’re here, aren’t we?”

Recombination Vital to Genome Stability  8

The latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (July 17) contains a symposium on gene replication and recombination, among other papers on DNA.  Among the interesting papers:
(1) A theory on how genomes can contain vast stretches of non-coding DNA, apparently inactive retrotransposons that were inserted by recombination, polyploidy or lateral transfer.  These inactive stretches, while harmless, can greatly expand the genome while keeping the number of actual genes relatively constant.  
(2) A description of how recombination is an essential method for repair of DNA breaks, stating that “DNA synthesis is an accurate and very processive phenomenon; nevertheless, replication fork progression on chromosomes can be impeded by DNA lesions, DNA secondary structures, or DNA-bound proteins.  Elements interfering with the progression of replication forks have been reported to induce rearrangements and/or render homologous recombination essential for viability, in all organisms from bacteria to human.”  
(3) Another paper describes how specialized proteins called topoisomerases help prevent the strain of uncoiling DNA from breaking,  but when they fail, recombination can help restart the replication process.  
(4) A paper describes how recombination works to repair breaks in a replicating chromosome.  
(5) Some Japanese scientists describe how a gene codes for a motor protein that is essential for genome stability.
(6) The cover story describes the various repair mechanisms, stating, “Maintenance of genomic integrity and stable transmission of genetic information depend on a number of DNA repair processes.  Failure to faithfully perform these processes can result in genetic alterations and subsequent development of cancer and other genetic diseases.” Describing one such mechanism named Rad52, the authors state, “The key role played by Rad52 in this pathway has been attributed to its ability to seek out and mediate annealing of homologous DNA strands . . . . our data indicate that each Rad52 focus [i.e. active site] represents a center of recombinational repair capable of processing multiple DNA lesions.”


These are just samples of the exciting findings being made about DNA replication.  These and other papers show that it is a fail-safe system with many sophisticated backup and repair mechanisms.  While there is still much to learn, and many mysteries to explain, DNA’s ability to replicate is truly a marvel of engineering.  Think about the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum for evolution illustrated by (5) above: a gene codes for a protein that is essential for the gene to exist.

once Earth had pyrophosphite, it had an energetic molecule that, while not as useful as ATP, was at least somewhat similar.  “The team found that a compound known as pyrophosphite may have been an important energy source for primitive lifeforms.”  Did he have any evidence for this?  No; it’s just a requirement.  “It’s a chicken and egg question,” he said.  “Scientists are in disagreement over what came first – replication, or metabolism.  But there is a third part to the equation – and that is energy.”  So while scientists are disagreeing about two things, why not add a third?  That’s progress: “You need enzymes to make ATP and you need ATP to make enzymes,” explained Dr Kee, as if adding questions qualifies as explaining something: “The question is: where did energy come from before either of these two things existed?”  We may not know the answers, but at least our ignorance is getting more sophisticated thanks to OOL research.

The hardware and software of the cell, evidence of design 18

Paul Davies: the fifth miracle page 62
Due to the organizational structure of systems capable of processing algorithmic (instructional) information, it is not at all clear that a monomolecular system – where a single polymer plays the role of catalyst and informational carrier – is even logically consistent with the organization of information flow in living systems, because there is no possibility of separating information storage from information processing (that being such a distinctive feature of modern life). As such, digital–first systems (as currently posed) represent a rather trivial form of information processing that fails to capture the logical structure of life as we know it. 1

We need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects of life, or the job is only half finished. Explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a solution to life’s origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside a computer. It is this transition where one should expect to see a chemical system literally take-on “a life of its own”, characterized by informational dynamics which become decoupled from the dictates of local chemistry alone (while of course remaining fully consistent with those dictates). Thus the famed chicken-or-egg problem (a solely hardware issue) is not the true sticking point. Rather, the puzzle lies with something fundamentally different, a problem of causal organization having to do with the separation of informational and mechanical aspects into parallel causal narratives. The real challenge of life’s origin is thus to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics.

Software and hardware are irreducible complex and interdependent. There is no reason for information processing machinery to exist without the software, and vice versa.
Systems of interconnected software and hardware are irreducibly complex.

All cellular functions are  irreducibly complex 19

Paul Davies, the fifth miracle page 53: 
Pluck the DNA from a living cell and it would be stranded, unable to carry out its familiar role. Only within the context of a highly specific molecular milieu will a given molecule play its role in life. To function properly, DNA must be part of a large team, with each molecule executing its assigned task alongside the others in a cooperative manner. Acknowledging the interdependability of the component molecules within a living organism immediately presents us with a stark philosophical puzzle. If everything needs everything else, how did the community of molecules ever arise in the first place? Since most large molecules needed for life are produced only by living organisms, and are not found outside the cell, how did they come to exist originally, without the help of a meddling scientist? Could we seriously expect a Miller-Urey type of soup to make them all at once, given the hit-and-miss nature of its chemistry?

Being part of a large team,cooperative manner,interdependability,everything needs everything else, are just other words for irreducibility and interdependence. 

For a nonliving system, questions about irreducible complexity are even more challenging for a totally natural non-design scenario, because natural selection — which is the main mechanism of Darwinian evolution — cannot exist until a system can reproduce. For an origin of life we can think about the minimal complexity that would be required for reproduction and other basic life-functions. Most scientists think this would require hundreds of biomolecular parts, not just the five parts in a simple mousetrap or in my imaginary LMNOP system. And current science has no plausible theories to explain how the minimal complexity required for life (and the beginning of biological natural selection) could have been produced by natural process before the beginning of biological natural selection.

Iron-sulfur clusters 20

Sulfur is an essential element, being a constituent of many proteins and cofactors. Iron-sulfur (FeS) centers are essential protein cofactors in all forms of life.  Various biosynthetic pathways were found to be tightly interconnected through complex crosstalk mechanisms that crucially depend on the bio-availability of the metal ions iron, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, copper, and zinc.  Proteins requiring Fe/S clusters in their active site have been localized in mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus where they are involved in rather diverse functions such as the TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, bacterial and mitochondrial respiration, co-factor biosynthesis, ribosome assembly, regulation of protein translation, DNA replication and DNA repair. Hence the process of iron-sulphur biosynthesis is essential to almost all forms of life. The prevalence of these proteins on the metabolic pathways of most organisms leads some scientists to theorize that iron–sulfur compounds had a significant role in the origin of life in the iron–sulfur world theory. The iron–sulfur world hypothesis is a set of proposals for the origin of life and the early evolution of life advanced in a series of articles between 1988 and 1992 by Günter Wächtershäuser. FeS cluster assembly is a complex process involving the mobilisation of Fe and S atoms from storage sources, their assembly into [Fe-S] form, their transport to specific cellular locations, and their transfer to recipient apoproteins. Nar1 is a essential component of a cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly machinery. Required for maturation of extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins. 12  Thus, Nar1 is both a target and a component of the cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis machinery creating an interesting “chicken and egg” situation for its maturation process Conserved Iron–Sulfur (Fe–S) clusters are found in a growing family of metalloproteins that are implicated in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication and repair.  Therefore, they had to exist prior life began, since DNA replication enzymes and proteins depends on them. They require however also complex proteins and enzymes to be synthesized. Thats a classical chicken/egg problem.

Creationists/ID'ers often point to highly efficient and complex molecular systems such as catalytic protein complexes as evidence for divine design. Or to very specific and beautifully adapted organ structures, like gills or eyes.

However, some of the best examples of these molecular masterpieces of complexity are viruses. Now viruses have the most streamlined of genomes and they are ruthlessly efficient as they can hijack the complex regulation of cells by using just a handful of proteins of their own, and by coupling them with crafty and elegant mechanisms at the molecular level. This is what makes them a perfect example of an organism that is incredibly complex. To whit intelligently designed, right?

But wait, these very same Creationists/ID'ers they also claim that viruses are a result of the 'Fall From Grace', you know where human sin is the causal factor (not the god of Abraham), and the evolution of viruses is apparently micro evolution that doesn't come from the god of Abraham but from a type of evolution they accept.

So did the god of Abraham design these incredibly complex and deadly viruses, or did all this massive complexity just come about from evolution, you know random mutation followed by nature selection, post 'Fall From Grace'?

A review of Paul Davies book, the fifth miracle, about the genetic code. Starting at page 105:

I have described life as a deal struck between nucleic acids and proteins. However, these molecules inhabit very different chemical realms; indeed, they are barely on speaking terms. This is most clearly reflected in the arithmetic of information transfer. The data needed to assemble proteins are stored in DNA using the four-letter alphabet A, G, C, T. On the other hand, proteins are made out of twenty different sorts of amino acids. Obviously twenty into four won’t go. So how do nucleic acids and proteins communicate?
Earthlife has discovered a neat solution to this numerical mismatch by packaging the bases in triplets.

How could earthlife have discoverd a mechanism upon which life depends ? 

Four bases can be arranged in sixty-four different permutations of three, and twenty will go into sixty-four, with some room left over for redundancy and punctuation. The sequence of rungs of the DNA ladder thus determines, three by three, the exact sequence of amino acids in the proteins. To translate from the sixty-four triplets into the twenty amino acids means assigning each triplet (termed a codon) a corresponding amino acid. This assignment is called the genetic code. The idea that life uses a cipher was first suggested in the early 1950s by George Gamow, the same physicist who proposed the modern big-bang theory of the universe. As in all translations, there must be someone, or something, that is bilingual, in this case to turn the coded instructions written in nucleicacid language into a result written in amino-acid language. From what I have explained, it should be apparent that this crucial translation step occurs in living organisms when the appropriate amino acids are attached to the respective molecules of tRNA prior to the protein-assembly process.  This attachment is carried out by a group of clever enzymes  


cleverness is something we do usually assign to someone that is intelligent

that recognize both RNA sequences and the different amino acids, and marry them up accordingly with the right designation. 

The recognition must be PRE-PROGRAMMED. In the same manner, as a translator must learn two languages, in order to be able to assign one written word in english,  for example, to the written symbol in chinese with the same significance. There must be a previous common agreement of meaning before the translation process can begin. As for example, the word  translator, is written 翻譯者 in traditional chinese. Ask someone that does not speak chinese, to translate the word translator  into chinese . He has around 3500 different symbols to chose from. In the "" amino acid language"", there are 20 different amino acids to chose from.  The translator must know both, the word translator in english and in chinese, and know both written alphabets, previous to make the assignment. Only mental processes are able to do this. Chance is simply a impotent cause. 


William Dembsky:
http://www.discovery.org/a/1256
The problem is that nature has too many options and without design couldn’t sort through all those options. The problem is that natural mechanisms are too unspecific to determine any particular outcome. Natural processes could theoretically form a protein, but also compatible with the formation of a plethora of other molecular assemblages, most of which have no biological significance. Nature allows them full freedom of arrangement. Yet it’s precisely that freedom that makes nature unable to account for specified outcomes of small probability.Nature, in this case, rather than being intent on doing only one thing, is open to doing any number of things. Yet when one of those things is a highly improbable specified event, design becomes the more compelling, better  inference. Occam's razor also boils down to an argument from ignorance: in the absence of better information, you use a heuristic to accept one hypothesis over the other.



The genetic code, with a few recently discovered minor variations, is common to all known forms of life. That the code is universal is extremely significant, for it suggests it was used by the common ancestor of all life, and is robust enough to have survived through billions of years of evolution. Without it, the production of proteins would be a hopelessly hit-or-miss affair. Questions abound. How did such a complicated and specific system as the genetic code arise in the first place? Why, out of the 10 possible codes based on triplets, has nature chosen the one in universal use? Could a different code work as well? If there is life on Mars, will it have the same genetic code as Earthlife? Can we imagine uncoded life, in which interdependent molecules deal directly with each other on the basis of their chemical affinities alone? Or is the origin of the genetic code itself (or at least a genetic code) the key to the origin of life? The British biologist John Maynard Smith has described the origin of the code as the most perplexing problem in evolutionary biology. With collaborator Eörs Szathmáry he writes: “The existing translational machinery is at the same time so complex, so universal, and so essential that it is hard to see how it could have come into existence, or how life could have existed without it.” To get some idea of why the code is such an enigma, consider whether there is anything special about the numbers involved. Why does life use twenty amino acids and four nucleotide bases? It would be far simpler to employ, say, sixteen amino acids and package the four bases into doublets rather than triplets. Easier still would be to have just two bases and use a binary code, like a computer. If a simpler system had evolved, it is hard to see how the more complicated triplet code would ever take over. The answer could be a case of “It was a good idea at the time.” A good idea of whom ?  If the code evolved at a very early stage in the history of life, perhaps even during its prebiotic phase, the numbers four and twenty may have been the best way to go for chemical reasons relevant at that stage. Life simply got stuck with these numbers thereafter, their original purpose lost. Or perhaps the use of four and twenty is the optimum way to do it. There is an advantage in life’s employing many varieties of amino acid, because they can be strung together in more ways to offer a wider selection of proteins. But there is also a price: with increasing numbers of amino acids, the risk of translation errors grows. With too many amino acids around, there would be a greater likelihood that the wrong one would be hooked onto the protein chain. So maybe twenty is a good compromise. Do random chemical reactions have knowledge to arrive at a optimal conclusion, or a "" good compromise"" ?  

An even tougher problem concerns the coding assignments—i.e., which triplets code for which amino acids. How did these designations come about? Because nucleic-acid bases and amino acids don’t recognize each other directly, but have to deal via chemical intermediaries, there is no obvious reason why particular triplets should go with particular amino acids. Other translations are conceivable. Coded instructions are a good idea, but the actual code seems to be pretty arbitrary. Perhaps it is simply a frozen accident, a random choice that just locked itself in, with no deeper significance. 

That frozen accident means, that good old luck would have  hit the jackpot  trough trial and error amongst 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes . That is the number of atoms in the whole universe. That puts any real possibility of chance providing the feat out of question. Its , using  Borel's law, in the realm of impossibility.  1

Paul Hayden  The fundamental question is how these regularities of the standard code came into being, considering that there are more than 10 ^ 84 possible alternative code tables if each of the 20 amino acids and the stop signal are to be assigned to at least one codon. More specifically, the question is, what kind of interplay of chemical constraints, historical accidents, and evolutionary forces could have produced the standard amino acid assignment, which displays many remarkable properties.

And how could that make sense ? THINK !! 

On the other hand, there may be some subtle reason why this particular code works best. If one code had the edge over another, reliability-wise, then evolution would favor it

The problem once more is, that evolution could not be in play at this time and stage of affairs, since evolution only works upon replication. Replication depends on the machinery in question. Catch22.... 

, and, by a process of successive refinement, an optimal code would be reached. It seems reasonable.

DOES IT SEEM REASONABLE ? TO ME IT SEEMS UTMOST IRRATIONAL. IRRATIONAL TO THE EXTREME. So did random , unguided, non-intelligent chemicals have a pre-established goal to reach a optimal code? And even if that were the case, what good would it be without the translation machinery, the ribosome, fully set up aind in place, and doing its job ? 

But this theory is not without problems either. Darwinian evolution works in incremental steps, accumulating small advantages over many generations. In the case of the code, this won’t do. Changing even a single assignment would normally prove lethal, because it alters not merely one but a whole set of proteins. Among these are the proteins that activate and facilitate the translation process itself. So a change in the code risks feeding back into the very translation machinery that implements it, leading to a catastrophic feedback of errors that would wreck the whole process. To have accurate translation, the cell must first translate accurately. This conclusion seems paradoxical. A possible resolution has been suggested by Carl Woese. He thinks the code assignments and the translation mechanism evolved together. Initially there was only a rough-and-ready code, and the translation process was very sloppy. At this early stage, which is likely to have involved less than the present complement of twenty amino acids, organisms had to make do with very inefficient enzymes: the highly specific and refined enzymes life uses today had not yet evolved. Obviously some coding assignments would prove better than others, and any organism that employed the least error-prone assignments to code for its most important enzymes would be on to a winner.

Since when does dead matter have the intrinsic desire to get alive, and to win ? 

It would replicate more accurately, and in the process its coding arrangements would predominate among daughter cells. In this context, a “better” coding assignment would mean a robust one, so that, if there was a translation error, the same amino acid would nevertheless be made—i.e., there would be enough ambiguity for the error to make no difference. Or, in case the error did cause a different amino acid to be made, it would be a close cousin of the intended one, and the resulting protein would do the job almost as well. Successive refinements of this process might then lead to the universal code seen today—like a picture gradually coming into focus.

Now THAT was a great lecture of how to do pseudo-science, and assign to chance creative power that it does not have. 

The code may have an altogether deeper explanation. If a table of coding assignments is drawn up, it can be analyzed mathematically to see if there are any hidden patterns. Peter Jarvis and his colleagues at the University of Tasmania claim that the universal code conceals abstract sequences similar to the energy levels of atomic nuclei, and might even involve a subtle property of subatomic particles called supersymmetry. These mathematical correspondences may be purely coincidental, or they may point to some underlying connection between the physics of the molecules involved and the organization of the code. I have subjected the reader to the technicalities of the genetic code to make a general conceptual point that goes right to the heart of the mystery of life. Any coded input is merely a jumble of useless data unless an interpreter or a key is available. A coded message is only as good as the context in which it is put to use. That is to say, it has to mean something. In chapter 2, I drew the distinction between syntactic and semantic information. On their own, genetic data are mere syntax. The striking utility of encoded genetic information stems from the fact that amino acids “understand” it. The information distributed along a strand of DNA is biologically relevant. In computerspeak, genetic data are semantic data. For a clear perspective on this point, consider the way in which the four bases A, G, C, and T are arranged in DNA. As explained, these sequences are like letters in an alphabet, and the letters may spell out, in code, the instructions for making proteins. A different sequence of letters would almost certainly be biologically useless. Only a very tiny fraction of all possible sequences spells out a biologically meaningful message, in the same way that only certain very special sequences of letters and words constitute a meaningful book. Another way of expressing this is to say that genes and proteins require exceedingly high degrees of specificity in their structure. As I stated in my list of properties in chapter 1, living organisms are mysterious not for their complexity per se, but for their tightly specified complexity. To comprehend fully how life arose from nonlife, we need to know not only how biological information was concentrated, but also how biologically useful information came to be specified, given that the milieu from which the first organism emerged was presumably just a random mix of molecular building blocks. In short, how did meaningful information emerge spontaneously from incoherent junk?

I began this section by stressing the dual nature of biomolecules: they can be both hardware— particular three-dimensional forms—and software. The genetic code shows just how important the informational aspect of biomolecules is. The job of explaining the origin of life goes beyond finding a plausible chemical pathway out of a primordial soup. We need to know, conceptually, how mere hardware can give rise to software.

449,The Power of Randomness,6,True,"The Power of Randomness

A while back a creationist, well to be truthful every creationist has at one time or another, made the assertion that random generation cannot ever end up with any form of recognizable information.  To back up this assertion they state that it would be the same as typing a random mess of characters on a keyboard and expecting words to appear.  Then to back up this assertion this particular creationist typed about 60 characters of random gibberish.

Interestingly enough when you actually looked at the string it did in fact contain words. But then you might say that the creationist in question might have typed real words as a result of muscle memory which would of course negate the observed results. So I decided to actually run an experiment that actually used random generated strings and then parse those strings for English words. (You know science)

So I wrote a simulator that generated 60 character random strings and then  I ignoring single character words parsed out all 2 to 10 character sequences in the string and compared them against a dictionary.  The routine was then run 1,000,000 times.  The results included up to 8 character words.

Iterations = 1,000,000

Total Tests = 503,000,000

Word length = 2, count = 7,151,190

Word length = 3, count = 2,674,758

Word length = 4, count = 373,686

Word length = 5, count = 25,679

Word length = 6, count = 1,617

Word length = 7, count = 77

Word length = 8, count = 3

Word length = 9, count = 0

Word length = 10, count = 0

Next I wondered what the results would be in I introduced a delimiter to treat each string as an individual word. So with the 26 letters I included a space as the word delimiter. So I wrote another simple routine to investigate this method of random word generation.  The routine was run 10 million times with the following results. 

Iterations = 10,000,000

Number of Words of Each Length

Word length = 2, count = 47,498

Word length = 3, count = 16,858

Word length = 4, count = 2,359

Word length = 5, count = 163

Word length = 6, count = 14

Word length = 7, count = 0

Word length = 8, count = 0

Word length = 9, count = 0

Word length = 10, count = 0

So as you can plainly see using the example, championed by the creationist, randomness does actually generate recognizable information.

From Marcos Eberlin's excellent book : Life and the Universe by Intelligent Design

https://www.widbook.com/ebook/life-and-the-universe-by-intelligent-design

 ATP synthase motor. The smallest and most efficient power plant on this planet powering the production of energy of Life. One of the essential requirements for Life is energy. Living organisms require large amounts of energy, and the molecule that stores and releases energy of life is adenosine triphosphate represented by the acronym ATP (Figure 2). And then there is a need for a huge amount of this molecule. And to synthesize it with efficiency and optimization, Life requires adenosine - a heterocyclic nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar molecule (one sugar) and three phosphates. Note the difficulty here for any unguided process  you ""want to imagine"" to form such a molecule. Sugars are formed by formaldehyde - essentially - a highly reactive molecule. Sugars are reactive and unstable, and reaction media that allow synthesis of sugars are incompatible with the means of synthesis of nitrogenous bases. Anions phosphate precipitate in the presence of metal ions such as Ca2 +, for example. And links between phosphate anions involve slow reactions, and need to be catalyzed by enzymes. Therefore, this molecule synthesis routes give a hell lot of work that only the machinery of life can perform. And to make matters worse for the task, the ATP molecule is unstable and hydrolyzes easily in water, and is exothermical (gives off heat). And then to establish the third phosphate connection, which requires most energy,  life must go against the kinetics and enthalpy and so uses the only way to overcome such cumber thermodynamic: a machine, and an incredible nanomachine: ATP synthase 

The ATP molecule - a chemical masterpiece- to generate the energy of Life.
The ATP synthase is the name given to a true nanomolecular ""power plant""  made by turbines and protein reactors, that in a spectacular and artfully crafted way, synthesizes - and reverse the synthesis - the molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine bifosfate) and anions of inorganic phosphate in the cells (Figure 1). A nanomolecular marvel of technology, chemistry and mechanical engineering mega intelligent.

 Carved like a work of chemical art , beautiful and awe-inspiring - it appears to challenge failed theories - ATP synthase has the smallest engine known in this universe. And this engine, professional thing, it performs like  a perfect and finely tuned ballet,  a synchronized set of thousands and thousands of inter- and intramolecular interactions. This plant also has input channels and output protons also artfully constructed with extreme skill and sophistication and astonishing precision, and nanometrical distances and forces set and finely calculated for the purpose of building a nanomolecular plant maximized to produce  chemical energy.

With a nanomolecular turbine powered by protons and which transmits its movement through a molecular rotor, and channels that direct the movement of these protons - kind of molecular slides to the water parks, the ATP synthase has fascinated many electrical and  chemical engineers primarily - for its perfection in performing reactions and producing energy. In it, we also have ""molecular pins"" that attach the rotor to the chemical reactor (F1 unit) catalyst, which accommodates within itself the reagents and literally confines them and ""Squeezes"", so as to accelerate the desired chemical reaction. And that tightens and loosens are all promoted by a synchronized spin - one opens and closes nanometrically set - governed by a molecular piece of oval shape crankshaft type in camshafts, those that man added to their combustion engines 
A fantastic chemical reaction then occurs in the ATP synthase: ADP + ATP → PO4-. And the whole machinery of ATP synthase is there fitted perfectly in the cell wall of the inner mitochondrial membrane , that hyper mega high tech "" cell ship"" . And all with homochiral molecules, AA type lefthanded only.

 The ATP synthase is therefore a show of sophistication, specification and aperiodicity, and hyper mega irreducible complexity . Disconnect one of its components, disturb one of its forms, replace some of your AA position, and there are thousands and thousands of them, and the system loses function altogether. Try to build it slowly, step by step, by mindless unguided processes, will it be possible? Viable at the molecular level? Where would the energy come from to build it, if it is the energy provider of life? Remember though that the energy that produces ATP synthase is essential to life, virtually for all forms of life. And it is power required  at the right time at the right flow! The structure of ATP synthase is so ingenious that its elucidation earned a Nobel Prize in 1997, as the enormity and significance of the feat. Our cells contain thousands of these nanomotors embedded in their mitochondria, and installed in their membranes. And these nanomotors - nano power plants - are about 200,000 times smaller than a pinhead. And that nanomotor is there for the sole purpose of forcing the occurrence of a single reaction: the third phosphate bond in ADP ""crushing it"" along with phosphate to form ATP 
The ATP molecules are used in key processes in the cell which require energy, which is released , then regenerating ADP and a free phosphate. The energy produced is directed, for example in humans, for contraction of muscles, beating of the heart and processes in the brain, whereas the reaction products are economically and wisely recycled . In the center of the ATP synthase is a small rotor which rotates around 100 revolutions per second, synthesizing 3 ATP molecules per revolution, or 300 molecules of ATP per second! Only for our thinking and walking, we recycle proportional to our body weight (80 kg) of ATP every day. Each enzyme in the ATP synthase is composed of 31 other proteins that, in turn, are made of thousands of amino acids precisely arranged. Remove any of the 31 proteins and the motor becomes simply useless.
The ATP synthase, along with the Scourge, is one of the most ""striking"" examples of mega irreducible complexity we see around the corner in life. And there's more: all the immense set of genetic information and RNA, plus dozens of proteins needed to build the ATP synthase, are in total even more irreducibly complex than the ATP synthase itself. The car factory is -by principle - more irreducibly complex than the car it manufactures.

Described in more details chemical and biochemical (insane task), the ATP synthase is a protein complex consisting of several proteins that fit perfectly synchronously, and - in a synchronized chemical ballet - in the form of a ""mushroom"". This nano mill is in thousands ""installed"" on the inner membrane of the mitochondria (Figure 6). There are two main components: (1) head - a spherical area comprised by the catalytic portion of the enzyme known as Factor connection 1, or simply F1, which measures about 90 Å in diameter; and (2) basic - called F0 - fixing the whole to the inner membrane of mitochondria. High resolution SEM micrographs revealed that the head (1) and the bottom part (2) are joined by a central rod - formed by subunits F1 and F0 - relatively narrow (45) which is connected to a peripheral button 90-100 Å in diameter. A mitochondria located in human liver cells has about 15,000 copies of ATP synthase

 The most efficient way to conduct a chemical reaction known in this universe, ""the hard way""! In the ATP synthase, a protein complex jointly embraces a ADP difosfate  molecule and one anion phosphate (Pi) providing energy and forcing them ""mechanically"" by reacting . Reaction occurred ""by force"", the engine spins at 8,500 RPM and the protein complex ""opens"" then its arms, by the action of the crankshaft driven by an engine and rotor, and releases the product, the tri-phosphate ATP molecule. The ATP synthase is the smallest rotary engine known today. To give you an idea of its tiny size, in a millimeter, can be grouped, side by side, approximately about 100 000 ATP synthases. This engine is driven not by power, but by ""proton energy""; that is, by a countercurrent flow of protons.
The ATP synthase would then be the headless product of evolution, not guided or inexcusable evidence of intelligent design? Remember that without energy there is no life, and in life there is no power without ATP, and in life there is no ATP without ATP synthase. The ATP synthase is thus more one of the great ""chicken-egg"" dilemmas  of Life! For all biochemical processes that coordinate the functioning and structure need to be supplied ATP synthase molecule itself produces: ATP. About 14 trillion body cells at this point are conducting this biochemical reaction via ATP synthase, in about a million times per minute through mitochondria.
To give you even more ingenius details of this fabulous machine, note that the F1 region of ATP synthase (F1-ATPase) is made up of six protein units, and divided into three pairs of active sites. These units form regions which provide ""chemical hugs"" through a docking site for ADP and phosphate. An anchoring (or stator) is curved on the outside of the structure in order to fix the base (F0) to the head (F1). Three molecules of ATP are formed for each complete shaft rotation. Chemical engineering of ATP synthase is  shown - there's no denying - intelligent and mega efficient . The complex has a spiral shaft, called ""Y"", which is the circumference between F0 and F1 and allows the connection of one region to the other, like a pen within a cardboard tube. The intelligent design of this nanomolecular machine causes the flow of protons, across the membrane, turn the shaft and the base. So it's not turning the base and the axis ""attracts"" the protons, as originally thought, but it is the flow of protons turning the engine. The turning occurs when the central axis (y) puts pressure on the inner walls of the six proteins in the F1 region thus result in a smooth structural deformation with consequent reformation alternately. My vote here for the ""pinnacle"" of chemical engineering in the nanomolecular this universe. Heck, what a  genius mind that knew Chemistry as anyone else, to come up with something like that!

Note further that the F0 subunit, which is fixed on the membrane of mitochondria, rotates clockwise. Laterally annexed the F0, is another input channel subunit which serves as the channel where the protons will be directed to the engine. The rotation is synchronized around its own axis and provides that individually protons enter and exit, respectively. Since the protons are attracted to the input channel, they connect to F0, and follow  nearly a complete rotation, they then are  conveyed to an output channel present on the same side frame attached to where F0 enters. The subunit F1 (F1 ATPase) is that attracts molecules adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (Pi), which are released together with ATP.

3D view at the molecular level of ATP synthase: nano power plant vital to life on this planet.

But there is even more wonder in the ATP synthase: the rotational mechanism used for F0 is performed routinely when there is a high concentration of protons in the cytosol and a low concentration of ATP inside the mitochondria. But when these concentrations are reversed, the enzyme "" understands biochemically"" that its function was successful, and if it continues, will promote serious imbalance in the cell. Control is everything! In this situation, the ATP synthase ""thinks and reacts,"" and and makes its F0 turn now in the opposite direction, and the mechanism is reversed, and the proton exit channel now becomes the input channel, and the  protons inside the organelle return to the cytosol. ATP molecules are now converted to ADP and phosphate free, in a chemical ""retro-reaction"" . A chemical balance nano-mechanically directed and controlled! Since you know this fantastic nanomachine a little better  at the molecular level, , what do you think: chance or design?

457,The reason why the vast majority of people are in support of Evolution and why it is biased,0,True,"[According to the NCSE](http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/many-scientists-see-gods-hand-evolution) (an evolution advocacy group) 55% of scientists are atheists, 40% believe God guided evolution, and 5% are young earth creationists.  The survey had no category for old earth creationists and they don't break it down by field, so  the results aren't perfect.  

I don't like to profile large groups of people I've never met and I think the reasons for evolutionary theory's widespred acceptance are complex and multifaceted.  But I'd guess it involves some of the following:

1.  Many immediately reject creation or ID from the many embarrassingly bad ""why are there still monkeys"" arguments used by laymen.  They assume there's nothing beyond that and never dig deeper to encounter the good arguments.

2.  It's what they were taught in school and they never questioned it.  ""I didn't give it much thought; It wasn't my area of concern"", Michael Behe [reflected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9SmPNQrQHE&feature=youtu.be&t=2m00s) of his postdoc research days.  ""college students have not been shown the weakness of Darwinian evolution"" as Joseph Kuhn [published in 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246854/?report=classic).

3.  Many don't know about issues outside their narrow field.  Paleontologist and ID critic Don Prothero [wrote that](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ptb/6959004.0001.001/--stephen-jay-gould-did-he-bring-paleontology-to-the-high?rgn=main;view=fulltext) ""Nearly all metazoans [meaning animals] show stasis, with almost no good examples of gradual evolution... the prevalence of stasis is a puzzle that has no simple answer"" but lamented, ""by and large the neontological [non-paleontologist] community still 'doesn't get it'... The journal Evolution continues to publish almost no contributions by paleontologists"".  Ironically I've also seen geneticists cite the fossil record as evidence for evolution when genes don't form trees.

4.  Others don't talk about the problems.  Renowned chemist James Tour [describes](http://youtu.be/PZrxTH-UUdI?t=52m3s), ""Let me tell you what goes on in the back rooms of science – with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. I have sat with them, and when I get them alone... I say, ""Do you understand all of this, where all of this came from, and how this happens?"" Every time that I have sat with people who are synthetic chemists, who understand this, they go 'Uh-uh. Nope.' These people are just so far off, on how to believe this stuff came together. I've sat with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. Sometimes I will say, 'Do you understand this?' And if they’re afraid to say 'Yes,' they say nothing. They just stare at me, because they can’t sincerely do it.""

5.  Many see anything but materialistic naturalism as a violation of scientific professionalism.  One reporter described of [a conference in China](http://www.fredheeren.com/washtimes.htm), ""Chinese scientists encouraged the investigation of a variety of new hypotheses to explain the Cambrian explosion: hydrothermal eruptions, sudden seafloor changes, even intelligent design. This last was too much for one American paleontologist who stood up and shouted, 'This is not a scientific conference!'"".  Likewise, as [Lynn Margulis said](http://discovermagazine.com/2011/apr/16-interview-lynn-margulis-not-controversial-right), ""The critics, including the creationist critics, are right about their criticism. It’s just that they've got nothing to offer but intelligent design or 'God did it.'""

6.  Many biologists don't understand engineering.  Many of the patterns claimed to only arise by common descent are the same I see in my own code.

7.  Some recognize insufficiencies but hope new theories will arise to resolve them.  [Depew & Weber published in 2012](http://ge.tt/8zEY5DM/v/0?c): ""Darwinism in its current scientific incarnation has pretty much reached the end of its rope...  however, we are confident that a new and more general theory of evolution is evolving""

8.  A bias toward sensationalism in the media--which is true everywhere and not just with evolutionary biology.

9.  Those who disagree are rarely given a voice, and are often forced to move on to careers outside biology.  Creation evolutionary biologist Todd Wood's response to critic Phil Senter was ""declined [without review](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2012/10/im-still-here.html) by 4 different journals"".  Without review means they didn't read them.  Probably due to some of the reasons above,  Yet being unable publish reinforces the cycle.

10.  The more vocal opponents successfully prevent journals from publishing papers questioning evolutionary theory by [threatening boycott](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/08/on_the_origin_o_3075521.html).  Even when the papers have already passed peer review.  Thankfully the papers were peer reviewed again by another journal and [still published](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8818).

10.  A small number of rather popular evolution ""evangelists"" shame anyone who dissents from the party line.  For example see [Jerry Coyne's response](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/lynn-margulis-disses-evolution-in-discover-magazine-embarrasses-both-herself-and-the-field/) to Lynn Margulis claiming evolution doesn't work (cited above).  Coyne says she's ""dogmatic, willfully ignorant, and intellectually dishonest"", ""wrong in the worst way a scientist can be wrong"", and ""embarrasses both herself and the field"". He and others write those accusations against anyone mentioning problems.

All these procedures and operational steps are required and implemented in human factories, and so in biological cells which operate like factories. It takes a lot of faith to believe, human factories require intelligence, but cells, far more complex and elaborated, do not require intelligence to make them, and intelligent programming to work in a self sustaining and self replicating manner, and to self disctruct, when required.  

Molecular machines: 

The most complex molecular machines are proteins found within cells. 1 These include motor proteins, such as myosin, which is responsible for muscle contraction, kinesin, which moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along microtubules, and dynein, which produces the axonemal beating of motile cilia and flagella. These proteins and their nanoscale dynamics are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been artificially constructed.

Probably the most significant biological machine known is the ribosome. Other important examples include ciliary mobility. A high-level-abstraction summary is that, ""[i]n effect, the [motile cilium] is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines."" Flexible linker domains allow the connecting protein domains to recruit their binding partners and induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics.

Someone can object and say, that human invented machines do nor replicate, and therefor the comparison is invalid. Fact is however, that replication adds further complexity , since humans have not been able to construct self replicating machines in large scale. This is imho what every living cell is able and programmed to do. In order to so so, extremely complex celluar mechanisms are required, like DNA replication.

463,Becoming sceptical towards evolution,2,True,"So I have always considered evolution to be a fact as I was taught evolution at school. Lately I've been getting somewhat deeper into studying the theory of evolution and been attaining more information about DNA and the cell. At school I was taught that the origination of the first living cell (abiogenesis) was proven and I was shown the miller experiment to be some of the evidence, now I know that none of this is true and that abiogenesis is life's greatest mystery. I also learned that the evolutionary model requires the basics of all the existing genes to be present in the cell from which all organisms have decended. I can not get my mind around how so much genetic information could have arranged itself, this seems impossible. I'd like to know if anyone here shares the same doubts and if someone is able to clear up a thing or two. All responses are much appreciated.

DNA replication is the most crucial step in cellular division, a process necessary for life, and errors can cause cancer and many other diseases. Genome duplication presents a formidable enzymatic challenge, requiring the high fidelity replication of millions of bases of DNA. It is a incredible system involving a city of proteins, enzymes, and other components that are breathtaking in their complexity and efficiency. 

How do you get a living cell capable of self-reproduction from a “protein compound … ready to undergo still more complex changes”? Dawkins has to admit:

“Darwin, in his ‘warm little pond’ paragraph, speculated that the key event in the origin of life might have been the spontaneous arising of a protein, but this turns out to be less promising than most of Darwin’s ideas. … But there is something that proteins are outstandingly bad at, and this Darwin overlooked. They are completely hopeless at replication. They can’t make copies of themselves. This means that the key step in the origin of life cannot have been the spontaneous arising of a protein.” (pp. 419–20)

The process of DNA replication depends on many separate protein catalysts to unwind, stabilize, copy, edit, and rewind the original DNA message. In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication involves more than thirty specialized proteins to perform tasks necessary for building and accurately copying the genetic molecule. These specialized proteins include DNA polymerases, primases, helicases, topoisomerases, DNA-binding proteins, DNA ligases, and editing enzymes. DNA needs these proteins to copy the genetic information contained in DNA. But the proteins that copy the genetic information in DNA are themselves built from that information. This again poses what is, at the very least, a curiosity: the production of proteins requires DNA, but the production of DNA requires proteins. 

Proponents of Darwinism are at a loss to tell us how this marvelous system began.  Charles Darwin's main contribution, natural selection, does not apply until a system can reproduce all its parts.  Getting a reproducible cell in a primordial soup is a giant leap, for which today's evolutionary biologists have no answer, no evidence, and no hope.  It amounts to blind faith to believe that undirected, purposeless accidents somehow built the smallest, most complex, most efficient system known to man.

Several decades of experimental work have convinced us that DNA synthesis and replication actually require a plethora of proteins. 

Replication of the genetic material is the single central property of living systems. Dawkins provocatively claimed that organisms are but vehicles for replicating and evolving genes, and I believe that this simple concept captures a key aspect of biological evolution. All phenotypic features of organisms—indeed, cells and organisms themselves as complex physical entities—emerge and evolve only inasmuch as they are conducive to genome replication. That is, they enhance the rate of this process, or, at least, do not impede it. 

DNA replication is an enormously complex process with many different components that interact to ensure the faithful passing down of genetic components that interact to ensure the faithful passing down of genetic information to the next generation. A large number of parts have to work together to that end. In the absence of one or more of a number of the components, DNA replication is either halted completely or significantly compromised, and the cell either dies or becomes quite sick. Many of the components of the replication machinery form conceptually discrete sub-assemblies with conceptually discrete functions.

Wiki mentions that a key feature of the DNA replication mechanism  is that it is designed to replicate relatively large genomes rapidly and with high fidelity. Part of the cellular machinery devoted to  DNA replication and DNA-repair. The regulation of DNA replication is a vital cellular process. It is controlled by a series of mechanisms. One point of control is by modulating the accessibility of replication machinery components ( called the replisome )  to the single origin (oriC) region on the DNA. DNA replication should take place only when a cell is about to divide. If DNA replication occurs too frequently, too many copies of the bacterial chromosome will be found in each cell. Alternatively, if DNA replication does not occur frequently enough, a daughter cell will be left without a chromosome. Therefore, cell division in bacterial cells must be coordinated with DNA replication.

In prokaryotes, the DNA is circular.  Replication starts at a single origin (ori C) and is bi-directional. The region of replicating DNA associated with the single origin is called a replication bubble  and consists of two replication forks moving in opposite direction around the DNA circle. During DNA replication, the two parental strands separate and each acts as a template to direct the enzyme catalysed synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand following the normal base pairing rule. At least 10 different enzymes or proteins  participate in the initiation phase of replication. Three basic steps involved in DNA replication are Initiation, elongation and termination, subdivided in eight discrete steps.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4365

Initiation phase: 

Step 1: Initiation begins, when DNA binds around an initiator protein complex DnaA with the goal to pull the two DNA strands apart. That  creates a number of problems. First of all, the two strands like to be together - they stick to each other just as if they had tiny magnets up and down their length. In order to pull apart the DNA you have to put energy into the system. In modern cells, a protein called DnaA  binds to a specific spot along the DNA, called single origin ( oriC ) and the protein proceeds to open up the double strand. The protein is a monomer, has motifs to bind to unique monomer sites, also they have motifs for protein-protein interaction, thus they can form clusters.   They have hydrophobic regions for helical coiling and protein–protein interactions.  Binding of the monomers to DnaA-A boxes, in ATP dependent manner (proteins have ATPase activity), leads to cooperative binding of more proteins.  This clustering of proteins on DNA makes the DNA to wrap around the proteins, which induces torsional twist and it is this left handed twist that makes DNA to melt at 13-mer region and AT rich region; perhaps the negative super helical topology in this region may further facilitate the melting of the DNA. Opening or unwinding of dsDNA ( double strand DNA )  into single stranded region is an important event in initiation.

Unwinding the DNA Double Helix Requires DNA Helicases,Topoisomerases, and Single- Stranded DNA Binding Proteins
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4374

Step 2:  During DNA replication, the two strands of the double helix must unwind at each replication fork to expose the single strands to the enzymes responsible for copying them. Three classes of proteins with distinct functions facilitate this unwinding process: DNA helicases, topoisomerases, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins ( SSB's). Helicase ( DnaB ) now comes along. The helicase exposes a region of single-stranded DNA that must be kept open for copying to proceed. Helicase is like a snowplow; it is a molecular machine that plows down the middle of the double helix, pushing apart the two strands. this allows the polymerase and associated proteins to travel along behind it in ease and comfort.  DnaB helicase alone has no affinity for ssDNA ( single stranded DNA ) bound by SSB (single- stranded binding protein). Thus, entry of the DnaB helicase complex into the unwound oriC depends on DnaC, a  additional protein factor. DnaC helps or facilitates the helicase to be loaded onto ssDNA  at the replication fork in ATP dependent manner. The DnaB-DnaC complex forms a topologically open, three-tiered toroid.  DnaC remodels DnaB to produce a cleft in the helicase ring suitable for DNA passage. DnaC’s  fold is dispensable for DnaB loading and activation. DnaB possesses autoregulatory elements that control helicase loading and unwinding. Using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, these proteins unwind the DNA double helix in advance of the replication fork, breaking the hydrogen bonds as they go. Helicase recruitment and loading in bacteria is a remarkable process. Following video shows how that works: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzNuLsqMqyE




There is a problem, though, with this setup. If you push apart two DNA strands they generally do not float around separately. If they are close to one another they will rapidly snap back and form a double strand again almost as soon as the helicase passes. Even if the strands are not near each other, a single strand will usually fold up and form hydrogen bonds with itself - in other words, a tangled mess. So it is not enough to push apart the two strands of DNA; there must be a way to keep the strands apart once they have been separated. In modern cells this job is done by single-strand binding proteins, or SBB's. As the helicase separates the strands of DNA, SSB's bind to the single stranded DNA and coats them.   . SSB's prevent DNA from reannealing. SSB's associate to form tetramers around which the DNA is wrapped in a manner that significantly compacts the single-stranded DNA. There is another difficulty in being a double helix. The unwinding associated with DNA replication would create an intolerable amount of supercoiling and possibly tangling in the rest of the DNA. It can be illustrated with a simple example. Take two interwined shoe laces and ask a friend to hold them together at each end. Now take a pencil, insert it between the strands near one end, and start pushing it down toward the other end. As you can see, shoestrings behind the pencil become melted, in the jargon of biochemistry. The shoestrings ahead of the pencil become more and more tangled. It becomes harder and harder to push the pencil forward.  Helicase and polymerase encounter the same problem with DNA. It does not matter wheter you are talking about interwined strings or interwined DNA strands. The problem of tangling is the result of the topological interconnectness of the two strands. If this problem persisted for very long in a  cell, DNA replication would grind to a halt. However, the cell contains several enzymes, called topoisomerases, to take care of the difficulty. The way in which they do so can be illustrated with a enzyme called gyrase. Gyrase binds to DNA, pulls them apart and allows a separate portion of the DNA to pass through the cut. It then reseals the cut and lets go of the DNA. This action decreases the number of twists in DNA. The parental DNA is unwound by DNA helicases and SSB (travels in 5’-3’ direction), the resulting positive super-coiling (torsional stress) is relieved by topoisomerse I and II (DNA gyrase) by inducing transient single stranded breaks.Topoisomerases are amazing enzymes. In this topic, a video shows how they function : 

Topoisomerase II enzymes, amazing evidence of design
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2111-topoisomerase-ii-enzymes-amazing-evidence-of-design?highlight=topoisomerase

In modern organisms, helicase, SSB, and gyrase all are required at the replication fork. Mutants in which any of them are missing are not viable - they die.

Question : Had not all three parts , the SSB binding proteins, the topoisomerase, and the helicase and the DnaC loading proteins not have to be there all at once, otherwise, nothing goes ? They might exercise their function but their own, but then they would not replicate DNA or have function in a bigger picture. Its evident that they had to come together to provide a functional whole.  What we see here are highly coordinated , goal oriented tasks with specific  movements designed to provide a specific outcome. Auto-regulation and control   that seems required beside constant energy supply through ATP enhances the difficulty to make the whole mechanism work in the right manner. All this is awe inspiring and evidences the wise guidance and intelligence required to make all this happening in the right way.

Step 3:  The enzyme DNA primase (primase, an RNA polymerase)  attaches to the DNA and synthesizes a short RNA primer to initiate synthesis of the leading strand of the first replication fork.

Step 4: In the elongation fase, DNA polymerase III extends the RNA primer made by primase.

DNA Polymerase
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4375

DNA polymerase possesses separate catalytic sites for polymerization and degradation of nucleic acid strands. All DNA polymerases make DNA in 5’-3’ direction . A ring-shaped sliding clamp protein encircles the DNA double helix and binds to DNA polymerase, thereby allowing the DNA polymerase to slide along the DNA while remaining firmly attached to it. Most enzymes work by colliding with their substrate, catalyzing a reaction and dissociating from the product. If that were the case with DNA polymerase, then it would bind to DNA, add a nucleotide to the new chain that was being made, and then fall off of the chain. Then ,put the next nucleotide onto the growing end,  bind it and catalyze the addition. This same cycle would have to repeat itself a very large number of times to complete a new DNA chain. Polymerases however catalyze the addition of a nucleotide but do not fall off the DNA. Rather, they stay bound to it, until the next nucleotide comes in, and then they catalyze its addition to the chain. and they again stay bound. If it were not so, the replication process would be very slow. In the cell, polymerases stay on the DNA until their job is completed, which might be only after millions of nucleotides have been joined. This velocity is only possible because of clamp proteins. These have a ring shape. The ring can be opened up.  These clamp proteins are joined to the DNA polymerase in a intricate way, through a clamp loader protein, which has a remarkable shape similar to a human hand. It takes the clamp, like a hand with five fingers would grab it, opens it up becoming like a doughnut shape,where the whole hole in the middle is big enough to accommodate the DNA,  and then, when it is on the DNA, it positions it in a precise manner on the DNA polymerase, where it stays bound until it reaches the end of its polymerizing job. Through this ingenious process, the clamp stabilizes the DNA, making it possible to increase the speed of polymerization dramatically.  They can be seen here:

The sliding clamp and clamp loader
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4376

Question : How would and could natural , unguided processes have figured out 1. the requirement of high-speed of polymerization ? How could they have figured out the right configuration and process to do so ? how could natural processes have emerged with the right proteins incrementally, with the hand-shaped clamp loader, and the precisely fitting clamp , enabling the fast process ?? Even the most intelligent scientists are still not able to imagine how this process is engineered ?  Furthermore, the process requires molecular energy in the form of ATP, and everything must fit together, and be functional. Without the clamp loader protein, the clamp could not be positioned to the polymerase enzyme, and processivity would not rise to the required speed. The whole process must also be regulated and controlled. How could that regulation have been programmed ? Trial and error ? 

Several Proteins Are Required for DNA Replication at the Replication Fork
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4398

The various proteins involved in DNA replication are all closely associated in one large complex, called a replisome.  
Leading strand synthesis:  On the template strand with 3’-5’ orientation, new DNA is made continuously in 5’-3’ direction towards the replication fork. The new strand that is continuously synthesized in 5’-3’ direction is the leading strand. 
Lagging strand synthesis: In the lagging strand, the synthesis of DNA also elongates in a 5ʹ to 3ʹ manner, but it does so in the direction away from the replication fork. In the lagging strand, RNA primers must repeatedly initiate the synthesis of short segments of DNA; thus, the synthesis has to be discontinuous.

The Primase (DnaG) enzyme, and the primosome complex
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4379

 The length of these fragments in bacteria is typically 1000 to 2000 nucleotides. In eukaryotes, the fragments are shorter—100 to 200 nucleotides. Each fragment contains a short RNA primer at the 5ʹ end, which is made by primase. The remainder of the fragment is a strand of DNA made by DNA polymerase III. The DNA fragments made in this manner are known as Okazaki fragments. To complete the synthesis of Okazaki fragments within the lagging strand, three additional events must occur: removal of the RNA primers, synthesis of DNA in the area where the primers have been removed, and the covalent attachment of adjacent fragments of DNA. In E. coli, the RNA primers are removed by the action of DNA polymerase I. This enzyme has a 5ʹ to 3ʹ exonuclease activity, which means that DNA polymerase I digests away the RNA primers in a 5ʹ to 3ʹ direction, leaving a vacant area. DNA polymerase I then synthesizes DNA to fill in this region. It uses the 3ʹ end of an adjacent Okazaki fragment as a primer. , DNA polymerase I would remove the RNA primer from the first Okazaki fragment and then synthesize DNA in the vacant region by attaching nucleotides to the 3ʹ end of the second Okazaki fragment. After the gap has been completely filled in, a covalent bond is still missing between the last nucleotide added by DNA polymerase I and the adjacent DNA strand that had been previously made by DNA polymerase III. To the left of the origin, the top strand is made continuously, whereas to the right of the origin it is made in Okazaki fragments. By comparison, the synthesis of the bottom strand is just the opposite. To the left of the origin it is made in Okazaki fragments and to the right of the origin the synthesis is continuous. Finally the two ends of the fragment have to be joined together; this is the job of an enzyme called DNA ligase.  After the completion of one Okazaki fragment , the equipment has to be released, the clamp has to let go, and a new clamp has to be loaded at the beginning of the next fragment. Clearly the formation and control of the replication fork is an enormously complex process. 

Step 5:   After DNA synthesis by DNA pol III, DNA polymerase I uses its 5’-3’ exonuclease activity to remove the RNA primer and fills the gaps with new DNA. In the next step, finally DNA ligase joins the ends of the DNA fragments together.  As the replisome moves along the DNA in the direction of the replication fork, it must accommodate the fact that DNA is being synthesized in opposite directions along the template on the two stands. Picture above  provides a schematic model illustrating how this might be accomplished by folding the lagging strand template into a loop.Creating such a loop allows the DNA polymerase molecules on both the leading and lagging strands to move in the same physical direction, even though the two template strands are oriented with opposite polarity. The replisome faces special challenges as it makes new DNA at rates that can approach 1,000 nucleotides per second. Unlike the machines that make proteins and RNA, which work relatively sluggishly and in a linear fashion, the replisome must simultaneously copy two strands of DNA that are aligned in opposite directions (5ʹ to 3ʹ and 3ʹ to 5ʹ). Replisome chemistry obeys two rules. 


Questions: How did they arise with that cabability to "" obey two rules "" ?  Suppose a primitive polymerase were duplicated and somehow started to replicate the second strand in the opposite direction while remaining attached to the first strand -  how could that change have been directed , and why should that feat have happened randomly ? 




The DNA polymerase holoenzyme alone would not be able to duplicate the long DNA faithfully. Tests have shown that Polymerase III alone gets stuck. Furthermore, Polymerase III is not a simple enzyme. Its rather three enzymes in one. Beside replicating DNA, it can also degrade DNA in two different ways. It does so by three different, discrete regions of the molecule. The exonuclease activity plays a critical role in replication. It allows the enzyme to proofread the new DNA and cut out any mistakes it has made. Although the polymerase reads the sequence of the old DNA to produce a new DNA, it turns out that simple base bairing allows about one mistake per thousand base pairs copied. Proofreading reduces errors to about one mistake in a million base pairs. The question is if wheter  a proofreading exonuclease and other DNA repair mechanisms had to be present in the very first cell. 

Eigen’s theory revealed the existence of the fundamental limit on the fidelity of replication (the Eigen threshold): If the product of the error (mutation) rate and the information capacity (genome size) is below the Eigen threshold, there will be stable inheritance and hence evolution; however, if it is above the threshold, the mutational meltdown and extinction become inevitable (Eigen, 1971). The Eigen threshold lies somewhere between 1 and 10 mutations per round of replication (Tejero, et al., 2011) regardless of the exact value, staying above the threshold fidelity is required for sustainable replication and so is a prerequisite for the start of biological evolution. Indeed, the very origin of the first organisms presents at least an appearance of a paradox because a certain minimum level of complexity is required to make self-replication possible at all; high-fidelity replication requires additional functionalities that need even more information to be encoded (Penny, 2005). The crucial question in the study of the origin of life is how the Darwin-Eigen cycle started—how was the minimum complexity that is required to achieve the minimally acceptable replication fidelity attained? In even the simplest modern systems, such as RNA viruses with the replication fidelity of only about 10^3 and viroids that replicate with the lowest fidelity among the known replicons (about 10^2; Gago, et al., 2009), replication is catalyzed by complex protein polymerases. The replicase itself is produced by translation of the respective mRNA(s), which is mediated by the immensely complex ribosomal apparatus. Hence, the dramatic paradox of the origin of life is that, to attain the minimum complexity required for a biological system to start on the Darwin-Eigen spiral, a system of a far greater complexity appears to be required. How such a system could evolve is a  puzzle that defeats conventional evolutionary thinking, all of which is about biological systems moving along the spiral; the solution is bound to be unusual. 

DNA damage and repair
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2043-dna-repair?highlight=dna+repair
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p30-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4401

Replication forks may stall frequently and require some form of repair to allow completion of chromosomal duplication. Failure to solve these replicative problems comes at a high price, with the consequences being genome instability, cell death and, in higher organisms, cancer. Replication fork repair and hence reloading of DnaB may be needed away from oriC at any point within the chromosome and at any stage during chromosomal duplication. The potentially catastrophic effects of uncontrolled initiation of chromosomal duplication on genome stability suggests that replication restart must be regulated as tightly as DnaA-directed replication initiation at oriC. This implies reloading of DnaB must occur only on ssDNA at repaired forks or D-loops rather than onto other regions of ssDNA, such as those created by blocks to lagging strand synthesis.Thus an alternative replication initiator protein, PriA helicase, is utilized during replication restart to reload DnaB back onto the chromosome 

Question: Could the first cell, with its required complement of genes coded for by DNA, have successfully reproduced for a significant number of generations without a proofreading function ? A further question is how the function of synthesis of the lagging strand could have arisen, and the machinery to do so. That is, the Primosome, and the function of Polymerase I to remove the short peaces of RNA that the cell uses to prime replication, allowing the polymerase III function to fill the gap. These functions all require precise regulation, and coordinated functional machine-like steps. These are all complex, advanced functions and had to be present right from the beginning. How could this complex machinery have emerged in a gradual manner ? the Primosome had to be fully functional, otherwise polymerisation could not have started, since a prime sequence is required.

Step 6: Finally DNA ligase joins the ends of the DNA fragments together.

Termination phase: 

Termination of DNA replication
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4399

Step 7: The two replication forks meet ~ 180  degree opposite to ori C, as DNA is circular in prokaryotes. Around this region there are several terminator sites which arrest the movement of forks by binding to the tus gene product, an inhibitor of helicase (Dna B).
Step 8: Once replication is complete, the two double stranded circular DNA molecules (daughter strands) remain interlinked. Topoisomerase II makes double stranded cuts to unlink these molecules.

According to mainstream scientific papers, the following twenty protein and protein complexes are essential for prokaryotic DNA replication. Each one mentioned below. They cannot be reduced. If one is missing, DNA replication cannot occur: 

Pre-replication complex  Formation of the pre-RC is required for DNA replication to occur
DnaA The crucial component in the initiation process is the DnaA protein
DiaA this novel protein plays an important role in regulating the initiation of chromosomal replication via direct interactions with the DnaA initiator.
DAM methylase  It’s gene expression requires full methylation of GATC at its promoter region. 
DnaB helicase Helicases are essential enzymes for DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms.
DnaC Loading of the DnaB helicase is the key step in replication initiation.  DnaC is essential for replication in vitro and in vivo. 
HU-proteins  HU protein is required for proper synchrony of replication initiation
SSB Single-stranded binding proteins  Single-stranded DNA binding proteins are essential for the sequestration and processing of single-stranded DNA. 6
SSBs from the OB domain family play an essential role in the maintenance of genome stability, functioning in DNA replication, the repair of damaged DNA, the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and in telomere maintenance. SSB proteins play an essential role in DNA metabolism by protecting single-stranded DNA and by mediating several important protein–protein interactions. 7
Hexameric DNA helicases DNA helicases are essential during DNA replication because they separate double-stranded DNA into single strands allowing each strand to be copied.
DNA polymerase I and III DNA polymerase 3 is essential for the replication of the leading and the lagging strands whereas DNA polymerase 1 is essential for removing of the RNA primers from the fragments and replacing it with the required nucleotides. 
DnaG Primases  They are essential for the initiation of such phenomena because DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo synthesis and can only elongate existing strands 
Topoisomerases  are essential in the separation of entangled daughter strands during replication. This function is believed to be performed by topoisomerase II in eukaryotes and by topoisomerase IV in prokaryotes. Failure to separate these strands leads to cell death. 
Sliding clamp and clamp loader the clamp loader is a crucial aspect of the DNA replication machinery.  Sliding clamps are DNA-tracking platforms that are essential for processive DNA replication in all living organisms 
Primase (DnaG) Primases are essential RNA polymerases required for the initiation of DNA replication, lagging strand synthesis and replication restart.  They are essential for the initiation of such phenomena because DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo synthesis and can only elongate existing strands. 
RTP-Ter complex Ter sequences would not seem to be essential, but they may prevent overreplication by one fork in the event that the other is delayed or halted by an encounter with DNA damage or some other obstacle
Ribonuclease H  RNase H1 plays essential roles in generating and clearing RNAs that act as primers of DNA replication. 
Replication restart primosome Replication restart primosome is a complex dynamic system that is essential for bacterial survival. 
DNA repair: 
RecQ helicase  In prokaryotes RecQ is necessary for plasmid recombination and DNA repair from UV-light, free radicals, and alkylating agents. 
RecJ nuclease the repair machinery must be designed to act on a variety of heterogeneous DNA break sites.

I do not know of any scientific paper  that explains in a detailed manner how DNA replication de novo or any of its parts might have emerged in a naturalistic manner, without involving intelligence. The systems responsible for DNA replication are well beyond the explanatory power of unguided natural processes without guiding intelligence involved. Indeed, machinery of the complexity and sophistication of that described above is, is in my view best explained through a intelligent designer.

Precisely BECAUSE WE KNOW that each of the described and mentioned parts is indispensable, it had to arise all at once. We know of intelligence being able to project, plan and make such a motor-like system based on lots of information , and it could not have emerged through evolution ( even less so because evolution depends on dna replication being in place ) we can infer rationally design as the best explanation. Chance is no reasonable option to explain the origin of DNA replication since the individual parts would have no function by their own, and there is no reason why matter aleatory-like would group itself in such highly organized and complex machine-like system.",1448878090,44,2015-11-30 05:08:10

470,Creationist Logic Demonstrates Macro Evolution,12,True,"Creationist Logic Demonstrates Macro Evolution

According to creationists only organisms of the same 'kind' can breed with each other.

This means that the plants the Senecio vulgaris and Senecio squalidus must be of the same 'kind' since in 1979
it was discovered that they could interbreed and produce a hybrid.  

Now the hybrid generated by this inter-breeding was given the name Senecio eboracensis. This new plant can breed with itself which means it is a viable hybrid. However, and this is the really important part, it cannot breed with either of its parent plants or any other plants.  So this means, according to creationist logic, that the new hybrid must be of a different 'kind'.

So what we have is two plants of one 'kind' interbreeding to create a new never before seen 'kind'. 

A new 'kind' has evolved as a result of hybridization within an existing 'kind'. Which of course is macro evolution.

Needless to say as these are plants you can of course repeat this on your own kitchen table as often as you want. You know repeatable testable evidence of macro evolution, the evolution of a new 'kind'.

476,Making the Intelligent Designer Dance,5,True,"Making the Intelligent Designer Dance  by Arthur Paliden

According to  Intelligent Design proponents Behe[1], Meyer[2], et all random mutation in DNA sequences do in fact occur. However, these random mutations are always either benign or detrimental to the organism.  This is because the probability of a beneficial mutation, as demonstrated by Behe, Meyer, et al is so infinitesimally small that it can only occur with the intervention of an Intelligent Designer.  An Intelligent Designer that is of course capable of suspending the laws of physics in regards to Brownian motion and those of chemistry in regards to automatic nature of chemical bonding so as to manipulate the molecular bonding as it desires.

Of course this means that the favorable mutation that was observed in the E. coli Long-term Experimental Evolution Project[3] must have been engineered by an Intelligent Designer.  Demonstrating that Intelligent Design is in fact a continuous on going process. Which is also why it is misinterpreted today as the effects of evolution by random mutation.

Now as part of the E. coli Long-term Experimental  samples of the population were frozen at at set intervals during the experiment and continue to be archived today.   This means that the evolution of the population can be initiated and studied from any point in the time line where a frozen sample exists. What we see when we do this is the favorable mutation always happens within the same generational period.

So, because the mutation is beneficial and not benign or disadvantageous, the Intelligent Designer must have playing a part. Which of course means that we now have the ability to make the Intelligent Designer function at times of our own choosing by starting the experiment from any point prior to the occurrence of the favorable mutation. 

Therefore we, mere mortals, can now make the Intelligent Designer, dance.

482,Is intelligent design fairly categorised as a type of creationism? I don't think so.,0,True,"I posted this in /r/DebateAnAtheist a while ago, but the responses there weren't particularly good, I thought. I hope we might have a cordial exchange on this topic on this sub. I do have a lot of work coming up over the next week or so, so responses may be slow.

Why don't I believe that intelligent design is fairly categorised as a type of creationism?

Well, I think we can distinguish between two different questions:

1. The modern intelligent design movement has roots in, and currently overlaps with creationist circles.

2. One can conceptually distinguish design inferences from the supernatural.

---------------


As I see it, these two questions are too often run together as if they are the same, but they really are quite separate. 

I think there is good evidence for 1.

But I also think that 2. is true.

Why? In our daily life, we make inferences to design all the time, but we don't necessarily postulate a supernatural designer.

--------------------

An objection:

""What about the mechanism though? Doesn't ID necessarily postulate miracles? And isn't that creationism?""

I don't think this is true, and here's Mike Behe to tell us why.

Prelude: when I previously posted this, it seems that many people have saw the words ""fine-tuning"" and then thought ""Aha! He's defending the fine-tuning argument in his post"". I'm not: please notice how the long passage by Behe I quote is in the context ""What about the mechanism though? Doesn't ID necessarily postulate miracles"" **NOT** ""Here's why I think we can make a design inference from the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the universe.""

Behe: *“Suppose the laboratory of Pope Mary’s physicist is next to a huge warehouse in which is stored a colossal number of little shiny spheres. Each sphere encloses the complete history of a separate, self-contained, possible universe, waiting to be activated. (In other words, the warehouse can be considered a vast multiverse of possible universes, but none of them have yet been made real.) One enormous section of the warehouse contains all the universes that, if activated, would fail to produce life. They would develop into universes consisting of just one big black hole, universes without stars, universes without atoms, or other abysmal failures. In a small wing of the huge warehouse are stored possible universes that have the right general laws and constants of nature for life. Almost all of them, however, fall into the category of “close, but no cigar.”*

*For example, in one possible universe the Mars-sized body would hit the nascent earth at the wrong angle and life would never commence. In one small room of the small wing are those universes that would develop life. Almost all of the, however, would not develop intelligent life. In one small closet of the small room of the small wing are placed possible universes that would actually develop intelligent life. One afternoon the überphysicist walks from his lab to the warehouse, passes by the huge collection of possible dead universes, strolls into the small wing, over to the small room, opens the small closet, and selects one of the extremely rare universes that is set up to lead to intelligent life. Then he “adds water” to activate it. In that case the now-active universe is fine-tuned to the very great degree of detail required, yet it is activated in a “single creative act”.*

*...There are myriad Powerball-winning events, but they aren’t due to chance. They were foreseen, and chosen from all the possible universes.”*

The Edge of Evolution, 231-232

So, given that finely-tuned events would warrant an inference to design, but involve an unbroken sequence of secondary causation, the objection fails.

Some other objections:

""Haven't you ever read Ken Miller/Nick Matzke/Carroll/Coyne's critique of Behe? He/they show(s) how irreducible complexity fails?""

Yes I have. These critiques, if successful, refute ID arguments, but don't refute 2, and that's what I'd like to discuss in this post.

""Haven't you ever read the Wedge Document?""

487,A bird called Archaeopteryx,5,True,"We leave cladistics to experts. And IF we criticize it, we base in on a minimal understanding and knowledge of the subject. To achieve this, one has to go through at least the essentials of the subject. That is the LEAST we might expect for decent and sound debate. But creationists know nothing about anatomy, taxonomy and cladistics. That does not seem to hinder them making gross conclusions about the classification of fossil species and their import for evolution theory.

Let's take Archaeopteryx. Archaeopteryx is classified by modern evolutionary biology as a bird (class Aves). 
The interesting part here is that A. had distinct reptilian traits, NOT FOUND in extant birds, which are:

-	long, bony tail but no pygostyle like birds

-	teeth, similar to those of small, meat-eating dinosaurs (not all teeth in all species look the same) –	birds do not have teeth

-	it had no bill but a beak with teeth

-	neck attached to skull from the rear

-	ribs without joints or uncinate processes, and not articulated with the sternum

-	sacrum that occupies six vertebrae

-	metacarpals free, wrist hand joint flexible

-	claws on three unfused digits

-	pelvic girdle and femur joint shaped like those of archosaurs in many details

-	bones of pelvis unfused

-	etc. in total some 100 (count: HUNDRED) differences from birds but similar to reptilian traits.

But, as far as the palaeontological experts can tell, it most likely was able to fly.

And we have now a bunch of other species and specimen found which clearly show a gradual loss of those reptilian traits and also many that on the other hand are even more reptilian like than A. 
Archaeopteryx is just one of those and even sitting on a side branch.

This is how cladistics works.

The REAL question here is: WHAT is Archaeopteryx as a bird doing with all these distinct REPTILIAN TRAITS in the first place?

While science has progressed and we now know of many transitional species with painstakingly detailed, empirical work done on it, creationists are still moroning around with Archaeopteryx insisting on the bird status of the species. As if palaeontologists (AKA ""evolutionists"") didn't know - it were THEY who provided that information in the first place. Most palaeontologists consider A. to be a bird and have done so for decades by now. Parrot circuits – not interrupted by fresh input from empirical research and the parrots not being schooled to even the slightest level of scientific knowledge – can go on for decades.

Moreover, as I explained in my other post on the no longer missing links (https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3l2ef0/missing_links_not_missing_anymore), the exact taxonomic status of A. as a bird or a reptile is entirely IRRELEVANT. The only things, evolutionary spoken, relevant here are those many reptilian traits exhibited in what after all appears to be a (early) bird. If, on the other hand, it were found to be unable to fly, one could say we've got a dinosaur here. In that case the question still would be then: what the heck is a dinosaur doing with all kinds of distinct bird traits? There is no going around *transitional* specimen. They ARE transitional. As said in that post, evolution is about the transition of traits, not about the taxonomic classification.

When, after all, A. should be considered to be a bird, what the heck is it doing then with all those distinct reptilian traits - THAT is the question to be asked. Or, even more profoundly: BECAUSE of A. being a bird, its reptilian traits are a HALLMARK of evolution. Yet again, in their utter ignorance, creationists are ACTUALLY making a point for evolution theory.

Now google the Ferguson 2005 findings on chicken embryos developing teeth.
From this study we now know that chickens have the full genetic blueprint for growing teeth. In chickens these genes lay dormant, their expression is shut off by past mutations. Ferguson managed to bring those genes to expression again. Apart from its possible practical use (regrowth of lost limbs), the question here is: WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE do birds like hens still have the full genetic blueprint for growing teeth?

We all know of the power of DNA to identify family relationships. If siblings lost family and meet them later again and want to be sure whether they are family, DNA can prove for that 99,9999% validly and decisively. DNA is even able to determine to a certain degree whether an unknown culprit in a crime case would be of any descent (Hispanic, Caucasian, Chinese etc.) by analyzing his or her DNA left on the crime scene. 

But DNA is also useful to establish phylogenetic relationships (the “family” links between species). Guess what species we found genetically closest to birds (in this case they took a chicken)? Yes, crocodiles. And crocodiles are reptiles, like dinosaurs.

And guess what we find if we compare the remnants of collagen found in a Tyrannosaur specimen (the famous Mary Schweitzer research)? Yes, it matches of extant species living today the chicken’s most. Even closer than crocodiles (as predicted as well by evolution). Hence we know that birds evolved from reptiles. But we even know more precisely that they evolved from theropoda lineages (bipedal saurischian dinosaurs, among those Tyrannosaur) and not crocodiles (who establish an complete own superorder within the class of reptiles alongside dinosaurs). Gee, why does this match the earlier paleontological (fossil) findings so perfectly?

Only posts with *substantial arguments* based on *empirical research* (either by experiment or field observations according to established, scientific standards) and clear *explicit referring to traceable scientific sources* will be answered. The others will be discarded without further ado.

488,Missing links - not missing anymore.,6,True,"It's funny how creationists try to deal with the clear evidence of transitional fossils. Either they put it off by saying such fossils are a hoax or they start a mostly embarrassing layman treatise on the morphological and anatomical implications. Or they classify the fossil to be either the ancestral lineage or the descendant one.

We don't need to go into their layman treatises. It's too embarrassing to even read. Laymen tattling about highly specialized stuff which requires years of hard training are as shameful as the notorious smoker who starts elaborate medical treatises in order to call into question the hazardous effects of smoking on health.

Evolutionary hoaxes are based upon lying about the real import of some disputable cases in the biological literature or just exploiting the very rare real fraud. It never deals with the often dozens or even hundreds up to thousands of other specimen. Putting off 100 specimen because of one fraud is just too ridiculous to even take into serious consideration. It also flagrantly and poignantly contrasts the hundreds of hoaxes and frauds made by creationists. Like the Creationist's museum where little children are depicted riding saddled dinosaurs, as if you are stuck in a Fred Flintstones episode. 

The third argument is actually the funniest one. It is always most endearing to behold creationists being stuck in the noble act of taxonomy.

Now classifying fossils is a highly specialized trade which always requires years of training. Not particularly to be left to untrained laymen all creationists are. 

Also professional taxonomists often have great difficulty in classifying fossils though.

When the first specimen of Homo erectus was found by the Dutch explorer and palaeoanthropologist Eugène Dubois, he coined it ""Java man"". It started a decades long dispute within palaeontology how to classify this find. Was it a hominid? Or more likely an ape (""pithicus"")? Or a human who suffered of some deforming anomaly?

The last argument, was it some kind of maybe genetic anomaly, can be discarded very easily. First of all in the meantime we found dozens of new Homo erectus specimens. Fossil finds are extremely rare. The odds that DOZENS of such rather rare specimens ALL happen to originate from unfortunate individuals who suffered some malformation, can be statistically ruled out - especially when we know how rare those genetic conditions themselves are.

Secondly, the particular traits of Homo erectus specimen do anatomically not resemble the typical features you might find in genetic anomalies among humans. If anyone here knows of a creationist treatise where such morphological analysis is done, let me know. When it comes to specialized research, the Great Dodging inevitably starts.

Thirdly, the cranial “deformities” go along with a series of other typical anatomical treats shared by Homo erectus specimens. Relative to modern humans it had a rather protruding muzzle, small brains (an average of 900 cc over all specimens, although it stood as high as extant humans), smaller cervical and lumbar swellings, hardly any protruding nose, longer vertebral spines, an elongated femoral neck, etc. All these anatomical traits put together rule out any genetic malformation.

Dubois' classification of Java man as a transitional fossil between apes and humans was not selling hot cakes among his then colleagues. 

Apparently it's hard to classify transitional fossils adequately altogether. The reason is the transitional character itself. It is the nature of transitional fossils to be classified within taxonomy only with the greatest difficulty.

Let's have Homo erectus again. Basically, if we leave all kinds of minor details away, Erectus was a hominid which was very human-like from the neck down but differed considerably “upstairs”. Now what is it? After decades of quarrel, taxonomists decided it was a hominid. And not an “ape”. There are good reasons for it. We meanwhile found that Homo erectus was fabricating tools. And there’s good evidence that it also used fire.

Nice for the taxonomists. IRRELEVANT for evolution theory. The taxonomic categorization and classification of fossil specimens into some taxon, genus or species is their own business of taxonomists. Whether Erectus was to be named Pithecus erectus or Homo erectus is only *informative* for evolutionists. THEIR argument is about unearthed specimens exhibiting varying mixes of traits that are BOTH typical to ancestral predecessor AND to the descendant life forms. The fossil evidence for evolution is about transitioning TRAITS. It is NOT about taxonomy.

And the more difficult the taxonomic classification of some fossil find turns out to be, THE BETTER for evolution. Because evolution theory PREDICTS transitional fossils that are hard to classify. By their very transitional nature.

So the hilarious scene of creationists desperately classifying fossils, unhindered by any sound technical knowledge and understanding of anatomy – thus making gross errors and distortions underway – then nevertheless jumping to an IRRELEVANT conclusion about the exact classification, is always funny to behold.

But it becomes even more funny when creationists are mocking about the apparent inability of taxonomists to classify specimen properly. “See, the evolutionists cannot even make up their own mind whether this is a hominid or an ape”. 

They think they made an important point.

But in their utter ignorance and muddleheadiness, they just made an point pro evolution.

This is how stupidity looks like.

489,The quote mine index number,10,True,"In statistics we measure phenomena often by means of index numbers.
Biologist Richard Dawkins introduced an interesting one, the quote mining index as an indicator for creationist's dishonesty.

He let Google count the number of quote hits of one of the things he said in one of his books. Then he let Google count the number of a very next sentence in the very same phrase of that book, the one that brings the misquotation back into its correct context. He retrieved a ratio of 6 to 1.

Let's do that again with one of the most quote mined sentences in the work of Darwin: the eye.

The quote is: ""To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree"".

Creationists LOVE that phrase. Hence they quote it as if their life depended upon it. The number of Google hits counts 8,940.

In the FIRST LINE of the paragraph that immediately follows that quote, we find the sentence ""Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, ..."". The number of Google hits for that quote is 2,650.

The rate is 8,940 / 2,650 = 3.4.
That's a fair rate of creationist's dishonesty.
Because I am very merciful. A quick check of the first 3 pages of both Google score lists, reveals that most of those 8,940 hits are of creationist's sources, while most of the 2,650 list is by scientists and others, trying to correct the quote mine.

490,Evolution of land animals,5,True,"Tiktaalik is a transitional fossil. It is a link between fish and amphibians. The mixture of both fish and tetrapod characteristics found in Tiktaalik include: 

Fish traits: 

- gills 

- scales 

- fins 

""Fishapod"" traits: 

- tetrapod limb bones and joints, including a functional wrist joint and radiating, but fish-like fins instead of toes 

- half-fish, half-tetrapod ear region. 

Tetrapod traits: 

- rib bones 

- mobile neck with separate pectoral girdle 

- lungs.

And that's only a concise summary of all traits examined.

The evolutionary preceding lob-finned fish already had bony skeletons and were using BOTH lungs and gills. Lungs developed out of the swim bladder, which many fish of those times had - but the lobe-finned of course was lacking. 

On the other evolutionary side of Tiktaalik we have further more species with even more tetrapod developments. And everything in between all those, like Eusthenopteron, Gogonasus, Panderichthys, Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, Hynerpeton, Tulerpeton, Eryops. Etc. All to be found on wiki ""tetrapods"". The fossil record of the fish - tatrapod evolution is becoming rather crowded lately.

So it's not even an exhausting list. All these species show a morphologically and chronologically perfect development from fish to tetrapods.

There is a time to discuss and a time it is not worth debating anymore. When the empirical evidence is decisive and clear.

491,Evolution of cetaceans,4,True,"Let's talk a bit about the whales, dolphins and their direct relatives, the cetaceans.

First: we found fossils of a marine animal Dorudon. Without doubt is was a fully aquatic animal. It resembles modern cetaceans to a high degree. It only had one very particular trait: HIND LIMBS. Clearly visible, complete with all anatomic features defining hind limbs in vertebrae. Those hind limbs were attached to a pelvis, also still in place but in a very atavistic fashion. And here is the interesting part: the pelvis was completely DETACHED from the spine. Clearly it could not walk with those. Especially because of their size: hardly larger than modern housecat’s ones. A bit too tiny for a 5-6 metres long animal that approximately weighted some 600 kilo’s.
Now, tell me, what is a MARINE animal doing with a dysfunctional pelvis and hind limbs in the first place? 

But Dorudon isn’t the only one we found.

We found at least 7 other species with a varying mix of both a land animal and cetacean features. Moreover, these species clearly show gradual transition from land animal to cetacean in all relevant features (nostril, limbs, tail, pelvis etc.). This transition follows a concordant chronological order, proven by dating.

Extant cetaceans show closer genetic, biochemical and organic relationship to land animals than to marine life. The DNA of cetaceans most resembles that of hippopotamus, a (not surprisingly!) semi aquatic LAND DWELLING animal, and NOT that of other marine life. Cetaceans breathe with lungs and not gills. They possess brains with the very distinct features only mammals have. Apart from the lost hind limbs and pelvis, their skeleton resembles those of land animals, not that of marine life, both in morphology and the bony tissue make-up. They are mammals, giving life birth to their young and milk feed them. They are warm-blooded. 

99% of all mammals species live on land. Moreover, the earlier mammals before any cetacean was around in the fossil record, all were land dwelling animals.

But there is more. Many cetaceans are born with vestigial pelvises and hind limbs, sometimes with remnants of the digits complete. Furthermore, ALL cetaceans develop hind limbs in the first weeks of their embryonic development, these eventually being dissolved in a later fetal stage. The same applies to fur. Cetacean embryos also develop fur, in a later stage of gestation to be shed.

The reason for this is that ALL cetaceans have found to possess the almost complete genetic make-up for developing hind limbs and pelvises. Otherwise it would have been impossible to produce embryonic atavisms or vestiges in the first place – such structures can only develop by gene expression. Hence the mere existence of vestiges and atavisms are the evidence as such for underlying genes. And the genes to produce such rather complex structures are inevitably complex themselves. So it is virtually impossible for these gene complexes to be formed in one instance in some animal, let alone that atavisms occur in every cetacean embryo. 

What actually happened is that some so called Hox-genes (regulatory genes) were “shut off” by mutations. How this works and has been observed, can be read here: pnas.org/content/103/22/84144.full. The geneticists even found WHICH hox genes exactly were involved. And why cetacean embryos still start to develop hind limbs in early embryonic development. Because the genetic relay race kind of gene expression still functions in its initial stage - the mutations in the Hox genes affect later stages. Or how some cetaceans develop almost intact, atavistic hind limbs. Or how some whales still have vestigial pelvises.

Now here some questions:
- what were ancient MARINE animals like Dorudon doing with detached and thus dysfunctional hind limbs and pelvises in the first place?
- why is the fossil record showing such a perfect evolution from a land ungulate to marine animals?
- why are modern cetaceans genetically closest to land animals and not to any other sea life? 
- why are cetaceans mammals while all other mammals are basically LAND DWELLING animals?
- why were the first distinguishable mammals showing up in the fossil record exclusively land dwellers?
- why do cetaceans develop vestigial hind limbs and pelvises on a very regular basis?
- why do cetaceans develop hind limbs (and fur!) in early embryonic development and why are these aborted in later stages of gesticulation?
- why have all cetaceans the almost complete genetic make-up for hind limbs, found in land animals? There has NEVER been found ANY fish with such a genetic blueprint.

492,non-Evolution of differing ORC's,0,True,"From 
https://answersingenesis.org/biology/microbiology/information-processing-differences-between-bacteria-and-eukarya/


>
The leading strand of DNA is synthesized continuously, while the antiparallel lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously, as Okazaki fragments, because nucleotides are always added in a 5′ to 3′ direction in the cell. The RNA primers will be removed and exchanged with DNA by gap filling and the Okazaki fragments will be joined by DNA ligase. During the termination stage, terminators (in bacteria), or chromosomal ends called telomeres (in eukarya), will be synthesized. As detailed below, bacteria and eukarya differ in their requirements for DNA replication initiation and termination in both their DNA sequences (cis-elements) and in their trans-elements, i.e. the proteins that execute and regulate DNA replication (Forterre 2013; Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999; Makarova and Koonin 2013; Merhej and Raoult 2012; O’Donnell, Langston, Stillman 2013; Skarstad and Katayama 2013).

>A.1 Differences in the initiation site of replication

>The first step of DNA replication is the recognition of start sites at the origins of replication by origin-binding proteins. Strikingly, the origins of DNA replication are species specific. Duplicating DNA in E. coli requires an E. coli-specific origin of replication, while duplication in S. cerevisiae requires an S. cerevisiae-specific origin of replication. These origins of replication are not interchangeable. This fact is experimentally demonstrated on a daily basis in many laboratories throughout the world: to clone and replicate an S. cerevisiae gene in E. coli requires a vector with an E. coli origin of replication, and to clone and replicate a bacterial gene in S. cerevisiae requires a vector carrying an S. cerevisiae origin of replication (plus a yeast centromere).

>Bacteria and eukarya also differ in the numbers of origins of replication. Bacteria typically have a single circular chromosome with a single origin of replication, while eukarya have hundreds or thousands of origins of replication spread across multiple linear chromosomes. So how could evolution accomplish the change from one circular DNA strand to multiple linear chromosomes (for example, 16 pairs = 32 in yeast)? The bacterium might begin by evolving an enzyme to chop up its DNA into 16 pieces. But since it would have only one origin of replication, only 1/16th of the DNA would be replicated and the cell would die. It would have to simultaneously generate new origins of replication for all 16 pieces.

493,Mik Ogniokrwisty's comparison of Creationistic and Evolutionary world origin theories,0,True,"(The following is a script I've written out for a Youtube video. I am too f*ing lazy to record it all though ._.)
Hello there I am Mik Ogniokrwisty and I do not believe in... wait for it...
fairies.
Whatever I do or don’t believe in God is irrelevant because he’s God, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. And supposedly God wanted to create the Earth out of nothing, spawn in 2 people and allow it to develop into 7 billion or whatever the earth’s population is at the time of you watching this video. Also supposedly there is no God and we all evolved from a single cell that eventually became 7 billion people and all the whole collective fauna and flora of the entire bloody planet.
So let’s compare these two and see if either one is as stupid as the other. Now, let’s split the screen into 2 parts and assume those 2 halves are both their own universes. In the top universe, the Adam and Eve are true and in the bottom one, the evolution is true.

So we know how it started and how it ended but what about the middle?
Adam and eve would have had to had a lot of children that then spread across the globe. They most likely can’t swim for thousands of miles so either a) the continents were all connected or b) the water dividing them was very limited. Then their skin colour changed in places, and they had a whole lotta more incestous sex to create babies that created more babies, and eventually these babies took over the planet over the course of several thousand years.

And if Evolution happened, we started off with one cell that started rapidly multiplying, reaching triple or more digits before starting to branch out. Some of these cells ended up in hot water and had to develop heat resistance, some ended up somewhere closer to the Titanic’s favourite vacation spot and had to wear some fur coats. But because there weren't any available, they just grew thicker skin. Some of them decided it would be a good idea to work together - division of labor and resources helped and they could be more versatile. This grew to become three, fourty, five hundred, six sixty six, seven thousand and so forth cells working together until one day we suddenly had things crawling out of the water and re-enacting the scene from Spore where your species migrates from water onto land. These things started to grow bigger and smarter until one day we ended up having having talking monkeys that then turned into the bipedal planet-wide earth-rapers that we are today over the course of several milion years. Captain Planet is not happy about the earth-raping.

So in scenario one we have a very small starting number of specimen rapidly increasing in numbers within a pre-made environment that could be altered at will, spreading across the planet, changing depending on where they are, and becoming the dominant species despite the scenario creator’s nuking the whole project at least once, setting it up for failure and punishing the subjects for it, supposedly letting it run on its own but constantly interfering and changing the parameters.
In scenario two we have a very small starting number of specimen steadily increasing in numbers in a constantly but slowly changing environment that had nothing interfering in it, spreading acorss the planet, changing depending on where they are and what they did, and becoming the dominant species. And well, every damn species.

Are there problems with these scenarios? Yes. There are, I count four of them. *wheatly looks at the counter suspiciously*
The first problem is that I had to simplify the squares and circles out of this for the sake of comparison and to make the explanation fairly simple. There’s a lot more to both of these and I may look into them in the future.
Second problem is that neither of these was ever observed. Actually, that’s not exactly true. We did observe evolution in laboratorial conditions. We haven’t seen the first cell, mostly because... How the fuck were we supposed to, humanity didn’t even exist - nothing even had legs back then. For all we know, the first cell could have been eaten by the second cell, melted alive and farted out as an empty husk while the second cell stole all the glory. On the other hand, we never saw Adam and Eve either! There’s no witness accounts recorded on audio, video, or even paper. Back when they supposedly were alive, there was no way to write it all down, and the only source wa have for it is a book that, for all we know, might be just a book that ate another book, shat out the cover, rearranged the letters and presented itself as the one and only.

Third problem is that we know that Adam and Eve could never have made enough children to even start a human population anywhere due to problems inbreeding would cause - there’s a reason why you’re not allowed to have intercourse with your mother or sister. One it’s considered freaking disgusting and two, it’s got almost no chance, if any, to produce a healthy offspring and the one family that would’ve started it all would’ve died.
There’s a counterargument to this problem that states that incest wasn’t a problem back then, and it fits in with the scenario where the population underwent changes. Fair enough.
Fourth problem, this time with the evolutionary theory, is that we don’t have a complete fossil record so we can’t be sure this model is true. ...So? Hey look, that water we thought was cold an hour ago is now boiling. It MUST have suddenly spiked from 20 to 100 degrees. There’s NO WAY anyone checked its temeprature 10 minutes ago. What? We have a picture that shows it was 70 degrees 3 minutes ago? And another one from 10 minutes ago that it was 50? No, that’s not enough evidence that it slowly heated up. I won’t believe it unless someone records the whole damn thing start to finish! Hashtag sarcasm. *show pictures of hashish, a price tag, the SAR-21 rifle and a chasm with each syllable*


So... which do we believe? The one where Adam and Eve started it all, or the one where we come from apes and single-cell organisms? Do we trust gut instinct? A book? Or some theories that one man issues way back in the day?

That’s the fifth problem: I did the whole thing wrong. What we should do is not assume something was true and then fit the evidence into it, but look at the evidence we have and, IF we have theories, see which one it supports best or make a completely new one. So whatever you’re a zealous creationist or evolutionist, whatever you do or do not believe in god, whatever you’re sceptic or gullaible, I implore you.

497,"The amazing fatty acid synthase nano factories, and origin of life scenarios",2,True,"The amazing fatty acid synthase nano factories, and origin of life scenarios 

The four basic categories of molecules for building life are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.  Here we will give a closer look at fatty acids,  constituents of lipids, and their biosynthesis.

Lipids (‘fats’) are essential for the formation of a cell membrane that contains the cell contents, as well as for other cell functions. The cell membrane, comprised of several different complex lipids, is an essential part of a free-living cell that can reproduce itself.

Lipids have much higher energy density than sugars or amino acids, so their formation in any chemical soup is a problem for origin of life scenarios (high energy compounds are thermodynamically much less likely to form than lower energy compounds).  Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains of various lengths. The ability to synthesize a variety of lipids is essential to all organisms.  Fatty acid synthesis requires the oxidation of the co-factor NADPH.

The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway. Due to the complexity of the metabolic pathways, it has been argued that metabolism‐like chemical reaction sequences are unlikely to be catalysed by simple environmental catalysts.


This constitutes a serious problem for naturalistic explanations of the origin of life. The pentose phosphate pathway requires 7 enzymes, and is interdependent with glycolysis , since the beginning molecule for the pentose phosphate pathway is glucose-6-P, which is the second intermediate metabolite in glycolysis. 

Eukaryotic cells face a dilemma in providing suitable amounts of substrate for fatty acid synthesis. Sufficient quantities of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH must be generated in the cytosol for fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA is made by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, so the problem reduces to generating sufficient acetyl-CoA and NADPH. There are three principal sources of acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA derived from amino acid degradation is normally insufficient for fatty acid biosynthesis, and the acetyl-CoA produced by pyruvate dehydrogenase and by fatty acid oxidation cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane to participate directly in fatty acid synthesis. Instead, acetyl-CoA is linked  with  oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol by  citrate carriers (CIC),  nuclear-encoded proteins located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, members of the mitochondrial carrier family.  Biosynthesis of oxaloacetate requires  malate dehydrogenase enzymes or, in plants, pyruvate carboxylase enzymes.

So all these listed functional units and substrates are required in the synthesis process. They are essential, constituting a interdependent interlocked system of the cell.

As Bruce Alberts said in 1998, the biology of the future was going to be the study of molecular machines: “the entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines.”  One of those machines is like a mini-factory in itself. It’s called fatty acid synthase.

The first step of fatty acid biosynthesis requires the participation of  malonyl-CoA, a three-carbon intermediate.  The formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA is an irreversible process, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes. a multifunctional protein with 3 subunits, which is carefully regulated.

In the second step, fatty acid synthase ( FAS) proteins come into action. These are the little heroes of this article. FAS most striking feature is the “high degree of architectural complexity” – some 48 active sites, complete with moving parts

Which organism has one of the most elaborate fatty-acid machines of all?  The surprising answer: fungi. 
Perhaps the most striking feature of fungal FAS is its high degree of architectural complexity, in which 48 functional centers exist in a single ... particle.  Detailed structural information is essential for delineating how this complex particle coordinates the reactions involved in many steps of synthesis of fatty acids.... The six alpha subunits form a central wheel in the assembly, and the beta subunits form domes on the top and bottom of the wheel, creating six reaction chambers within which each Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) can reach the six active sites through surprisingly modest movements.

The crystal structure of yeast FAS reveals that this large, macromolecular assembly functions as a six-chambered reactor for fatty acid synthesis.  Each of the six chambers functions independently and has in its chamber wall all of the catalytic units required for fatty acid priming, elongation, and termination, while one substrate-shuttling component, ACP, is located inside each chamber and functions like a swinging arm.  Surprisingly, however, the step at which the reactor is activated must occur before the complete assembly of the particle since the PPT domain that attaches the pantetheine arm to ACP lies outside the assembly,inaccessible to ACP that lies inside.  Remarkably, the architectural complexity of the FAS particle results in the simplicity of the reaction mechanisms for fatty acid synthesis in fungi.

To imagine this level of precision and master-controlled processing on a level this small, cannot help but induce a profound sense of wonder and awe.  Here, all this time, this machine has been helping to keep living things functioning and we didn’t even know the details till now. 

The fatty acids are useless without the amino acids, and vice versa .  Even if some kind of metabolic cycle were to be envisioned under semi-realistic conditions, how did this elaborate machine, composed of amino acids with precise charge distributions, arise?  It’s not just the machine, it’s the blueprints and construction process that must be explained.  What blind process led to the precise placement of active sites that process their inputs in a programmed sequence?  What put them into a structure with shared walls where six reaction chambers can work independently?  All this complexity, involving thousands of precision amino acids in FAS  has to be coded in DNA, then built by the formidably complex translation process, then assembled together in the right order, or FAS won’t work.  But the storage, retrieval, translation and construction systems all need the fatty acids, too, or they won’t work.

We are witnessing an interdependent system of mind-boggling complexity that defies any explanation besides intelligent design.  Yes, Bruce Alberts, “as it turns out, we can walk and we can talk because the chemistry that makes life possible is much more elaborate and sophisticated than anything we students had ever considered.”  We have tended to “vastly underestimate the sophistication of many of these remarkable devices.”

The closer they look, the more wondrous the cell gets.  Who would have thought that the requirement to make these fatty acids would require machinery with moving parts and reaction chambers?  Who would have imagined their surfaces would be covered with complex proteins that regulate the production inside?  Who would have realized that fat was so important, the cell had complex assembly plants to build it?  Fat is almost a mild cussword in our vocabulary, but it is another class of molecular building blocks we couldn’t live without.  Fats, sugars, proteins and nucleic acids all work together in life, from humans to lowly fungi.  Each class of molecules has immense variety, each is essential, and each is manufactured to spec by precision machinery.  What a wonderful post-Darwinian world.

How do origin of life researchers envision the arise of these hyper complex nano factories and assembly lines to make fatty acids ? The scientific paper The lipid world says :

Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules into complex supramolecular structures is spontaneous. The plausibility that such structures were present in the prebiotic environment is supported by the occurrence of amphiphilic molecules in carbonaceous meteorites and the demonstration that they can assemble into membrane vesicles. 

This paper shows the helplessness of proponents of  natural prebiotic origin of lipids. Its a hudge gap between above explanation, and the arise of hypercomplex multyenzymatic proteins, which produce fatty acids through advanced, regulated, precise, coordinated multistep factory assembly-line like robotic  procedures. 

I conclude that the make of  essential fatty acids, ingredients of cell membranes, requires interdependent irreducible complex procedures,  several different metabolic pathways in order to make the substrates and produce the energy used in the process, several enzymes, the whole machinery to make the assembly proteins and enzymes. Since this constitutes a complex interlocked process, it could not be due to step by step evolutionary manner. Fatty acids, constituents of the cell membranes, had to exist right from the start for life to arise. This fact makes the design inference the most rational one.

498,Chimpanzee trace sequences,6,True,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3geadk/icr_study_finds_massive_chimphuman_genetic_gap/), one of the more prolific creationists here (/u/stcordova) made the claim that the similarity between Humans and Chimpanzees has been overstated because the actual Chimpanzee sequences obtained from the labs look nothing like the current consensus sequence (e.g. Feb. 2011 - panTro4) which he calls 'garbage'.

This claim seems to have originated from a [paper published](http://www.donotlink.com/gcsl) in 2011 by young earth creationist [Jeffrey Thomkins](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Tomkins). It was published in a non-peer reviewed creationist journal.

The original lab sequences can be obtained from the NCBI trace archive database - [here is a link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=species_code%3D%22PAN%20TROGLODYTES%22&dopt=fasta&size=47918250&dispmax=5&page=1&seeas=Show) to a search returning the sequences obtained directly from Chimpanzees.

In this post, I hope to put Jeffrey Thomkins' claims and the claims of /u/stcordova to the test.

First of all a word of caution about trace data taken directly from the labs:

1. There are graphs called chromatograms that go along with any given trace. These tell you how clean and reliable the data is for each base in that trace. [Here is a brief tutorial](http://seqcore.brcf.med.umich.edu/doc/dnaseq/interpret.html) on reading these. If the data for a given base is good, you should expect clean and evenly spaced peaks with a minimal amount of baseline noise. The chromatograms are available for all traces in the NCBI database. You will notice when looking at any chromatogram that they are messy and noisy at either end of the sequence but the peaks are clean and sharp near the middle. [Here is an example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=355302900&dopt=trace&color=on&size=1&seeas=Show) (scroll to the far left to see the results of 'dye blobs' affecting the read and scroll far to the right to see how the peaks weaken and become harder to see but take note how the data is clean and easy read in the center of the trace)

2. Apart from the first issue, there are also predictable errors that occur near the beginning and again at the end of any sequencing run.

Don't just take my word for it - it says so [right here](http://seqcore.brcf.med.umich.edu/doc/dnaseq/interpret.html): ""*Predictable errors occur near the beginning and again at the end of any sequencing run*"". So when joining two or more trace sequences that contain overlapping data, one needs to be aware that they will likely need to discard roughly 50 - 100 bases from both the beginning and the end of the trace which will contain nonsense data. It is easy to verify that this is the case and I will demonstrate this effect using trace sequences from the human genome.

[Here is a human trace](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=7873984&dopt=fasta&size=1&seeas=Show)

Select ""Show as Info"" to verify that it is from a human and try selecting ""Show as quality"" to see it's quality data. Notice how the quality is poor both at the beginning and the end of the trace while in the center it is acceptable.

I will now search for this trace against the consensus human genome. It has [one convincing result](http://jsbin.com/pakaweqali) but note that it only starts matching the consensus sequence (GRCh38) from nucleotide 27 onwards. Now let's [look at the alignment](http://jsbin.com/zeqaxacezo). Notice 1) how the first 27 nucleotides don't match anything (ctgaaattgc gggacagtag ttcatc), 2) Things start getting shakey towards the end of the trace as errors creep into the trace data.

You can repeat this experiment for any of the [275 million human traces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=species_code%3D%22Homo%20Sapiens%22&size=0&retrieve=Submit) found in the NCBI database and you will find that for the vast majority of them this same effect occurs: 1) Nonsense data at the beginning of the read and often at the end as well 2) We find an increasing amount of noise towards the end of the read.

[Here is another one for example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=40412396&dopt=fasta&size=1&retrieve=Submit): It convincingly [matches 1 location in the human genome with 96.6% identity](http://jsbin.com/cahepezepe) and [here is the alignment](http://jsbin.com/budilurane). Notice once again how there is nonsense at either end of the sequence that doesn't match anything (17 bases at the start and 76 bases at the end) and notice once again how errors tend to be clustered towards the end of the sequence.

It is easy to verify that these bits at the beginning and end of the sequence should be discarded because we can simply use a BLAST search against the NCBI trace database to look for overlapping sequences. As expected when we do this, we find that the overlapping trace reads do not contain this nonsense DNA. I will now illustrate this with some Chimpanzee trace data:

Here is a [Chimpanzee sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&cmd=retrieve&val=355302900&dopt=fasta&size=1&retrieve=Submit). If I run a BLAT search against panTro4, we find [a number of matching results this time](http://jsbin.com/wonowufuso) but almost all of them start matching at position 74 and don't match the last 118 nucleotides beyond position 955. [Here is the alignment](http://jsbin.com/qiyuwixexa) - notice once again the familiar pattern of nonsense at the beginning and end of the trace and a tendency for errors to cluster towards the end. Nevertheless it is 99.4% identical to the consensus Chimp sequence. Looking into why it found so many matches, I find the straight forward explanation: this trace is a piece of the [LINE element L1PA7](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=panTro4&position=chr7%3A125368959-125370286&hgsid=440747312_qoQPlBzqJfXvskYnVLW5W2CASD6M) and this LINE element is scattered in a number of places throughout the Chimpanzee genome.

I will now attempt to show that the first 74 bases are nonsense and have been rightly excluded from the consensus Chimpanzee sequence.

I will run a BLAST search through all 47 million traces in the NCBI database for a sequence that starts just after the first 74 nucleotides

So hopefully /u/stcordova now understands the issues with trace data. In spite of these issues it is still possible to show the the trace data maps well onto the consensus Chimpanzee sequence panTro4 and there is still a good match with the consensus Human sequence (GRCh38)

/u/stcordova if you don't believe me then my challenge to you now it to pick 5 of the 47,918,250 trace sequences - just give me 5 numbers from 1 to 47,918,250 and after making allowance for the nonsense at the beginning and end of trace sequences, I will illustrate that it still has a high similarity 95 - 99% to the Human sequence.

410,Evolution of the Kozak sequence to replace the Shine-Dalgarno sequence,2,True,"The story goes eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.  

Associated with the translation of proteins in prokaryotes is the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.

>The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic messenger RNA, generally located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG.[1] The RNA sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the mRNA to initiate protein synthesis by aligning the ribosome with the start codon.

>The Shine-Dalgarno sequence exists both in bacteria and archaea. It is also present in some chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts. The six-base consensus sequence is AGGAGG; in Escherichia coli, for example, the sequence is AGGAGGU, while subsequence GAGG dominates in E. coli virus T4 early genes.[1]

>The Shine-Dalgarno sequence was proposed by Australian scientists John Shine (b. 1946) and Lynn Dalgarno (b. 1935).


Contrast Shine-Dalgrano sequence in prokaryotes with the Kozak consensus sequence in Eukaryotes:

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozak_consensus_sequence

>The Kozak consensus sequence, Kozak consensus or Kozak sequence, is a sequence which occurs on eukaryotic mRNA and has the consensus (gcc)gccRccAUGG. The Kozak consensus sequence plays a major role in the initiation of the translation process.[1] The sequence was named after the person who brought it to prominence, Marilyn Kozak.

If the Shine-Dalgrano was working so good, why did it evolve into the Kozak consensus sequence?  

And it bears pointing out, the Shine-Dalgrano sequence is present in so many translation initiation sites.  One can't just mutate one of them in order to make it a Kozak type sequence, one has to mutate all or most of them.

One can't just cite the fact eukaryotic mitochondira have some Shine-Dalgrano sequences.  Proteins shared between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in the nuclear DNA but with Kozak vs. Shine-Dalgrano sequences need some explanation for macroevolution to be plausible.  


PS
One thing we also know that the Kozak sequence is part of the UTR (untranslated regions) which may actually be translated.  See:

411,Evolutionists are evolution deniers,0,True,"When I raise certain topics like say ""the evolution of stop codon prior to the existence of stop codons"", evolutionists will often respond, ""that's an origin of life issue, and evolution doesn't deal with that.""

OK, so then it appears evolutionists deny that evolution had a role in certain features of life, especially those critical to basic functioning of life -- features that are pretty important!

Is that because:

A  evolution can't explain origin of life, never will

B  evolution isn't responsible for those features associated with the origin of life

C  just a convenient relabeling 

D  other (explain)

If one says it's just a relabeling, then does this mean evolution can't explain it or does that mean some mechanism other than evolution was involved?  In either case, it's denying evolution had a role in the emergence of such features, or at the very least evolution has no credible answers.

If one says evolution doesn't apply to the origin of life, then that is a denial that evolution had a role in features we associate with the origin of life such as say the evolution of tRNA-synthetases before tRNA-synthetases existed.

This is pretty strong evidence that a planning intelligence is required to set it up.[/b][/color]

A critically important macromolecule—arguably “second in importance only to DNA”—is ATP. As far as known, all organisms from the simplest bacteria to humans use ATP as their primary energy currency. ATP contains the purine base adenine and the sugar ribose which together form the nucleoside adenosine. Adenine is one of the most important organic molecules for life as we know it today. ""Adenine synthesis is perhaps the best example of an irreducibly complex system that can be found in life ..."" the process doesn't work unless all 11 enzymes are present.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2137-atp-the-energy-currency-for-the-cell#3825

Adenine would never accumulate in any kind of ""prebiotic soup.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2028-origin-of-the-dna-double-helix#3435

In eukaryotes the mitochondria produce most of the cell’s ATP (anaerobic glycolysis also produces some)   The systems most frequently mentioned as irreducible complex, as the flagellum, have about 40 essential proteins.

ATP is only one of hundreds of thousands of essential molecules in eukaryotic cells. That makes the cell a hudge, enormous , unimaginable irreducible, interlocked, interdependent nano factory of incredible complexity.A few essential proteins and molecules are mentioned here :

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2085-essential-parts-proteins-enzymes-organelles-and-functions-in-the-cell?highlight=essential

This list is supposed to grow upon further investigation. We know only four basic methods of producing ATP: in bacterial cell walls, in the cytoplasm by photosynthesis, in chloroplasts, and in mitochondria. No transitional forms exist to bridge these four methods by evolution. According to the concept of irreducible complexity, these ATP producing machines must have been manufactured as functioning units and they could not have evolved by Darwinism mechanisms. Anything less than an entire ATP molecule will not function and a manufacturing plant which is less than complete cannot produce a functioning ATP. Some believe that the field of biochemistry which has achieved this understanding has already falsified the Darwinian world view (Behe, 1996).  It certainly looks like the numerous enzymes and carrier proteins needed for cellular respiration demonstrates irreducible complexity. not only does there have to be enough of each of the enzymes and carrier proteins present but they must also work in the right order and be effective enough as well. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and a machine is only as efficient as its slowest part. Given what we know about how life actually works and how easily it dies when it doesn't have enough energy, it is evident that for cellular respiration to have developed naturally within living organisms that could reproduce, would have required several simultaneous innovations. Some scientists have argued that the positions of intelligent design and irreducible complexity are arguments from ignorance which lack enough imagination. I would submit that the concerns put forth above are based, not on ignorance, but on what we actually do know about how life actually works and how easily it dies. Just as a car can die from not having enough gas for energy, or oil for seizing parts, or anti-freeze for engine overheating, so too, all physicians know that there are many different pathways to death. If you really want to begin to understand how life came into existence, you first have to understand how easily it can become non-existent.

The Transport of Proteins into Mitochondria

Mitochondria are double-membrane-enclosed organelles. They specialize in ATP synthesis, using energy derived from electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and from photosynthesis in chloroplasts . Although both organelles contain their own DNA, ribosomes, and other components required for protein synthesis, most of their proteins are encoded in the cell nucleus and imported from the cytosol.

If the endosymbiosis theory were true, would the proteins not keep being encoded and produced all inside mitochondria ? 

Most organelle proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm from nuclear encoded mRNAs. These proteins must be imported into mitochondria. Special sequences, called signal sequences, target the protein to its proper organelle. Organelles contain protein translocator complexes that are required for this transport.

Key players in this process are proteins, a signal sequence, chaperonins, ATP, protein translocator complexes, and signal peptidase.

In order for  proteins required inside of mitochondria being able to arrive at their destination, following is required :

All the machinery to synthesize mRNA's
Cytoplasm and the container of it ( the cell membrane )
the ribosome to make proteins
proteins
signal sequences
chaperonins
ATP,
protein translocator complexes required for the transport
signal peptidase
and the organelle ( the mitochondrion ) into which the protein is transported

if any of it is missing, nothing goes. That is a irreducible , interlocked and interdependent system, which indicates that all the organelles and machinery had to emerge simultaneously. A separate independent stepwise arise is not possible.

Proteins destined for transport into mitochondria contain a signal sequence. This sequence acts as a targeting mechanism to ensure the protein is delivered to the proper organelle.

Most signal-relay stations we know about were intelligently designed. Signal without recognition is meaningless.  Communication implies a signalling convention (a “coming together” or agreement in advance) that a given signal means or represents something: e.g., that S-O-S means “Send Help!”   The transmitter and receiver can be made of non-sentient materials, but the functional purpose of the system always comes from a mind.  The mind uses the material substances to perform an algorithm that is not itself a product of the materials or the blind forces acting on them.  Signal sequences may be composed of mindless matter, but they are marks of a mind behind the intelligent design.

In the mitochondrial electron-transport chain, six different cytochrome hemes, eight iron–sulfur clusters, three copper atoms, a flavin mononucleotide (another electron-transfer cofactor), and ubiquinone work in a defined sequence to carry electrons from NADH to O2. In total, this pathway involves more than 60 different polypeptides arranged in three large membrane protein complexes, each of which binds several of the above electron-carrying cofactors.

It now appears that the we have  trillions of mechanical devices similar like those coupling rods.  They serve to transmit the energy in the food we eat into mechanical energy, driving a proton pump inside the mitochondrion.  It’s all part of an amazing series of electromechanical machines in the powerhouses of the cell. A special type of „transmission element“, which is not known from any other protein, appears to be responsible for the energy transduction within the complex by mechanical nanoscale coupling. Transferred to the technical world, this could be described as a power transmission by a coupling rod, which connects for instance the wheels of a steam train.

Did life really come about solely by random chemicals coming together to form cells, then simple organisms, and then complex ones like us? In other words, without a mind at work to make it happen? Do you think that the over twenty different enzymes and carrier proteins, each consisting of over 300 amino acids, just happened to come together in a specific pathway, called cellular respiration, to provide our cells with the energy they need to live? No, when it comes to the origin of life it seems to me that Science still has a lot of explaining to do. Meanwhile, as we wait for evolutionary biologists to admit the deficiencies within their theory, our children and the whole world continue to be misled!

Here, we estimate the combinatorics of self-assembling the protein constituents of a yeast cell, a number so vast that the functional interactome could only have emerged by iterative hierarchic assembly of its component sub-assemblies. A protein can undergo both reversible denaturation and hierarchic self-assembly spontaneously, but a functioning interactome must expend energy to achieve viability. Consequently, it is implausible that a completely “denatured” cell could be reversibly renatured spontaneously, like a protein. Instead, new cells are generated by the division of pre-existing cells, an unbroken chain of renewal tracking back through contingent conditions and evolving responses to the origin of life on the prebiotic earth. We surmise that this non-deterministic temporal continuum could not be reconstructed de novo under present conditions.
...
>perhaps the most profound conclusion to be drawn from our calculations of combinatorial complexity is that the emergent interactome could not have self-organized spontaneously from its isolated protein components. Rather, it attains its functional state by templating the interactome of a mother cell and maintains that state by a continuous expenditure of energy. In the absence of a prior framework of existing interactions, it is far more likely that combined cellular constituents would end up in a non-functional, aggregated state, one incompatible with life. Even the recent successful creation of an artificial bacterial cell36 only demonstrates that synthetic genetic material can be transplanted into the cytoplasm (i.e., the viable interactome) of a very closely related bacterium. The spontaneous origination of a de novo cell has yet to be observed; all extant cells are generated by the division of pre-existing cells that provide the necessary template for perpetuation of the interactome.


What this means is there are non-Mendelian heritable factors that are templated from a pre-existing interactome not just from the DNA.

For starters, since neo-Darwinian modern Synthesis is an unhappy marriage of the good science of Mendelian genetics and the speculative ""science"" of Darwinian ideas,  this non-Mendelian feature of biology would seem now to invalidate lots of Neo-Darwinism.

DNA focuses information into highly localized regions.  For example, if I wanted to know what part of the DNA codes for Cytochrome-C,  I can get a good estimate of the all the exon loci on a DNA that participate in coding Cytochrome-C in eukaryotes and an almost exact if not exact location of the coding loci in a given prokaryote (which don't have exons).

In contrast, since the interactome is separately implemented as numerous copies in numerous parts of the cell, to change the interactome, one has to simultaneously change identical parts in ALL parts of the cell.  

For lack of a better word, I will use the word ""mutation"" to change the interactome, but these mutations would have to be simultaneous in all or most parts of the cell in order to resist the apparent deep redundancy in the interactome.  

The redundancy prevents too much of a fundamental change in the cell architecture despite modest injury.  How do we know this?

When we fire DNA bullets using Gene Guns into the cell in order to change the DNA, the damage to the cytoplasm is recoverable, yet it is in the cytoplasm lots of interactome activity is happening and it is this very interactome that serves as a reproductive template for descendent cell lines.  

We tend to think the information in the interactome may not count that much since we can damage parts of the cell and the cell self heals, whereas the reality is that the information is so deeply redundant in the interactome that self-healing is possible and that the information in the interactome is not localized like the information in DNA.

Conclusion, gradual change to basic form is not possible.  Not only are there not smooth gradual changes possible in evolving one highly specific protein to another highly specific protein, even moreso, the interactome cannot change gradually especially since it is redundantly copied in so many parts of the cell that it allows cells the ability to self heal.

Self-healing means that a pre-existing template somewhere is referenced to do a reconstruction.  If one interactome part (say part A) is injured, then other interactome parts (say parts B,C....ZZZZ) host the information to rebuild it (part A). 

Given this complication, de novo changes are not that feasible since they would require many simultaneous changes rather than step-wise changes claimed by evolutionary theory.",1439052518,0,2015-08-08 12:48:38

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2128-membrane-structure#3798

According to this website : The Interdependency of Lipid Membranes and Membrane Proteins
The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. The interdependency of lipid membranes and membrane proteins suggests that lipid bilayers and membrane proteins co-evolved together with membrane bioenergetics.

The nonsense of this assertion is evident. How could the membrane proteins co-evolve, if they had to be manufactured in the machinery , protected by the cell membrane ? 

The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. 

The ER and Golgi apparatus together constitute the endomembrane compartment in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The endomembrane compartment is a major site of lipid synthesis, and the ER is where not only lipids are synthesized, but membrane-bound proteins and secretory proteins are also made. 

So in order to make cell membranes, the Endoplasmic Recticulum is required. But also the Golgi Apparatus, the peroxysome, and the mitochondria. But these only function, if protected and encapsulated in the cell membrane. What came first, the cell membrane, or the endoplasmic recticulum ? This is one of many other catch22 situations in the cell, which indicate that the cell could not emerge in a stepwise gradual manner, as proponents of natural mechanisms want to make us believe.

Not only is the cell membrane intricate and complex (and certainly not random), but it has tuning parameters such as the degree to which the phospholipid tails are saturated. It is another example of a sophisticated biological design about which evolutionists can only speculate. Random mutations must have luckily assembled molecular mechanisms which sense environmental challenges and respond to them by altering the phospholipid population in the membrane in just the right way. Such designs are tremendously helpful so of course they would have been preserved by natural selection. It is yet another example of how silly evolutionary theory is in light of scientific facts.",1438664025,5,2015-08-04 00:53:45

Some highlights:
>from Stephen C. Meyers book : Darwin's doubt : 


>The Sugar Code 

>Biologists know of an additional source of epigenetic information stored in the arrangement of sugar  molecules on the exterior surface of the cell membrane. Sugars can be attached to the lipid molecules that make up the membrane itself (in which case they are called ""glycolipids""), or they can be attached to the proteins embedded in the membrane (in which case they are called ""glycoproteins""). Since simple sugars can be combined in many more ways than amino acids, which make up proteins, the resulting cell surface patterns can be enormously complex. As biologist Ronald Schnaar explains, ""Each [sugar] building block can assume several different positions. It is as if an A could serve as four different letters, depending on whether it was standing upright, turned upside down, or laid on either of its sides. In fact, seven simple sugars can be rearranged to form hundreds of thousands of  unique words, most of which have no more than five letters.""

>These sequence-specific information-rich structures influence the arrangement of different cell types during embryological development. Thus, some cell biologists now refer to the arrangements of sugar molecules as the ""sugar code"" and compare these sequences to the digitally encoded information stored in DNA. As biochemist Hans-Joachim Gabius notes, sugars provide a system  with ""high-density coding"" that is ""essential to allow cells to communicate efficiently and swiftly  through complex surface interactions.""26 According to Gabius, ""These [sugar] molecules surpass amino acids and nucleotides by far in information-storing capacity."" 1 So the precisely arranged sugar  molecules on the surface of cells clearly represent another source of information independent of that stored in DNA base sequences. 

>NEO-DARWINISM AND THE CHALLENGE OF EPIGENETIC INFORMATION 

>These different sources of epigenetic information in embryonic cells pose an enormous challenge to  the sufficiency of the neo-Darwinian mechanism. According to neo-Darwinism, new information, form, and structure arise from natural selection acting on random mutations arising at a very low level within the biological hierarchy—within the genetic text. Yet both body-plan formation during embryological development and major morphological innovation during the history of life depend upon a specificity of arrangement at a much higher level of the organizational hierarchy, a level that DNA alone does not determine. If DNA isn't wholly responsible for the way an embryo develops— for body-plan morphogenesis—then DNA sequences can mutate indefinitely and still not produce a new body plan, regardless of the amount of time and the number of mutational trials available to the evolutionary process. Genetic mutations are simply the wrong tool for the job at hand.  Even in a best-case scenario—one that ignores the immense improbability of generating new genes by mutation and selection—mutations in DNA sequence would merely produce new genetic information. But building a new body plan requires more than just genetic information. It requires both genetic and epigenetic information—information by definition that is not stored in DNA and thus cannot be generated by mutations to the DNA. It follows that the mechanism of natural selection acting on random mutations in DNA cannot by itself generate novel body plans, such as those that first arose in the Cambrian explosion.

420,On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation,5,True,"On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation

Just five nucleobases, also termed the genetic alphabet, are known to dominate the composition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) 

The quest of the origin of the coded information stored in DNA is a unresolved problem .

Lee Strobel writes:

“The six feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made … No hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means” (Strobel, p. 282).

However, not only must the specified complex arrangement of the nucleotides stored in DNA be explained, which are the information required to make proteins, but also the origin of the basepairs itself and why only four bases, aka letters were selected, that is, the narrow selection of restricted variety of organic molecules upon which life is based. That is, in the same manner as not only the origin of the poem written through a alphabet might have to be figured out, but the origin of the alphabet itself, that is in our case, why four, and not more or less nucleobases, but also why these four types, that is, why not different nucleobases since there are miriads from which the code could be chosen from. But also, why the assignment at all, rather than none ? Why arised a code, rather than none ? That is not a trivial question, but a fundamental one, which hardly can find good explanations through naturalism, however if a mind is involved, it makes perfect sense, since we know of minds inventing various kinds of alphabets all the time, there are european, asian, russian , japanese, chinese etc. types of alphabets. 

In the paper : On the Origin of the Canonical Nucleobases: An Assessment of Selection Pressures across Chemical and Early Biological Evolution, the author asks : How did nature “decide” upon these specific heterocycles? ( A heterocyclic compound or ring structure is a cyclic compound that has atoms of at least two different elements as members of its ring(s) ) Evidence suggests that many types of heterocycles could have been present on the early Earth. 

the paper continues : The prebiotic formation of polymeric nucleic acids employing the native bases remains, however, a challenging problem to reconcile. 

Hypotheses have proposed that the emerging RNA world may have included many types of nucleobases. This is supported by the extensive utilization of non-canonical nucleobases in extant RNA and the resemblance of many of the modified bases to heterocycles generated in simulated prebiotic chemistry experiments.

So basically, there is no reason why the four extant nucleobases are selected. Any other could be assigned. But then there could be 4, 6, 10 or eventually even more nucleobases to form the language with alphabet, grammar, collection of punctuation marks and regulatory sites, semantics. . This remains a challenging problem for naturalism, not however for intelligent design, where a intelligent designer selected arbitrarly the four bases to create life. 

The authors try to answer the question, stating following : Two such selection pressures may have been related to genetic fidelity and duplex stability ( of the DNA double helix ). Clearly, the considerations applicable to potential prebiotic synthetic pathways do not appear to provide much insight into the selection of the bases of interest. We have not taken into account, however, stability, which is considered by many to be the more important factor regarding prebiotic abundance.

Since when did a prebiotic environment establish "" selection pressures "", and why and how should there have been such goal to reach genetic fidelity and duplex stability ? There is triple stranded DNA, and it has nice stability........ In the paper:

Stable triple-stranded DNA formation and its application to the SNP detection, the authors state :

We have found that a short stretch (30mer or larger) of triple-stranded DNA structure formed at the terminus (or very near) of linear DNA molecules is unusually stable, withstanding heat treatment at as high as 95 degrees C. 

And the base pairs are also different :

The Hoogsteen base pair, consisting of a syn adenine base paired with an anti thymine base, is found in the 2.1 Å resolution structure of the MATα2 homeodomain bound to DNA in a region where a specifically and a non‐specifically bound homeodomain contact overlapping sites. 

The paper then continues : the alphabetic composition is the product of a continual process of refinement that evolved to its current state. 

The only problem with this assertion is that they make things up. How do they know the state of affairs was due to evolution ? They don't know. Atheists however will immediately conclude, because the paper says so, it must be true....... 

Results from simulated prebiotic chemistry experiments conducted over the past fifty years and the ongoing analysis of meteorites provide evidence that not only the native bases were likely present on the early Earth, but so were many others. 

So that means, life had many options, but choose to select just the extant four bases. The authors continue : 

It would seem reasonable to hypothesize that the bases used by nature would have been selected to exhibit some of the highest stabilities against these spontaneous deamination reactions in comparison to alternative nucleobases. 

Here applies the same as said above: Since when did a prebiotic environment establish "" selection pressures "", and why and how should there have been a goal to reach highest stability against these spontaneous deamination reactions in comparison to alternative nucleobases ? It seems almost as if nature had the goal to create life ? 

The authors go on:

Greater persistence in this environment would have given the native bases an advantage over others, possibility facilitating their selective incorporation into the first primitive genetic polymers. 

Again : nature has no mental forsight, and no goals. And so it really does not matter at all, if primitive genetic polymers would have been produced, or not.

>Although some pseudogenes such as LINEs and Alus appear to be hierarchically shared between primates, others clearly are not. An example of such a discordancy is the sharing of SINE elements between evolutionarily more-distant organisms to the exclusion of animals of intermediate evolutionary derivation, despite the presence of intact homologous genetic loci in the latter.

>Pseudogene sequences are frequently exchanged. This complicates any interpretation of phylogeny.

>One evolutionary tenet is that pseudogenes such as SINEs and LINEs insert randomly. The independent insertion of such sequences in the genomes of two clearly unrelated animals should therefore be virtually impossible. So the presence of identical sequences at homologous sites in the genomes of two organisms unquestionably indicates common ancestry. However, the independent acquisition of both LINE and SINE elements at the exact site in different animals has now been demonstrated. Moreover, it has now been shown that these elements have insertion hotspots at specific DNA sequences, and at chromosomal cleavage/break sites in bent or coiled DNA.

Actually, mainly this one:

>12] Macro-evolution is nothing but lots and lots of “micro-evolution”!

>Such a point of view is simply untenable, and it denotes a complete misunderstanding of the nature of function. Macroevolution, in all its possible meanings, implies the emergence of new complex functions. A function is not the simplistic sum of a great number of “elementary” sub-functions: sub-functions have to be interfaced and coherently integrated to give a smoothly performing whole. In the same way, macroevolution is not the mere sum of elementary microevolutionary events.

>A computer program, for instance, is not the sum of simple instructions. Even if it is composed ultimately of simple instructions, the information-processing capacity of the software depends on the special, complex order of those instructions. You will never obtain a complex computer program by randomly assembling elementary instructions or modules of such instructions

>In the same way, macroevolution cannot be a linear, simple or random accumulation of microevolutionary steps.

>Microevolution, in all its known examples (antibiotic resistance, and similar) is made of simple variations, which are selectable for the immediate advantage connected to them. But a new functional protein cannot be built by simple selectable variations, no more than a poem can be created by random variations of single letters, or a software written by a sequence of elementary (bit-like) random variations, each of them improving the “function” of the software.

>Function simply does not work that way. Function derives from higher levels of order and connection, which cannot emerge from a random accumulation of micro-variations. As the complexity (number of bits) of the functional sequence increases, the search space increases exponentially, rapidly denying any chance of random exploration of the space itself.

That story is almost plausible until one is confronted with large numbers of orphan genes in each species.  We know, based on statistics and probability how difficult it would be to evolve a new functioning protein cascade rich with the appropriate regulatory features.  If new genes pop up in various species rapidly, absurdly fast evolutionary mechanisms would be in play, perhaps so fast they become indistinguishable from special creation.

Here are some evolutionary biologists describing the problem:

>If the orphans represent valid human protein-coding genes, we would have to conclude that the vast majority of the orphans were born after the divergence from chimpanzee. Such a model would require a prodigious rate of gene birth in mammalian lineages and a ferocious rate of gene death erasing the huge number of genes born before the divergence from chimpanzee. We reject such a model as wholly implausible.

We show that poor sequence or assembly quality is not a major contributor to this high representation by orphan genes.** Moreover, most unannotated sequences are functional: a microarray experiment demonstrates that 59% of functional ESTs are unannotated.

>Abstract

>Because bacteria, archaea, and eukarya contain unique mosaics of genetic features and biochemical similarities, it has been notoriously difficult for evolutionists to infer the molecular biological properties of a first or last eukaryotic common ancestor. Eukarya share similarities to both domains of prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) while also exhibiting many innovative molecular features found in neither. Nevertheless, evolutionists postulate that some sort of mythical bacterial-archaeal precursor gave rise to the first eukaryotic cell. In a previous report, we showed that a vast chasm exists between archaea and eukarya in regard to basic molecular machines involved in DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein translation. The differences in information processing mechanisms and systems are even greater between bacteria and eukarya, which we elaborate upon in this report. Based on differences in lineage-specific essential gene sets and in the vital molecular machines between bacteria and eukarya, we continue to demonstrate that the same unbridgeable evolutionary chasms exist—further invalidating the myth of eukaryogenesis.

427,2nd Law of Thermodynamics doesn't preclude evolution,0,True,"A warm living human has substantially more thermodynamic entropy than a lifeless ice cube.  This can be demonstrated by taking the standard molar entropies of water and ice and estimating the entropy of water in a warm living human vs entropy of water in a lifeless ice cube.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(data_page)

Std Molar Entropy liquid water: 69.95 J/mol/K

Std Molar Entropy ice:  41 J/mol/K

A human has more liquid water, say 30 liters, than an ice cube (12 milliliters).

Order of magnitude entropy numbers:

S_human >  30 liters * 55.6 mol/liter * 69.95 J/K = 116,677 J/K

S_ice cube ~= 0.012 liters * 55.6 mol/liter * 41 J/K = 27 J/K approximately (ice is a little less dense than liquid water, but this is inconsequential for the question at hand).

Thus warm living human has more entropy than a lifeless cube of ice.

So why do creationists worry about entropy increasing in the universe as precluding evolution?  Given that a warm living human has more entropy than an ice cube, then it would seem there are lots of cases where MORE entropy is beneficial.

>Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs) from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications. Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth, longevity, pathology, and metabolism. In addition, more targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability.

>Author Summary

>It is widely believed that the most evolutionarily conserved DNA sequences in the human genome have been preserved because of their functional importance and that their removal would thus have a devastating effect on the organism. To ascertain this we removed from the mouse genome four ultraconserved elementsÃ¢â‚¬â€sequences of 200 base pairs or longer that are 100% identical among human, mouse, and rat. To our surprise, we found that the mice lacking these elements are viable, fertile, and show no apparent abnormalities. This completely unexpected finding indicates that extreme levels of DNA sequence conservation are not necessarily indicative of an indispensable functional nature. 

And from biophysicist Cornelius Hunter who pointed out the commonly accepted evolutionary belief was that that Histones composition was deeply ""conserved"" by natural selection because variation would prove lethal.  It turns out, this has been experimentally refuted:

>There was only one problem. That is false. In fact, even at the time studies had already shown that histone H4 could well tolerate many changes. It was not merely an example of evolution pointing in the wrong direction and producing yet another failed prediction. It was an all too frequent example of evolution abusing science, force-fitting results into its framework.

There is a further problem, when we are talking non-coding regions (such as in the mice), selection only has so many population resources throw at maintaining ""conservation"" in the non-coding regions.

Atheist bio-chemist Larry Moran and developmental biologist PZ Myers indirectly agreed with me that most molecular evolution must as matter of principle be free of selection based on straightforward textbook population genetics.

I summarized in the link below the reasons that most evolution must be selection free by taking the Poisson distribution and the derivations of respected geneticists like Kimura, Eye-Walker, Keitley, Nachman, Crowell, Herman Muller, etc.

Since it seems to be that way it must have happened that way. 

Furthermore, the fossil record supports this idea, being that many extinct creatures found provide missing links in between types of creatures. In addition, speciation by the slow process of natural selection combined with descent by modification has been observed with bacteria. Therefore, since it could have happened happened that way and, as far as we know, it looks like it happened that way, it must have happened that way.

434,Human males superior to females according to Darwinism?,0,True,"Since there is more competition in tournament species among males, isn't there more selection pressure on male traits?  See:
http://www.scimonkey.org/psycology/why-men-are-more-aggressive-than-women-tournament-and-pair-bonding-species/

This would suggest traits like:

1. strength

2. speed

3. intelligence

are under more selection pressure in males than the same traits in females.  

If males are under more selection pressure, wouldn't this, under the terms of Darwinian evolution, imply that males ought to evolve faster than females to be:

1. stronger
2. faster
3. smarter

This was Darwin's view.

>The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shewn by man’s attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman—whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands. If two lists were made of the most eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music (inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science, and philosophy, with half-a-dozen names under each subject, the two lists would not bear comparison. We may also infer, from the law of the deviation from averages, so well illustrated by Mr. Galton, in his work on ‘Hereditary Genius,’ that if men are capable of a decided pre-eminence over women in many subjects, the average of mental power in man must be above that of woman.

But why, according to Darwinian selection, is Darwin wrong?

From this peer reviewed article at the National Center for Biotechnology archive:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12680306


>A review of the prominent late 19th-century biological writings reveals that a major plank of early evolution theory was the belief that women were intellectually and physically inferior to men. Female inferiority was a logical conclusion of the Darwinian world view because males were believed to be exposed to far greater selective pressures than females, especially in war, competition for mates, food and clothing. Conversely, women were protected from selection by norms that required adult males provide for and protect women and children. Darwinists taught that as a result of this protection, natural selection operated far more actively on males than on females, producing male superiority in virtually all intellectual and skill areas. As a result, males became ""more evolved"" than women. The women inferiority doctrine is an excellent example of the fact that armchair logic often has been more important in building Darwinism than fossil and other empirical evidence.

I'm posting this here to continue a discussion I'm having with /u/JoeCoder on /r/Creation. While I will continue to comment on things I see pop up in /r/Creation from time to time, I've decided that it isn't worth my while debating there for two reasons

 - *Reason removed at /u/JoeCoder's request*

 - I'm happy to debate creationists if it is fruitful and others can learn something from the discussion. Unfortunately /r/Creation is a closed subreddit so the chances to share what I've learnt with people that are open to it are limited.

In light of these two points I will be moving all further discussions I have with creationists to open subreddits like this one and I will be critiquing creationist blog posts on /r/junkscience where creationists are welcome to dialogue with me further.

There was a question of the evidence for common descent from shared ERVs and I was invited to give my views. Below is my response:

442,I'm in an argument about evolution/mutation and I need a second opinion.,2,True,"Firstly, I apologize if this is against reddit ' rules for the board since this is my first reddit post, but I didn't really know where else to turn to for a quick second opinion on the matter.

I recently got into a conversation with someone whom I thought was inaccuratly representing evolution and mutation, and I thought I represented it well, until he accused me of addressing thing things he never said. I found this odd since I thought I was on point, so I would like it if someone here could read the conversation and tell me if I'm wrong, and where, or if this guy is just blowing smoke.

Before I post the full conversation I will say that I did use a wikipedia definition of something because I don't use the term ""purine base"" in my everyday life so I had to look some stuff up and that I agree with him that posting links to Berkeley's evolution 101 page was needlessly condicending. Okay here's the conversation:

Him:
""""And evolution IS mutation, mutation that ends up proving beneficial and is carried over from generation to generation.""

I have seen studies that point out that accidental mutation is not a part of evolution. Life has hidden properties that allows our kinds to change and adopt to the environment, most of which are not so apparent as things like skincolor, but they exist and are active. 
All mutation experiments that have ever been done all point out a universal law: mutation decreases fertility. At a certain point all organisms will lose their fertility if they go over the red line in their gene pool and die out. Be it by cross breading, chemical or radioactive mutation. A lack of diversity within your own species also innevitable result in mutation.""

Me:
""
If by ""accidental mutation"" you mean mutations that are the result of
external forces changing your genetic code(radiation, chemicals), then 
yeah, that can lead to infertility and cancer. The thing is, that isn't 
part of evolution, but errors when cells reproduce DNA are part of 
evolution, and it's this kind of mutation, most commonly called ""random 
mutation"", that people are referring to when they are talking about 
mutation with respect to evolution.

Also, your 
claims about mutation decreasing fertility are wrong. We know of genes 
that increase fertility in women; some of them are being studied in 
cancer research because they have been linked to increased instances of 
breast cancer. We also know that all of our genes are the result 
mutation after mutation, building up from the first organism to the 
currently level of genetic diversity we see today, so if mutations 
decreased fertility, we would have died out long ago, especially when 
you consider that there are about 128 mutations per human zygote.""

Him:
""

There is no such thing as non-accidental non-external mutation. The whole idea of the theory of evolution is that accidental mutations lead to benefitial abilities, and don't you even try to deny that. 
Mutation is mutation and an organism would never mutate it's offspring on it's own volition without error involved. Infertility is more than just a hormone inbalance. What you are refering to there is the workings of fertility related to genetic research on organisms that have not yet mutated outside of the pool limit.
I will bet you my right arm that the research you are referring too has been done on regular human beings, and not on freaks of nature. Mostly for the reason that each of those are unique, hard to compare (making these studies much more difficult and hard to find funding for). So, i am sorry to dissapoint you, but my statement stands: Mutation too far out of the gene pool of a species leads to irrevocable infertility.

""There is no such thing as non-accidental non-external mutation. Mutation
is mutation and an organism would never mutate it's offspring on it's 
own volition without error involved.""

No, there are several different kinds of spontaneous mutation that are involved with errors with replication of DNA, such as the change in position of a hydrogen atom to create a new base or the loss of a purine base, that arn't the result. Also, stop assigning intent to mutation since it isn't voluntary, it happens on the molecular level.

""Infertility is more than just a hormone inbalance. What you are refering
to there is the workings of fertility related to genetic research on 
organisms that have not yet mutated outside of the pool limit.""

I will agree that infertility is often more than just an imbalance of hormones, the problem with this statement is that I never said it was. I was using that as an example of fertility increasing genes to counter your statement that there are no mutations that result in increased fertility, since we would have had to mutate that gene sequence at some point.

""I will bet you my right arm that the research you are referring too has 
been done on regular human beings, and not on freaks of nature. Mostly 
for the reason that each of those are unique, hard to compare (making 
them less than ideal for scientific studies).So i am sorry to dissapoint you, but my statement stands: Mutation too far out of the gene pool of a species leads to irrevocable infertility.""

Freaks of nature? In the context of your ""gene pool limits"" you keep referring to, I'm assuming you're talking about people who have evolved so far outside the base human gene pool that they are considered a new species. Thing is, on an individual level one cannot evolve into a new species in a single generation, but one can be born with genes that render oneself infertile from birth, but is still a part of our species. I also went ahead and tried to find research on ""gene pool limits"", but I can't seem to find anything that you might be referring to. So you'd have to provide whatever research you're working with before you'll convince me or any other sceptically-minded person what your saying is true.

""Also another little factoid for the Evolution-fans out there: 
Cooperation is the most sufficient way of survival for all forms of 
life; NOT survival of the fittest!""

Cooperation is a great survival technique, but your problem here is in the assumption that cooperation is separate from evolution and the struggle to be the ""fittest""(even though that's misleading, what that really means is ""most well adapted to one's environmental niche""). Cooperation is an evolutionary byproduct, just look at the human face. Humans have the most complex social interactions of any of the apes we have studied, and we also have more facial muscles that allow us to be much more expressive through our facial gestures. When we compare this to our closest relatives, the chimps, we see that not only do they have less ability to make facial gestures but they also have much simpler social behaviors than we do. I'm not saying this is the the sole reason why humans are much more social creatures than anything else, there are far more neurological and morphological reasons for that as well, I'm just saying that this is compelling evidence that cooperation and socialization are the result of millions of evolution, and not separate from it as you seem to suggest.

I'm going to leave you with a couple of links to information sites about genetics and evolution so you can read up on these subjects.""

Him:
""Hey there, you don't need to explain to me how cells mutate, i can read Wikipedia too!

Now as a final statement i would like to share with you that in contrast to what you probably thought; i am not a creationist. Not in the Christian sense anyway. I am simply not in agreance with the popular 'scientific' standpoint on how life has evolved into what we experience around us. I think almost all of it which is so proudly presented as absolute undiable fact in so many school text books is totally speculated and is a science that has barely barely made it out of the womb, compared to it's actual depth and complexity. 
I don't think our general level of knowledge allows us to understand it yet as, modern society sinks into deeper and deeper apathy towards new data that breaks the old paradigmes. Everyone is sick of everything and noone trusts anything to be true. Most people are losing their sense of discernment. I am not one of these people.

450,Three problems with the theory of evolution...,0,True,"In another debate sub the claim was made that humans evolved through natural processes.  It was met with the following objections and because this could turn into a whole new debate I decided to post them here for further discussion on these particular claims because this forum is more appropriate.  Can anyone weigh in on these proposed problems with evolution:

--Problem number 1-- 

25 years ago Richard Lenski began an experiment which is still going. He has watched 50,000 generations of bacteria that he has subjected to differing conditions, and recorded all the changes in their genes that enable them to survive. But at the end of the day that bacteria are still bacteria, it hasn't evolved into a fundamentally different organism.

--Problem number 2--

Let’s look at this basic scenario involving a fish (when I say fish I mean a fish population, so I am not speaking of an individual) and let’s say it finds a bit of food near above the surface of the water near land. This would be a selection pressure – more abundant food near the water’s edge. In order to get this food it needs to push itself up a bit to with its fin. Thus, like the finch’s beak, the fin changes. Over time digits develop for better grip. A joint may develop for better leverage or longer reach. Since it can get more food the longer it stays out of the water, lungs develop.

But how does all of the following happen in the same time frame via an impersonal, unguided, purposeless process?

How do the...

1) weight bearing feet, legs, and accompanying joints develop from non-weight bearing fins;

2) lungs develop from gills;

3) skin from scales;

4) a third heart chamber to support the lung’s function;

5) it’s sensory perception [i.e. hearing, sight, taste, smell] changing from water based to land/air based;

6) it’s locomotion going from water based [being propelled through the water via the actions of its tail and fins] to land based [being propelled through the actions of its feet and legs]

Again how do all of these happen unguided yet concurrently?

It would seem if a fish population was not getting enough food (i.e. is no longer fit for its environment due to selection pressures) it would die off before it developed all of those things or developed them enough to survive both in the water and land. Not only does it have to survive in it's new environmental niche, but it must survive this transitional phase. 

I can see how an engineer could transform a boat into a car but not an unguided process.

And when one factors in Punc Eck [the fossil record is in stasis 90% of the time] then there is only 10% of the time available then previously thought.

I think that it has been shown that species can adapt to their environment; have certain features change over time. But can this adaptive process account for the origin of features. It is one thing to change a beak; it is quite another to get a beak from non-beak. And to do it unguided; via random mutations and random selection pressures.

--Problem number 3--

And I haven’t even mentioned where or how DNA came into existence. Look at the problem. Life first [Prokaryotes] appear 13.5 billion years ago. Prokaryotes are fairly complex. They have a DNA based protein synthesis apparatus. And DNA is useless unless it is translated, read, and the instructions followed.

I think it was Karl Popper who said that the machinery by which the cell translates the DNA consists of at least 50 macromolecular components which are themselves coded in DNA. So it is a wicked circle

DNA needs to be translated by components which themselves are coded by DNA! 

But this is what one has to believe if they think naturalism and or evolution is true.

However, this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment laboratory experiment indicates that evolution alone can create new complexity in a way that is repeatable and consistent.

465,Deeper Than a Dual Perspective?,1,True,"Black v. White, Democrat v. Republican, Evolutionary Theory v. Creationism

Our eyes are capable of gray area as well though, aren't they?

While I'm certainly not pulling for a marriage of creationism and evolution, or that one is more reasonable than the other. I have noticed aspects of (NOT religious, but) spiritual understandings/behavioral attitudes that don't conflict evolutionary theory.

There are ""hybrid understandings"" of creationism and evolutionary theory as we're probably all more than well aware of.

I think it's becoming easier to forget with such grounded notions of evolutionary theory, that anthropological disciplines of all kinds live and breathe on a holistic perspective, as well as a certain amount of relativistic charity. 

To get dogmatic with evolutionary concepts and understandings, and to ditch the relativistic perspectives, because of what we are already SURE of, is to stoop lower than the Westboro Baptist Church, in my own perspective. 
To consider perspectives, and to try to understand different views is something we should strive for. 

If one cannot even attempt to give of their inquisitive nature in an effort to try to be a part of a solution, there's no reason that particular person shouldn't be considered a part of the problem.

There's loads of different understandings of what God is.. 
I can pick out many qualities I would consider divine within the Human animal.

However, I don't know, for fear that I'll wake up and everything I know will be a lie that I should factor out any understood beliefs (besides that a man literally lived after being swallowed by a whale, of course ;)). The literal interpretations seem to never match up.

I don't think this is a reason to disregard what we understand scientifically, or spiritually; rather I think it's a reason to be more open-minded about our known and unknown universe.

Evolution doesn't have to dismiss the seriously, inquisitive nature of humanity when it comes to what we don't know, and those who study evolution shouldn’t fear, or feel threatened as a result, and should consider perspectives that we aren't sure how to test yet.

I'm personally encountering some spiritual understandings though, some which have aspects that don't conflict any core understandings of evolutionary theory.

And so, isn't this what we exactly do concerning all radiometric dating. Don't we have to assume that present conditions (i.e.: decay rates) have always remained constant and universal? What is our reasoning for this?",1394049087,0,2014-03-05 14:51:27
471,Can you please help me debunk the following creationist website?,5,True,"This http://www.darwinconspiracy.com/ was given to me by a creationist on Facebook as their primary source.

Here is the response that I myself was qualified to write up: 

""I will respond to your website/post point by point: 
1: The Piltdown man was indeed a hoax, however, there was no real ""cover up"". From the start, many scientists were suspicious of it (http://black.clarku.edu/.../map.../piltdownmandible.html), and in the end, it was falsified by evolutionary biologists. At the same time, there is no denying that many were indeed fooled by it, for a while.

2: We now have a much better understanding of human->chimpanzee ""missing links"", see here http://www.sciencemag.org/content/203/4378/321.abstract http://www.amnh.org/.../the-history.../the-first-humans/lucy for Australopithecus afarensis, just one of many fossils that have been confirmed as those of human ancestors. We can trace many transitional forms of human evolution, from Australopithecus to Homo Erectus to Modern Humans.

3: There are plenty of genetic mechanisms that create new genes. The one I am most acquainted with is gene duplication: when a chromosome, or chunks of chromosome get duplicated. For example, http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/triple-x-syndrome in humans. See also this: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11841181. Your article addresses this by claiming that ""Although bacteria can duplicate existing genes by mistake through ""gene duplication,"" this only occurs in single sex bacteria and this is not evidence that apes and humans can create new genes with new functions"". However, both examples I cite above reference gene duplication occurring in sexually reproducing complex organisms.

4: here are two articles that provide structural evidence for chromosome fusion: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/215/4539/1525 and http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html. Basically, human chromosome 2 is genetically very similar to two separate chromosomes found in great apes.""

However, I feel like I haven't given an adequate reply to the section ""APE AND HUMAN CHROMOSOMES ARE NOT 98% IDENTICAL BUT ARE TOO DIFFERENT FOR EVOLUTION TO EXPLAIN"" from the original creationist article. Can anyone help me with this?",1391230209,5,2014-01-31 23:50:09
472,On the quality of apologists for Creationism.,5,True,"If Creationism is true, if ""Creation Science"" is truly science, why are the most active and well known advocates for Creationism people who have no scientific credentials (though some pretend to have doctorates like Hovind), and objectively demonstrate a poor grasp of evolution and science in general (despite decades of preaching against it)?

474,Dealing with a evolution skeptic,5,True,"I have a very religious friend who posts a bunch of stuff on his facebook and it generally leads to other religious people taking up his cause and debating me about science. One of them has gone on and on about how we have no idea how the human body determines it's own shape, or how it passes on that information to the next generation, so of course since we don't know this, evolution is only a 'theory' and shouldn't have that much stock placed in it. I have been stumped trying to find info about this on-line, can anyone help me out? ",1381516237,5,2013-10-11 14:30:37
475,Validation,4,True,"I like the notion of open debate on an issue. 

In that respect I would welcome a discussion to debate evolution in terms of the problems yet unsolved or at least in contention, i.e.; Dawkins versus Gould's debate between how rapidly an organism once separated from the general population/environment might be subject to adaptation?


However, on the matter of creationism versus evolution, this is a terminal discussion, beneath contempt except of modern societies and should be raised as a shining example of exactly how zealotry and failure of critical thinking can actively harm a society.

If we as a culture - and as citizens are doing it right, we make it our business to crush the notion that creationism or intelligent design has value AT ALL. 

1. Creationism/intelligent design is manifestly defunct as a basic idea from a scientific perspective because there is no data, no experiment one can conduct or conditions one can set and certainly nothing that can be proven. 

	This horror is revisited by proponents of intelligent design every time the inevitable ""discovery"" of some ""irreducibly complex"" structure, and then watch over the 18 month period afterwards, as a series of ingenious graduate students hungry for some fresh meat, re-destroy their precious bullshit zombie idea. 

2. It's completely false from a mathematical perspective, anyone - ever - with an even passing understanding of emergent systems study can terminally dismiss the idea that ""something complex"" can't arise from less complex systems. 

	This is demonstrably false, as an idea. Thermodynamics aside, one need only look at the very approachable zero player game [""Game of Life""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) by John Conway, some structures weren't discovered until 30 years after Conway's original idea, including but not limited to [self replicating structures](http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Gemini), and [Turing complete](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94) logical structures - which rather completely destroys intelligent design and irreducible complexity. That it was a failure that [Professor Behe's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe) original basic research to call this counter-indication into evidence might even constitute a circumstance where his lack of candor, and thoroughness, certainly call his credentials into disrepute.

3. Lastly of course, the concept of intelligent design and creationism are inescapably religiously offensive. Who are some hucksters from the ""Discovery Institute"" to define the parameters and works of the lord G*d. Who of a religious bend has the gaul to surmise they understand the intent and works of an omnipotent that could have created the entire universe from a single word. 

	Who then are these false supporters of the faith, perfectly content to defile that awe-inspiring concept held by so many religiously minded people, and reduce it to the notion that in a few weeks or months, someone in a lab somewhere, forcibly positioning their cherished beliefs in opposition to basic science.

We stand at the perverse crossroads where the advocates from the ""Discovery Institute"" and other similarly minded advocacy groups denigrate the very notion of an omnipotent creator, and invariably reduce that awe-inspiring concept, to the indeterminate value and academic qualification of some some observations, of a bioengineering process we do not currently understand reducing principles held by millions to a ""god of the gaps"" in our understanding.

This further denigrates the notion of inquiry in two additional areas. 

1. It provides the sad footnote for maintaining cultural relevance for religion in our society, by forcing the notion of religious doctrine straight into the maw of onrushing scientific research.

	Rather than letting it as it properly should, inform and illuminate the moral principles upon which we act with one another in civic society; which is the highest possible value any religion can hope to provide it's believers. It discounts the prospect that a religious belief system can promote the highest ideals and exalt the traditions that have helped our societies and people maintain hope in the face of all manner of adversity, and especially in those times in life when the tools of science offer no solace to our being.

2. Lastly of course, it denigrates the disabuses us collectively of the notion that scientists should in fact be on the lookout for the unknown. This is perhaps seen best when we consider this argument from another perspective.

	Let us consider the notion of a [Kardashev Type 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) or type 3 civilization that has attained something like mastery over matter and energy conversion and has political or engineering influence over a polity spanning whole regions of the galaxy. 

	Ancient beyond description, it's difficult to surmise even in our wildest fiction what public-works projects or engineering efforts might be undertaken by such a civilization. And once freed of the bonds of mortality - perhaps one day our civilization might similarly reach for the stars, and develop vast engineering projects spanning whole star-systems. Who then are we to suggest that in fact some ancient type 3 civilization did not in fact engineer our entire star-cluster. 

	Nothing in science - at all itself prevents this possibility - even for some future star-faring variant of our civilization. Even today we dream of terraforming Mars, altering the orbits of planets to make them more suitable for life. We have million dollar games predicated on this very idea. 

So what I find completely distressing, is that we have reduced the endeavor of our entire great nation, and hold the promise of mankind hostage, to the measly fractured thinking of some avaricious religious zealots, and I for one find it supremely offensive that in this day.

We still ""debate"" such degeneracy instead of intellectually exterminating these ideas where they stand, leaving their advocates utterly withered and unable to utter a word in the defense of such worthless thinking and hopefully re-evaluating the value of holding such degenerate ideas.",1380993459,2,2013-10-05 13:17:39
476,Let's talk about debate tactics.,5,True,"As creationists don't seem to want to hang around here at the moment, why don't we have a discussion amongst ourselves to keep this sub moving.

We all know creationists have no shortage of dishonest debate tactics. The question is, how do we properly respond to them?

What's a creationist debate tactic you encounter a lot, and what do you think the best way of responding to them is?

If someone has already made a comment about a particular tactic, and you would like to present another way of dealing with it, reply to that comment, instead of the OP. This way, if someone's looking for ways to deal with creationists, they can find all the appropriate responses in one spot.",1380946894,34,2013-10-05 00:21:34
477,It's All About How We Interpret the Evidence.,10,True,"Or so creationists claim. Here is a quote from Bevets, a user who looks like they're going to become a regular on this sub:

>I am suggesting that the debate has little to with [data](http://bevets.com/evobiaspics.htm) and very much to do with [filters](http://bevets.com/ti.htm) . 

For those who didn't follow those links, they can be summarised as follows:

The first link says all evidence must be interpreted, it's conclusions are never clearly labelled. We base these interpretations on our world views, which make us interpret all evidence to support our world views. A creationist will always interpret the evidence to support creation, and an evolutionist will always interpret the evidence to support evolution.

The second link says that you will never reach the right answer if you create rules that automatically exclude the right answer. I think this is obvious, and I don't think anyone disagrees with that.

What's not too surprising, is creationists never actually give a guide on how to interpret data. They never give examples of pieces of evidence, and how they can support either side. No doubt this would be counter-productive to what they hope to achieve from this argument. What they're trying to tell other creationists is that they can draw whatever conclusion they want from data. They're telling people that science is all about personal opinion, and all of those opinions are equally valid.

Think of what science would achieve if it did indeed work this way. How would we ever determine a round Earth from a flat Earth? There are indeed interpretations that support both. A round Earther interprets pictures from space as being real, a flat Earther interprets them as being fake. This should illustrate the absurdity of the interpretation argument.

Instead of interpretations, science uses predictions to determine which conclusion is the most likely. Science hypothesises a conclusion, determines what evidence we would find if that conclusion was correct, and then compares that to the evidence.

Let's use the fossil record as an illustration for this methodology:

Conclusion A: the fossil record was laid down in progression over a long period of time.

Conclusion B: the fossil record was laid down at once because of the great flood.

Conclusion A predicts there would be lots of fossils in the ground.

Conclusion B predicts there would be lots of fossils in the ground.

If we were to stop there, we would think that both conclusions were equally valid. Most creationists will stop there for this reason. However, science continues investigating. If both conclusions fulfil the same prediction, the prediction can be made more specific.

Conclusion A predicts fossils would be ordered chronologically; the older fossils bellow the newer fossils.

Conclusion B predicts fossils would be ordered by a combination of ability to escape floodwaters, altitude at the time of the flood, and weight of the organism, all with a degree of randomness.

Now, we have two totally different predictions, so by comparing the evidence to those predictions we can see which one is the most likely conclusion. This is how science works. You can interpret the evidence however you want, but it won't make your conclusion any more likely.",1380680987,4,2013-10-01 22:29:47
478,How did it all start?,10,True,"I hope it is appropriate to ask proponents of evolution about how it all started. Where does random mutation + natural selection take over from abiogenesis?

479,Why Creationism is the absolute truth,0,True,"* Evolution is a guess put forward by scientists to disprove God
* scientists are anti-god atheists who fabricate evidence that the earth is more than 10000 years old. All their evidence is fake if it contradicts the Bible. 
* evolution if it were true would mean Adam and Eve were chimps, but the Bible says they were the first man and woman 
* this evolution is incompatible with reality and what has been said and done
* God is the source of truth and His Word is infallible and perfect
* Men are fallible and hate the truth because the Bible says so. 
* Evolution is a lie that changes over time as an attempt to vanish Holy God from school education, and because of this, school massacres are on the rise as a warning",1380500479,16,2013-09-29 20:21:19
480,Definitions,6,True,"I'll be adding definition to the following terms. Comment if you have a good definition or think of a term that isn't on the list. 

- Evolution: Evolution is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution
- Micro Evolution: changes that occur below the taxonomic level of ""Species""
- Macro Evolution: changes that occur AT or ABOVE the taxonomic level of ""Species"".
- Theory: a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. [source](http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&page=11) Scientific theories are not guesses, they also aren't a rung below facts in a hierarchy of certainty. No theory will ever become a fact, theories explain facts.
Natural Selection (aka ""survival of the fittest""): 
- Natural selection is the process by which certain members of a species survive and reproduce where others fail to do so. Factors influencing Natural Selection include, but are not limited to, ability to survive predation, ability to obtain food, and ability to survive in a particular climate. Natural Selection results in traits that help a member of a species survive and reproduce getting passed on to the next generation, and traits that are less conducive to this being reduced in frequency.
- Common Ancestry: The idea that the ancestry of all organisms can be traced back to a single progenitor.
- Transitional fossil: A fossil showing traits intermediate between two taxa. 

- Creationism: Creationism is the religious belief that the the Universe,Earth,life, and/or mankind were created in the way described by a particular religion's creation mythology. Among others, there are Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu versions of creationism and varying degrees of literalism/metaphorical interpretation.
- Theistic evolution: Acceptance of evolution plus a belief that a god (or gods) had a hand in starting and/or guiding the process.
- Evolutionary creationism: Acceptance of evolution plus a belief that if correctly interpreted the Evolutionary Creationist's creation mythology of choice actually described the process all along.
- Intelligent Design: 
- Old Earth Creationism
- Young Earth Creationism
- Geocentrism
- Flat Earth Creationism
- ""Kind""/""Baramin"": (according to Creationists) a group of organisms that have all evolved from a common ancestor created during the Creation week described in Genesis. ",1380350608,15,2013-09-28 02:43:28

I'd like to keep this forum as free as possible while still having a focused, civil discussion. I'd like to hear your suggestions about what the rules should be.
Some rules I'd like to set to begin with are the following: 

The rules:

- Be polite. No insults or ad hominems, attack the argument, not the person. 
- Don't downvote and move on. If a person has made a reasonable amount of effort in their post, and they've said something you disagree with, employed dishonesty, or used logical fallacies, you should tell them why. Downvoting tells you nothing about the content of your post, except that an anonymous internet user didn't like it. Save downvotes for trolls or spam.
- No proselytizing. 

Suggestions:

- No Gish-Galloping. Stick to one topic/question per thread.
- Be informed. If you think evolution means a dog giving birth to a cat you know literally nothing about evolution.",1380304914,30,2013-09-27 14:01:54
