Actually, here's the funny thing. *He doesn't actually defend ENCODE on the merits*. He just talks up the prestige and how many smart people are part of the team. 

But okay. Biochemical activity and function are not the same thing. Transposons are transcribed. RNA is trafficked to specific places. Transcription is regulated. 

Activity.

3,"&gt; I thought that was somehow supposed to support creationism, and I was confused as hell. I understand it much better now. 

Let me explain them to you:

(1) ""mostly functionless genome""

A mostly functionless genome is required when you believe in a concept called ""genetic entropy"" which implies that the genetic mutation is so high that basically the DNA slowly degenerates (""entropy""). And when the genome degenerates, evolution is not possible. As you see, this is no argument in favour of creationism and falsifying genetic entropy only disables an argument against evolution and does not falsifies creationism, which is the idea that god created life and biodiversity. But creationists have great trouble telling arguments in favour of creation apart from arguments against evolution. 

Generally creationists think that when evolution is debunked, then the work is done. But it ain't. The *real* work, that is, proving evidence for creation or common design, still has to start at that very moment yet. Someone started a thread in this subreddit some months ago with the question whether any creationist could provide any evidence in favour of creation *without mentioning evolution not any argument against evolution* - but no single argument was provided yet many creationists, as if in a reflex, started to argue against evolution anyway - they just really can't tell the difference.

(2) ""the number of  orphan genes and consistent gene flow"". 

OrFAN (""orphan"" is also used) genes are genes that didn't emerge from gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer. Normally new genes come from DNA duplication: some chunk of DNA with a known functionality, like genes, are randomly copied - whereafter one copy maintains the  original function (so it wont be compromised) while the other one serves as a kind of template to produce another gene with a different function - which speeds up evolution because a functional gene already has some ""genish"" features and the new gene thus doesn't need to be built from scratch. 

OrFAN genes have no known homologs anywhere in other more of less closely related species, so they seem to have merged from scratch on. Evidently you can't get too much OrFANs because that would make evolution a very unlikely process. So here again we have an argument *against evolution*: when there are too many orFANs, this would bring problems to evolution. But if it doesn't, it is not affecting creationism whatsoever. Again not being able to tell the difference between arguments in favour of creationism and arguments against evolution.

(3) ""feature that cannot be explained by the flood"".

This would only falsify the literal reading of the bible as young earth creationism does. But the majority of Christians are no YEC at all. But, sure enough, the whole flood caboodle has been falsified by about the whole of modern geology of the last 250 years. *Disastrously*. So, if this, by own admission of YECs, is a key argument of YEC, it has been falsified indeed.

(4) ""tetrapods filling the ark"".

Idem.

(5) ""mtTMRCA date using observed mutation rates over 6k years"".

There was a guy named Jeanson who argued that the most recent common ancestor of humans (""MRCA"") according to the DNA sequence of the DNA of the mitochondria (""mt""), must have lived less than 6000 years ago. Mitochondria are organelles of most eukaryote cells (eukaryotes are, generally, all living plants and animals and some unicellular organisms as well that have more complex cells than bacteria - humans belong to the eukaryotes). Mitochondria have their own DNA apart from the cells DNA in its nucleus). If you look at the diversity in the DNA among the mitochondria of different organisms, and you know the mutation rate, you can estimate the time since the most recent common ancestor of those different mitochondria. 

Jeanson made a little mistake by taking the mitochondria of somatic cells and not of germs. /u/DarwinZDF42 has a [few things to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/86onbs/new_thread_full_of_juicy_content_on_rcreation/dw7jdv1/) about that.",1,1521937531,2018-03-24 20:25:31

13,"&gt; Known nunfunctional transcription will always exist for genes recently broken by mutation.

Are transposable elements ""genes recently broken by mutation""?

(Nope.)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Yes there would certainly originally be selection for transposons that are the most fit, but nobody thinks most transposons in the genome are still actively transposing themselves, or have been any time in the last millions of years.

Did they all become inactive at the same time? Or have they inserted and lost the ability to transmit at different times? 

(The second.)

&gt;Transpon-like elements in our genomes aren't merely co-opting existing transcription start sites--they are providing them.

If they insert at a place that hurts you and it messes with your transcription, you have lower fitness. If they insert at a place that doesn't hurt you, you're fine. So which insertion sites persist?

Estimating the amount of functional nucleotides across the entire genome (as I've done) isn't going to give us an exact number.  There are far too many unknowns.  But even the largest possible margin of error will be many orders of magnitude smaller than the differences between observed microbial evolution and alleged mammal evolution, so the argument still holds just fine.

2.  To conclude that all organisms evolved from a common ancestor with no intelligence evolved.

What I'm doing is removing the storytelling simplifying the technical language most redditors don't understand to expose your argument as circular.

Moreso, different genes tell conflicting stories.  Genes that don't change fast enough are ""subject to strong purifying selection"" genes that evolve too quickly are just evolving faster, and both types are discarded in order to get dates that fit.  When organism A has a large number of genes from clade C when it's supposed to have evolved from clade B, those genes are also discarded in order to get the divergence times evolutionists want.  E.g. [here](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040352) with the animal phyla:

1.  ""Wolf and colleagues omitted 35% of single genes from their data matrix, because those genes produced phylogenies at odds with conventional wisdom""

Sometimes whole clades are [discarded](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526802/):

1.  “When rogue taxa are identified based on support values that are drawn onto a best-known tree, we observe that pruning these rogues yields trees that are topologically closer to the true tree”

You said we should measure phenotypic traits and I was explaining why that cannot measure the rate at which function evolves in terms of nucleotides.  New and modified genes, new protein folds, new binding sites with new biochemical functions.  So let's go at this again with an example:

1.  Humans have hundreds of loci where variants affect height.  If you take two people of average height and selectively breed them over dozens of generations you can end up with a population that's either very tall or very short.  But once you've removed either all of the ""tall"" or ""short"" alleles, you've hit a limit.  

2.  To go further, you need to wait hundreds of generations for mutations to knock out genes that contribute to height, or genes that (for example) shut off the production of growth hormones.  If you continue selecting for this, you'll again hit a limit once you've knocked out all the genes the population can tolerate, and knocking out more genes would make it go extinct.

3.  If you want to get tall or short people by creating or modifying genes with new functions, you'll have to wait even longer still, since mutations that modify or improve the function of a gene instead of degrade it are rarer still.

#3 must occur for long term evolution to happen.  What you're proposing is that we use #1 and #2 to measure the rate at which #3 happens.  That's erroneous.

&gt; I mean, let's take some of these traits, any of these traits. Pick one. How much ""functional information"" is required for the change?

This would be at least 14 nucleotides in echolocating bats and 14 in echolocating whales, although this is by far not the only changes needed for echolocation.  We could get more precise numbers by using a codon table to count the nucleotides needed for each of those AA changes.

&amp;nbsp;

In the case of citrate, the ""switch was broken"" response is a variant on one of two common arguments that show that the creationist arguments in this discussion are unfalsifiable:

On one hand, you can have a mutation that allows a protein to do an extra thing. It previously reacted to molecule A, now it reacts to molecules A and B. 

""Loss of specificity!"" creationists say. Something is ""lost"" or ""broken"". 

On the other hand, you have a protein that reacted to A and B, but specializes to react to *just* A. 

""Loss of function!"" is the creationist response. Again, something is ""lost"". 

But in both cases you get a new trait (especially when the second is preceded by gene duplication, as is often the case when such changes persist). So again, traits are the thing to focus on. ""Information"" is smoke and mirrors, and I have no time for handwaving. ",1,1521922269,2018-03-24 16:11:09

We're not.

&gt;Most (80% ?) of the genome has function, which would not be the case with an unguided process.

Wrong. I lay out the actual numbers [in some detail here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/84rln5/creationist_claim_mammals_would_have_to_evolve/dvtifao/), and also link to other threads in which this has been discussed. The short short version is that the 80% number is based on conflating selected function (being selected to do something for the cell) with mere biochemical activity, which is much more widespread due to the origins of much of the human genome via mobile genetic elements such as viruses and transposons. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Observation of evolution in unicellular eukaryotes like malaria, indicates that natural selection acting on random mutations cannot produce complex functional systems.

Two things.

First, define ""complex functional systems"". The goal-posts move depending on what specific pathways we've determined. 

Second, this isn't even the argument that the source is using here. The source is Michael Behe in Edge of Evolution, and his argument isn't that evolution *can't* generate this stuff, only that complex things can't appear fast enough via evolutionary processes. Creationists can't even get their own arguments right. But on the topic of Behe's point, [we just discussed this at some length](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/84rln5/creationist_claim_mammals_would_have_to_evolve/), and the problem is that creationists can't quantify the information they say evolutionary processes are too slow to generate. It should be clear why quantification is a requirement for that argument to be sound.

This...

&gt;It is monstrously improbable according to realistic mathematical models and computer simulations.

...is related to genetic entropy, since the ""realistic models"" referred to are actually just one: Mendel's Accountant, written by John Sanford, who also coined the term ""genetic entropy"" (the real term in evolutionary biology is ""error catastrophe""). MA is terribly unrealistic, and Sanford is actually [made up and manipulated data](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPW6H4PXYFMTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0981631606) in his book to get the answers he wanted.

55,"Via u/Nareus:
&gt;I’d say that the mechanisms evolution is supposed to operate on aren’t sufficient to create the variation required to make one animal into another. Natural selection doesn’t create new information, it only selects the best option within the information available. 

That's true: Selection *doesn't* create new information. *Other* evolutionary mechanisms do. 

Generally, we talk about five mechanisms: Selection and drift, which reduce diversity, and mutation, recombination, and gene flow, which increase it. Picking out one of them and saying that it can't do X therefore evolution is false isn't valid. You must consider all of them.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Mutations don’t create information, they almost always destroy it, and when they don’t, it’s almost always either not beneficial, or beneficial with a bad side effect.

There are a bunch of claims here, goalposts moving within a single sentence.

Mutations can create information (though quantifying that information is apparently something creationists aren't prepared to do), though I prefer to evaluate whether new *functions* or *traits* can appear. Which they can and do. Two simple examples: Tethering antagonism in HIV-1 via the VPU protein, and aerobic citrate metabolism in an *E. coli* lineage of the Lenski Long Term Evolution Experiment. New traits via mutation. 

On the next bit, most mutations are neutral rather than harmful, and beneficial mutations are pretty common. [References here.](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB101.html)

90,"&gt; And thus the question remains about WHY Evolution has been so apparently ""unreasonably effective"" in such a so narrow range of environmental situations (viz: just one in the entire observed universe to date).

What a nonsense. OF COURSE life (thus evolution) only emerged in a narrow range of environmental situations because for life you need particular conditions to be met. The universe itself is full of all kinds of conditions, of which most are not favourable for life. 

The point you make are actually the moot ones. It is the same as if wondering why water flows to the deepest point and thus only follows such narrow pathways (=""rivers""). 

And I note that you conveniently evade arguments to start all over your rant in othe rposts. Don't worry, I will repose my point relentlessly at your service. For instance:

It is nonsense to conclude about the rarity of life from the one example we know of, that is on Earth right now, because we have no means to detect life farther away than Mars (the only planet we visited by landing and researching). The only thing we are able to is to detect whether the conditions on other planets, moons or exoplanets might be fit for life, like the planet being rocky, not too far or close to its sun, containing water etc. That's all we can. And, while missing the means and techniques to detect life, no single conclusion in favour or against extraterrestrial life is allowed.

It is as if you are a late 15th century guy saying that ""until now the only sun we know of is our own because we haven't discovered one elsewhere"". In 1610 Galileo pointed his telescope to the Milky Way and discovered it's actually made up of countless stars. Galileo also noticed that despite he used a telescope that enhances distant objects, the stars didn't look bigger - from which he concluded they must be very far away and thus in reality must be much bigger than they appear. Finally, in 1838, German astronomer Friedrich Bessel was able to calculate the distance to some stars applying parallax measurement and found it to be enormous. Others started to calculate the actual brightness of those stars by measuring them and correct them for distance and concluded all those million stars in the Milky Way are actually suns, some of them even bigger than our own.

You are NOT allowed to make ANY conclusions about the factual abundance of life in the universe. We can only make very uncertain guesses about it and when done, the only sensible answer is that the universe must be swarming with life due to the statistical laws of great numbers (how unlikely the outcome of an experiment might be, but if the number of trials is high enough, the outcome will be close to 100%). The number of solar systems with planets already seems to be quite common and this implies the number of planets is infinitesimal large which makes the odds of life elsewhere in the universe almost 100%. That's the only sensible thing we can tell about it. and *what* we reasonably can tell, indicates life must be a normal feature.

And thus the question remains about WHY Evolution has been so apparently ""unreasonably effective"" in such a so narrow range of environmental situations (viz: just one in the entire observed universe to date).

It is thus not at all unreasonable to look at other exceedingly rare factors in our biospheric situation (such as the presence of consciousness embedded in material forms - also something that we have not observed elsewhere) and surely that would indeed suggest at least some productive lines of inquiry into whether the two exceedingly rare factors are indeed a singular side of some entangle deeper truth regarding the Reality of which we all partake.

And thus - despite gathering so much evidence - we do not know if Evolution is indeed universal instead of just being a quirk of some very particular chemistry.

And thus it is likened to medieval Scientists studying innumerable swans - and concluding a universal law that All Swans Are White. And yet it was only with the European discovery of Australia that counter-examples (ie viz the Black Swan) became available to the said stated European medieval scientists - and (in many cases) it was already too late for them.

Or there may be other factors at play that have lifted Evolution from being vanishingly impossible - as it appears elsewhere in the Observable universe - to being highly (even unreasonably) effective here on our own planet of Earth.

One possible such factor is that we are conscious beings - and thus consciousness combined with Evolution is indeed the missing ""X"" factor that explains why Evolution has worked here and not elsewhere.

And yet very little research has been performed into that hypothesis - or indeed in to exploring other possible ""X"" factors.

Because the human mind which produced the maths as well as the mind self, complies to the very same laws of nature.

&gt; Similarly Evolution has proved to be unreasonably effective in creating the vast array of life on this one planet

How so and how established?

&gt; whilst it appears to have been completely ineffective everywhere else we have observed - from the Moon to the distant exoplanets and galaxies.

That's plainly *untrue* because we have no means to detect life farther away than Mars (the only planet we visited by landing and researching). The only thing we are able to is to detect whether the conditions on other planets, moons or exoplanets might be fit for life, like the planet being rocky, not too far or close to its sun, containing water etc. That's all we can. And, while missing the means and techniques to detect life, no single conclusion in favour or against extraterrestrial life is allowed. 

It is as if you are a late 15th century guy saying that ""until now the only sun we know of is our own because we haven't discovered one elsewhere"". In 1610 Galileo pointed his telescope to the Milky Way and discovered it's actually made up of countless stars. Galileo also noticed that despite he used a telescope that enhances distant objects, the stars didn't look bigger - from which he concluded they must be very far away and thus in reality must be much bigger than they appear.  Finally, in 1838, German astronomer Friedrich Bessel was able to calculate the distance to some stars applying parallax measurement and found it to be enormous. Others started to calculate the actual brightness of those stars by measuring them and correct them for distance and concluded all those million stars in the Milky Way are actually suns, some of them even bigger than our own.

The question for this broader thread is does this constitute speciation. The biological species concept doesn't work well for bacteria, but by either the ecological or phylogenetic species concepts, nylon-digesting bacteria are new species, and therefore are an example of bacterial speciation that has occurred in the last century. 

To provide a bit more detail there, the ecological species concept is based on ecological niche. If you do something different in your ecosystem from everything else, you're a distinct species. Nylon metabolism is a novel ecological niche (since nylon didn't exist prior to 1935), so the species that do it are new species according to this way of delineating species.

The phylogenetic species concept is based on lineages. If a group or organisms is a separate lineage from everything else, they're their own species. Nylon-digesting bacteria diverged from ancestral populations, the other descendants of which do not digest nylon, indicating that the two lineages are now separate, meaning the nylon-eaters are new species.

Sal wants to quibble of how and when this trait first appeared. Is it very ancient, or is it very new? Is it due to the mutation of existing enzymes, or via some other process that resulted in a completely new gene?

140,"&gt;But whales did not develop gill breathing, they still breathe like mammals, just heavily adapted, so they can hold their breath longer.

And humans are just heavily adapted eukaryotes.  What is an actual boundary to evolution, because I don't think the one you presented exists.  You've just moved the goalposts to claim it's not *actually* evolution.  

There is no significant demand, and likely not good pathway either, to develop gills again.  

&gt;Also mammals supposedly evolved from fish, but whales were mammals that evolved from fish, which then again became fish again, but without the fish ability of gill breathing, that is kind of weird, what is the benefit of that?

Whales are only fish in the sense that they are related to fish distantly.  All identifications in biology are based on ancestry, and there's probably a term that isn't fish for those groups.  

You're asking *what is the benefit of that* just shows that you probably don't really know the mechanisms that drive evolution.  Evolution does not think ahead, selective processes are completely in the moment.  

It's likely that whale ancestors benefited from food sources that were both aquatic and terrestrial, but had much more competition on land than in water.  Thus, it was beneficial for them to become fully aquatic, which would then likely lead to them having legs of reduced terrestrial function but improved aquatic function, and then eventually any limbs not useful for swimming would be lost outside of insignificant vestigial parts (and whales happen to have the remnants of legs).

",1,1521649454,2018-03-21 12:24:14
157,"Are...are you trying to be funny?

&amp;nbsp;

Let's break this down. 

The *trait* nylon metabolism, in its present form, has two potential explanations.

1. It has appeared by change many times over history, but has only persisted since 1935, once nylon was invented, and therefore present. In this case, random mutation + selection are responsible for extant nylon-digesting bacteria.

2. Extant nylon metabolism is an ancient trait, that appeared randomly and persisted through drift until the appearance of nylon in 1935. In this case, random mutation + drift over hundreds or thousands of years are responsible for extant nylon-digesting bacteria. 

In both cases, peexisting, similar enzymes were modified via mutation.

So either mutation and selection recently, or mutation and drift over longer periods of time, are responsible, via exaptation, for a complex trait that was, at some point (doesn't matter when) novel.

Take your pick.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, the *niche* these bacteria occupy is ""digesting nylon,"" which did not exist until 1935, since that's when nylon was invented. 

&amp;nbsp;

So when I say the *niche* did not exist before 1935, and you answer by babbling about the possibility of the *trait* existing pre-1935, you're either too ignorant to know the difference, or deliberately conflating the two to muddy the waters.

Skin color is another mutation that occurs. People nearer the equator self-selected genetic mutations that provided a darker skin as protection against the sun. Those that got a mutation for lighter skin were relegated to staying out of the sun longer, giving a natural advantage to those that had darker skin and could hunt/gather longer.

Those in higher latitudes had the opposite effect. They had much less sun, and needed a lighter skin tone. They needed to get enough sun to get enough vitamin D, and a darker skin tone would inhibit that. Those that had darker skin tones would lack enough key nutrient and not be as robust as those with lighter skin.

Actually, a paler skin pigmentation is favored for.  In areas around the equator, it protects you from the sun, but away from there it prevents you from getting enough vitamin D.  Thus, genes that provide a mildly paler complexion are more likely to get passed on as long as resources aren't abundant, leading to a transition to lighter colors.  This cannot, of course, occur over the mere 2,000ish years that people have been moved around, and it might even be impossible now thanks to vitamin supplements.

Ok, acknowledged, I was thinking you were talking about the selfish genes as coined by Dawkins, which takes a different direction.

&gt; I agree that genomes do contain some junk. Some of that junk likely consists of ERVs and the broken human olfactory genes I mentioned above. And some ERVs that are junk will still have strong promoters. But most would have entered our genomes tens of millions of years ago (not 1-6ka) and thus if they really are selfish should have their binding degraded to the point of no longer being strong. 

Not only ERVs and vestigial genes (""broken"" is a misnomer) but also most Alus and a lot more.

Moreover, the sequences and expression of most RNA transcripts are not conserved. This is exactly what you expect for spurious transcription of junk DNA.

When you apply normal population genetic simulation models and calculate the number of offspring needed when, say, 75% of the total genome were functional, it will be dozens per couple - of which all but 2 or 3 will die to get rid of the enormous deleterious mutation load. I think you see the problem here. If this in such conditions were not the case in short generation species this would lead to genetic meltdown in about a few hundred years.

222,"&gt;Species is usually defined by what can breed with each other.

No, absolutely not.  Species are defined through a series of heuristics, but the ""Biological Species Concept"" infrequently comes up.

The most common among plants, fungi, and algae is actually the *Phylogenetic Species Concept*, defined through their evolutionary relationships.  There's also the *Genetic Species Concept*, which defines it based on specific DNA sequences; the *Morphological Species Concept* which bases it on morphology.  There are others, but the ability to reproduce with one another only applies to a small number of sexually reproducing organisms.  What makes a species depends on a number of criteria, and even the Biological Species Concept doesn't always delineate unilaterally on whether or not a species *can* interbreed, but often on whether or not they do.

&gt;Horses and Donkeys are different species because they cannot create viable offspring (Mules are sterile).

This is also not always the case.  There are recorded cases of female mules that were able to produce fertile offspring with stallions.  They're different species largely because they're morphologically and genetically distinct populations.  Similar to how one defines different strains of bacteria.  There are things unique to both groups of animals which make them identifiable to one species versus the other.  It just so happens that they're usually incapable of creating fertile offspring, due to the resulting monosomy.  Remove that one non-homologous Chromosome, and they're able to reproduce again.  

But something can be the same species as something else, be sexually reproducing, and still not produce fertile offspring.  If I take a tetraploid watermelon, and breed it with a diploid watermelon, the end result is a smaller watermelon without ova.  But they're both cultivars of *Citrullus lanatus*.

Mutations that destroy a functional sequence are many orders of magnitude more common that mutations that give a new function to a non-functional sequence, as you propose.  I'm not saying the latter never happens, but everything we know about mutations and function tell us the former is far far more likely.

But let's go back to the quotes you're taking issue [with](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2): 

1.   ""[T]he vast majority of the mammalian genome is differentially transcribed in precise cell-specific patterns to produce large numbers of intergenic, interlacing, antisense and intronic non-protein-coding RNAs, which show dynamic regulation in embryonal development, tissue differentiation and disease with even regions superficially described as ""gene deserts"" expressing specific transcripts in particular cells... Assertions that the observed transcription represents random noise (tacitly or explicitly justified by reference to stochastic (""noisy"") firing of known, legitimate promoters in bacteria and yeast), is more opinion than fact and difficult to reconcile with the exquisite precision of differential cell- and tissue-specific transcription in human cells...  [W]here tested, these noncoding RNAs usually show evidence of biological function in different developmental and disease contexts, with, by our estimate, hundreds of validated cases already published and many more en route, which is a big enough subset to draw broader conclusions about the likely functionality of the rest.""

So are these authors merely just assuming that these ""usually functional"" transcripts are functional because of their transcription patterns?  Are they non-functional sequences that cause disease only when mutated?  No, and we know this because these researchers test function by doing knockouts, and bad things happen when they're knocked out.

Let's talk about ""selected function"" in a separate response also:

&gt; The proper standard for evaluating function in this context is ""selected function,"" which means some function that affirmatively contributes to the physiology of the cell. And creationists can't show any selected functions for any of these purported functional regions.

This is a circular argument.  Suppose I write two programs that share 30% of their code.  That means 70% is not conserved between the two programs.  Therefore 70% is junk?  That makes no sense.  To ague that only conserved DNA is functional requires the premise that all genomes originated from a common ancestor with no intelligent design involved.  The conclusion of your argument is also that, thus making your argument circular.

Am I the only one who thinks DNA must be conserved to be functional?  No:

1.  [Here](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2), from a functional genome researcher:  ""differential expression (including extensive alternative splicing) of RNAs is a far more accurate guide to the functional content of the human genome than **logically circular** assessments of sequence conservation, or lack thereof""

2.  [Here](https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article/8/6/407/216134):  ""Since several known functional long ncRNAs, such as Xist and Air, are poorly conserved, it is evident that relative lack of conservation does not necessarily signify lack of function.""

2.  And [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12024229), from an ENCODE critic even:  ""Functional sequences include but are not limited to sequences under purifying selection at the nucleotide level.""

&gt; And creationists can't show any selected functions for any of these purported functional regions.

Because we creationists don't think it's subject to selection.  That's the whole bases behind the genetic entropy argument.  And why people like Larry Moran (correctly) argues that not much more than 1% of the genome can be subject to selection.",1,1521491336,2018-03-19 16:28:56
248,"There's nothing in your comment that I haven't addressed before, even some points already in this thread.

&gt; why else would these activities exist? How about ""because that's what the ancestral sequences did""?

Why would their transcription depend on cell type or developmental stage? The most effective selfish genes would copy themselves in as many cell types and developmental stages as possible. And through selfish gene selection, we should thus see genomes made up of the most opportunistic selfish genes. Not genes whose transcripts are tightly regulated and only rarely used.  Moreso, if this binding originated from ancient, degraded sequences, the DNA-protein binding should be weak.  But it's strong binding, which only happens with specific, non-degraded sequences.

&gt; Transposons are transcribed! RNA is always shuttled to specific areas. Our cells don't just let RNA wander around!

Your words are the opposite of what genome researchers [say](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/):  ""Moreover, in 80% of the cases where we had sufficient resolution to tell, these RNAs are trafficked to specific subcellular locations. So this is not some fuzzy random signal: their expression is extremely precise, both in terms of the cell specificity and in terms of subcellular localization. That seems to me to have none of the characteristics you would expect if these RNAs are just some sort of background noise.""

&gt; One of the hallmarks of DNA that doesn't do anything (called heterochromatin) is that it's always bound to proteins. So protein binding sure isn't a strong indicator of function.

When ENCODE [reported](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11247.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120906) 17% of DNA participates in specific protein binding, they're not talking about heterochromatin because that's not sequence-specific binding.

&gt; what does all this stuff do? We don't know! They can't tell you

You've asked ""what do they all do"" and every time I have answered you, ""we don't know yet.""  I've listed a ton of evidence that's consistent with function and inconsistent with junk, as well as statements saying that differentially transcribed elements usually end up functional when tested.  Your repetition on this point is as if I surveyed 200 people and found that 100 were men and 100 were women, and concluded that 50% of people are men.  But you keep saying I'm wrong unless I survey every single man woman and child in the US.

262,"Let's start with areas where I think we can agree:

&gt; I also have no idea why you introduce ""selfish"" genes here.

When I say selfish genes, I'm talking about the same thing you are when you describe ""ERVs greedily copy themselves so we are actually stuck with 100,000 different sites with ERVs sequences.""  These are genes that are selected for by their ability to copy themselves instead of being selected because they benefit their host organism.  Thus they are selfish.

&gt; I neither implied that most of the genome consists of vestigial genes or ERVs. I just pointed out to the fact that there must be a bunch of ERVs and vestigial genes that still transcribe and you didn't address that.

I agree that genomes do contain some junk.  Some of that junk likely consists of ERVs and the broken human olfactory genes I mentioned above.  And some ERVs that are junk will still have strong promoters.  But most would have entered our genomes tens of millions of years ago (not 1-6ka) and thus if they really are selfish should have their binding degraded to the point of no longer being strong.  

On lungfish, amoebas, onions, and other outliers in terms of genome size, I think there's a couple possibilities:

1.  A jpeg can be 10% the size of a png, which in turn can be 10% the size of a bmp image, and each format has different pros and cons in terms of size vs fidelity vs encoding speed.  In flies, the DSCAM gene is 100 kilobases and encodes thousands of different proteins through alternate splicing.  Suppose you detangled this and expressed each gene as a separate gene without alternate splicing.  The gene would then be about 10 million bases, although each gene could have a sequence taylor-made for its function, instead of reusing common sequences shared among many genes.  Perhaps organisms with very large genomes also use such a size vs space tradeoff.

2.  Alternatively, these large genomes might actually be mostly junk, created through runaway transposon duplication.  We'll have to wait for the lungfish, amoeba, and onion ENCODE projects to find out.

Now for some parts where I think we disagree:

&gt; how on earth would thousands of the very same copies render any functionality? What process does need thousands of DNA copies to be performed.

You can also find thousands of duplicated sequences of bytes, or thousands of duplicated circuits in computer hardware and software.  As for why we see them in human DNA:  The surrounding DNA causes them to be transcribed in different cell types and developmental stages.  Same sequence, different activation triggers.  Some of the differences likely represent variations in their function, while others probably are from mutations degrading them.  

So let's get back to what I'm actually arguing:

1.  At least 85% of DNA is transcribed, and most (not all) of that transcribed DNA consists of functional elements.
2.  At least 20% of nucleotides participate in functions.

In some decades since the 1980s when HIV showed up. But we know its onset must have been somewhere in the 1930s, maybe even older. 

&gt; ENCODE (the largest research project on genome function ever) thinks that is a significant under-estimate

But it has yet demonstrate that all this massive DNA with biochemical activity actually is functional by demonstrating what functionality. And they also seem to think that when DNA transcribes, it must be functional. Which is *demonstratively* wrong.

&gt; that 20% across all mammals gives us about 170 billion nucleotides contributing to function that would need to evolve.

Did you:

- include segment mutations such as gene duplication instead of only point mutations? So how many mutation *events* are you talking about?

- include that when some trait, involving X number of mutations, once established in any ancestor, doesn't need to be overdone in any of its descendants?

- realize that the basic biology of all tetrapods and including bony fish, and even other fish taxa, are the very same? for instance, look at the endless number of organs we share with fish. As a consequence, the DNA of humans only differs, if I recall well, some 25% from lung fish.

Yes we are but it was an thought experiment. Nevertheless, it's still puzzling what on earth the functionality of all those supposedly functional DNA chunks apart from genes represent. 

But above all, you didn't answer the questions Moran posed.

I also have no idea why you introduce ""selfish"" genes here. I do not think it's much relevant. I neither implied that *most* of the genome consists of vestigial genes or ERVs. I just pointed out to the fact that there must be a bunch of ERVs and vestigial genes that still transcribe and you didn't address that.

&gt; If a majority of these differentally transcribed RNAs are nonfunctional, why is it that when we find one, it usually ends up functional?

How is it that when you own a Buick as a car, you spot Buicks everywhere? The statistical reality is that, despite many geneticists engaged in this kind of research, until now we only found a few hundreds of functional transcribed RNAs out of millions. In the mean time we have pretty good ideas *why* transcription can be done by unambiguously non-functional sequences. for that, let's go back to ERVs.

Humans have 31 different ERVs in their genomes. But ERVs greedily copy themselves so we are actually stuck with 100,000 different sites with ERVs sequences, adding up to 200 million base pairs, 8% of the total genome. That means each ERV type must have on average ~3,300 copies. These copies are not identical because as they are prone to mutations. Hence, they are not quite well conserved. Not being conserved means they are not likely functional. But those sequences are not diverged beyond recognition because they are identifiable as ERVs - because ERVs have quite distinct retroviral genes (Env, Gag, Pro, Pol) that are typical of retroviruses.  Also those copies of the same ERV type also differ in the extent of divergence from the original. Which also makes sense because one copy might be made 1000 years ago while another one 6000 years ago which explains those differences in divergence. 

So we know they are of retroviral origin and yet there are thousands of copies of those for each ERV type and the mere fact that they nevertheless differ in nucleotide sequence means that they undergone mutations and this implies they are not conserved. Which makes sense because how on earth would thousands of the very same copies render any functionality? What process does need thousands of DNA copies to be performed.

But retrovirus DNA has strong promoters that bind various transcription factors and the flanking enhancers ensure that the region around these promoters will be in open chromatin regions that have all the characteristics of real promoter sites. A substantial proportion of the defective retroviruses will still produce transcripts because the promoter region may not be mutated even though there may be lethal mutations elsewhere in the sequence. 

Which proves that transcription is not a sufficient criterion for functionality.

To define what, if anything, the billions of non-protein-coding base pairs in the human genome do, and how they affect cellular and system-level processes, remains an important, open and debatable question. Ironically, it is a question that the language of the current debate may detract from.

Then that's a problem, because they are all factors that effect the results of your model. You can't just assume blindly that all those factors are going to be the same across all species, from HIV to humans.

&gt; Your fourth point is that we can't accurately estimate how many mutations would need to occur to get the function that we have,

The point is actually that I suspect there is an inconsistency between how you are defining function in observed mutations, and how you are defining function in existing genomes. In all your examples, you only counted a small number of mutations that directly contributed to obviously positive effects. Whereas in your estimate of 20% functional genomes, you're only basing this on biochemical activity. To be consistent you would have to either include all observed mutations that have biochemical activity, positive or otherwise. Or, you would have to measure only specific nucleotides in existing organisms that cause obvious positive effects. I don't believe such a measurement is possible on a mass scale.

Remember [that](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2) ""The vast majority of the mammalian genome is differentially transcribed in precise cell-specific patterns."" Why would their transcription depend on cell type or developmental stage?  The most effective selfish genes would copy themselves in as many cell types and developmental stages as possible.  And through selfish gene selection, we should thus see genomes made up of the most opportunistic selfish genes.  Not genes whose transcripts are tightly regulated and only rarely used.

2.  If most of the genome is made of degenerate selfish DNA, why is nearly all of the DNA-protein binding strong instead of weak?   Strong binding requires a specific, non-dengenerate (non-mutated) sequence.  If selfish DNA embedded itself 10s of millions of years ago and has since been free of selection, these binding sites should have degenerated to the point of no longer having strong binding.

3.  Yes, only hundreds (to my knowledge) of differentially transcribed noncoding RNAs have been studied so far.  If a majority of these differentally transcribed RNAs are nonfunctional, why is it that when we find one, it usually ends up functional?

309,"&gt; because neither of them can be calculated in any sensible way

It sounds like you're taking what is a lack of precision and conflating it with something being entirely unknowable.  

There's 5000 species of mammals. If each species has on average 500 million members and an average generation time of 5 years, then over 200 million years you get about 10^20 total.  Although 500 million is generously high--take a look at the various mammal population sizes recorded in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mammals_by_population).  Behe and the guy on stack exchange also independantly estimatd 10^20 as a higher upper bound.  Perhaps the real number is 10^18 or 10^22.  

I've put together more [detailed notes](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/observed-evolution/hiv/#Population-Size) estimating the total HIV population size.  Although perhaps it could also be off by one or two orders of magnitude.

We've seen about 5000 mutations fix (summed total) across the various HIV lineages.  I'm being incredibly generous and assuming all of those were mutations giving new function.  They probably weren't.  Likewise I'm assuming that only 20% of mammal nucleotides contribute to function.  ENCODE (the largest research project on genome function ever) thinks that is a significant under-estimate, but again I'm trying to be as generous as possible to your position.  [Extrapolating](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/82e5ww/convince_me_that_observed_rates_of_evolutionary/dvata10/) that 20% across all mammals gives us about 170 billion nucleotides contributing to function that would need to evolve.  Even there, I'm being generous and only counting the differences between orders, families, and genera, assuming no new function must evolve to separate species, which otherwise would put that 170 billion several times higher.

If we take those 5000 nucloetides vs 170 billion nucleotides, that is a difference of 34 million.  Times the 600x more HIV than mammals is a 20 billion-fold difference.  We only get a number as small as 20 billion because I am being as generous as possible to evolution at every single unknown.  So we can quibble about a 1, 2, 3 or even 4 order of magnitude difference in these various estimates, but that's nothing compared to 20 billion.

335,"&gt; And in 2017 Larry Moran lamented that the ENCODE folks were still attached to this same idea: ""The overwhelming impression you get from looking at the presentation is that all the researchers believe all their data is real and reflects biological function in some way or another.""

Well if the ENCODE cannot, maybe YOU will answer the questions Moran raised in that article:

&gt; The main controversy concerning the human genome is how much of it is junk DNA with no function. Since the purpose of ENCODE is to understand genome function, I expected a lively discussion about how to distinguish between functional elements and spurious nonfunctional elements.
&gt; 
&gt; I also expected a debate over the significance of associations between various molecular markers and disease. Are theses associations reproducible and relevant? Do the molecular markers have anything to do with the disease? 

Here you go....

&gt; Why does something have to be highly expressed to be functional?

It is not about high levels of expression, it's about at *which* level of expression, about passing the threshold. I think Moran could agree as such with you on transcripts buffering or only working under some particular conditions etc. But that has to be demonstrated. Until them you have nothing to hold ground. And, moreover, you need this for an enormous amount of transcripts. Until now we know of biochemical activity of a bunch of DNA sequences without even a hunch of their actual functionality.

Let's have ERVs. these are surmounted retroviral infections whereafter the retrotranscribed, viral RNA is left as DNA chunks in the host's genome. When retroviruses are disabled, it always will be one particular nucleotide or maybe some more, that are altered. The rest of the original viral genes still sit there and are working. and working also means transcription. ERVs also tend to randomly copy themselves and to clutter the genome with many copies. So much transcription here by junk. 

The very same with vestigial genes. For instance, in the fossil record we have specimens of Dorudon, ancient, extinct whale. It had clearly and unambiguously tetrapod hind limbs attached to a pelvis but the pelvis was detached from the spine and both hind limbs and pelvis were extremely tiny for an animal meters tall which must have weighted a ton or two. Even today many whales are stuck with even more reduced hind structures: only a strongly reduced pelvis maybe with only the some femur or knee joint (all fused). So we are dealing here with vestiges. 

Now, as there are still vestiges, the genes regulating the outgrowth of such limbs and pelvis are still active. And thus they transcribe. Does this imply functionality? Not at all. We humans have a whole bunch of olfactory genes that are switched off. We know because these have about the same DNA signature as the ones we also find in other mammals but which are still active - that's why most mammals smell better than humans. i have no doubt that many of these olfactory genes still show transcription activity.

&gt; I'll agree with you that individual tests for function are ideal, but at present we've only had the resources to test the function of a very small amount of DNA.

Indeed. But note that you have the daunting task to explain how enormous amounts of DNA show up to have any biochemical activity like transcription. The current count of the number of genes is a bit under 20,000. Even when you would find 100,000 genes more, it still would be 10% of the genome more explained.

336,"The point is that the Great Filter is identifying different steps of abiogenesis and indicates that these might or actually are very unlikely. There are major objections against this kind of reasoning:

1. *how do you know* any of these steps are unlike? For that you need to have the basic ingredient for probability calculation. And we simply do not have the information to do so. So Hanson only *assumes* they must be very unlikely. But one by one the roadblocks on the route to abiogenesis are taken away by [recent research in abiogenesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ssv4s/abiogenesis_hypothesis_and_evidence_of/).

2. when we take step no. 3 ""from reproductive molecules to simple (prokaryotic) single-cell life"" as an example, creationists for instance raised the DNA paradox: DNA is reproduced in living cells only with the aid of proteins but proteins are only produced as templates of DNA. So creationists argued how extremely unlikely or even impossible it would be to overcome this chicken-egg problem. Until in experiments researchers showed that RNA, also a hereditary molecule indeed self-replicate without any proteins around. and RNA and DNA are biochemically two closely related molecules.

3. saying that abiogenesis is extremely unlikely reminds me of Newton who formulated the equations of gravitation, movement and momentum but failed to calculate the the constellations with 3 or more objects properly with that model. So Newton argued that complex constellations like the solar system, are held together by the all powerful arms of god. Until Laplace entered the scene and applied more advanced mathematics and solved that problem.

4. there is even a far more serious problem with the Great Paradox: it indirectly presumes in stealth mode that abiogenesis would be a process governed by random change. It isn't. When you put oxygen and hydrogen together and add a bit of energy, the react and form water. And they *always* will do so under the right conditions. Other example, more within the realm of abiogenesis: when you have a bunch of different RNA strains and add a bit of energy, they start to react, recombine and replicate, former ever more complex strains and one of these strains also becoming dominant within that population. 

5. This experiment which has been performed dozens of times by now, also show elementary properties of evolution: reproduction, recombination of traits and *natural selection* (because the experiment ends up in one strain becoming dominant - Darwin would have been delighted of hearing of such experiments!). Biochemistry *isn't* a random process and *what* if I tell you that life is an inevitable outcome of the laws of nature and biochemistry *once* the preliminary conditions are met. But on an early earth those preliminary conditions *were* met.

337,"&gt;I am always wondering why debates about speciation are so focussed on all kind of intricate features defining species while the fossil record unambiguously in one blow demonstrates that evolution happens. The fossil record is one big piece of evidence of evolution on an epic scale because we simply see current, whole taxa of organisms up to the level of classes and sub-kingdoms, entirely lacking in earlier geological formations while the biodiversity in those earlier formations are completely different of the life forms we see today and are all extinct. We also observe dozens of instances of mass extinction whereafter life always recovers by producing new species that were not there before while we never see the lost ones again. The fossil evidence is one piece of evidence of radically change in biodiversity. And change in biodiversity is another word for evolution.

Yeah. It seems strange to me to focus on instances of speciation in real time, since A) there can be debate about whether speciation has even occurred (especially among prokaryotes and other organisms that only reproduce asexually) and B) creationists can just insist that it doesn't really count because it's only 'microevolution' within a 'kind'.

The fossil record shows clear evidence of massive biological changes through time. It's a lot harder to just hand wave away.

&gt;You do not even need to include the factor time, no, even better, you better explicitly exclude the factor time by saying that you only focus on the simple observation that biodiversity differs between distinct geological layers in a very consistent way worldwide and insist that nothing has been implied about the actual age of those formations - only the biostratification observed, nothing else.

'Ecological zonation' or 'hydrodynamic sorting from the flood' or something.

340,"I could agree that viruses are not alive. They lack major traits like growth and metabolism that define life but they do have genes and proteins to perform some tasks only found in life and they do reproduce - although by parasitism by infecting host cells whose cell mechanisms are hijacked to reproduce the virus. So we have genes, changing environmental conditions causing selective pressure and reproduction. And the genes are altered by mutations and under selective pressure. All ingredients that in living organisms are essential for evolution are present.

If viruses are not alive they certainly show the powers of evolution to produce entirely new species.

I am always wondering why debates about speciation are so focussed on all kind of intricate features defining species while the fossil record unambiguously in one blow demonstrates that evolution happens. The fossil record is one big piece of evidence of evolution on an epic scale because we simply see current, whole taxa of organisms up to the level of classes and sub-kingdoms, entirely lacking in earlier geological formations while the biodiversity in those earlier formations are completely different of the life forms we see today and are all extinct. We also observe dozens of instances of mass extinction whereafter life always recovers by producing new species that were not there before while we never see the lost ones again. The fossil evidence is one piece of evidence of radically change in biodiversity. And change in biodiversity is another word for evolution.

You do not even need to include the factor time, no, even better, you better explicitly exclude the factor time by saying that you only focus on the simple observation that biodiversity differs between distinct geological layers in a very consistent way worldwide and insist that nothing has been implied about the actual age of those formations - only the biostratification observed, nothing else.

So why engaging in telling apart species which needs considerable knowledge about very technical stuff and, thus, which leaves light years of room to goal post shift or misinterpret?",4,1521286928,2018-03-17 07:42:08

354,"&gt; Most of your points are what we need for modelling evolution theoretically.

More accurately, that's what we need to model evolution in the way that you are trying to do. Most scientists are happy proving evolution without the need for impossible, all inclusive mathematical formulas.

&gt; Yes it's not the same, but this comparison is overly generous to evolutionary theory.

Not really. It's generous in exactly one aspect: The rate of mutation. It's not generous, at least not in any measurable way, in the rate of positive mutations, or rate of fixation of mutations.

&gt; ""all lines of evidence point to the fact that the efficiency of selection is greatly reduced in eukaryotes to a degree that depends on organism size.""

I skimmed through that paper, and it doesn't look like it's referring to efficiency in the same way you are. You are referring to efficiency as ""the ability for a mutation to become selected and fixed"". Whereas that paper seems to be referring to the rates of basic genetic diversity, and little on the ability for that diversity to be selected.

&gt; Even Dawkins agrees that genomes have information.

Any scientist will agree that genomes have information. But the problem is that's not the sort of information creationists are referring to. Creationists are referring to a hypothesis that there's something about genomes that can't form naturally, but they can't measure or define exactly what that is, they just assert blindly that it's there.

&gt; But I'm interested only in nucleotides that are contributing to function, since that's the part that's difficult to evolve (as opposed to random, nonfunctional sequences) I shared criteria for measuring that in another reply in this this thread.

I could possibly accept that definition. But I also suspect that there is an inconsistency in how you are measuring function. When measuring the number of functional nucleotides in existing organisms, your criteria is that it has any sort of biochemical function. Whereas when measuring functional nucleotides as the result of observed mutation, you are only counting mutations with definite positive effects. Is that accurate? By contrast, you cannot measure the number of nucleotides in existing genomes that have definite positive effects.",1,1521254872,2018-03-16 22:47:52

357,"&gt; I think there's hardly any geneticist currently thinking that 85% of DNA is functional, including the ENCODE team. 

ENCODE lead researcher Ewan Birney [said](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/09/05/encode-the-rough-guide-to-the-human-genome/) at the time of ENCODE 2012, ""It’s likely that 80 percent [estimate of functional human DNA] will go to 100 percent. We don’t really have any large chunks of redundant DNA. This metaphor of junk isn’t that useful."" 

And a year ago Larry Moran [lamented](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2017/02/encode-workshop-discusses-function-in.html) that the ENCODE folks were still attached to this same idea:  ""The overwhelming impression you get from looking at the presentation is that all the researchers believe all their data is real and reflects biological function in some way or another.""

&gt; Your article talks about 85% of the genome being transcribed, leading to lncRNA

Well most of it is other types of RNA than lncRNA, but on your three points:

1.  Why does something have to be highly expressed to be functional.  Many transcripts are used in only one cell type or at one stage of development.  Many others only kick in after other genes are knocked out.  For example, the ENCODE team [reported](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6131.long) ""Loss-of-function tests can also be buffered by functional redundancy, such that double or triple disruptions are required for a phenotypic consequence.""  It could also be the case that some transcripts are only used in response to this or that disease.

2.  Conservation presumes common descent, and is thus a circular argument when used to defend evolutionary theory.  Suppose I made two computer programs, and those two programs only shared 30% of their code with one another.  Would it follow that the other 70% (which is not conserved) is nonfunctional?

3.  I'll agree with you that individual tests for function are ideal, but at present we've only had the resources to test the function of a very small amount of DNA.  But as I noted above, ""In fact almost every time you functionally test a non-coding RNA that looks interesting because it's differentially expressed in one system or another, you get functionally indicative data coming out.""  And we have ""hundreds of validated cases already published and many more en route, which is a big enough subset to draw broader conclusions about the likely functionality of the rest.""  If I survey hundreds of Americans and find that 50% are male and 50% female, would it be rational to expect only 10% of people across the US are female?  Why then expect that most differentially transcribed DNA is junk?

&gt; This is a serious issue. The climate has been changing since the beginning of time how can we stop it now?

That is true. Climate change has killed millions before and will do so in the future. You might ask yourself what makes this one so special? I'd have a few points off the top of my head:

1. If the current global warming is *anthropomorphic* (human made) then we're literally running into a *preventable* extinction event. If it's preventable, why do it?

2. If we are truly going trough an extinction event (which we already are, animals are going extinct in record rates) that this will be the first time in earth's history where greenhouse gas accumulation was the cause of it.

3. There has never been such a rapid accumulation of gases on earth. It's literally the fastest ever. Faster than any of the other ""gas events"" we had on earth, like the great oxygenation which likely killed off 99% of single celled organisms on earth once.

&gt; Once we stop the climate from changing

Don't understand the question. Climate will always change. if we're going to run into an extinction event, I want it to at least be one that we aren't responsible for.

What we should do right now is **stop** doing the things that is most likely *causing* the current rapid climate change. What we do later is simply... later.

And also within a number of threads. 

The short version is this:

We've characterized about 85% of the human genome. About 2% is genes, 1% is regulatory, and 7% is ""structural,"" like centromeres, telomeres, or spacers where the size matters but sequence doesn't. That's about 10% that has a documented function. 

15% isn't well characterized.

Of the remaining 75%, about 45% is transposable elements of some kind (SINES, LINES, retrotransposons), about 9% is virus-derived (about 8% ERVs, and 1% DNA-virus-derived), about 1% psuedogenes, and about 20% introns. This is all well-characterized, and it's *not* functional. 

However, JohnBerea and others would have you believe that most of that stuff *is* functional based on it's biochemical *activity*. For example, many transposons and transposon-derived sequences are transcribed, and the transcription is often tissue-specific, and the resulting RNAs are trafficked to specific places within cells. And protein binding is widespread throughout the genome, not just in genes and known functional regions. 

This is taken as for-sure evidence that the majority of these well-characterized, because why else would these activities exist? How about ""because that's what the ancestral sequences did""? Transposons are transcribed! RNA is *always* shuttled to specific areas. Our cells don't just let RNA wander around! 

And protein binding? One of the hallmarks of DNA that doesn't do anything (called *heterochromatin*) is that it's *always* bound to proteins. So protein binding sure isn't a strong indicator of function. 

And on top of all of that, what does all this stuff do? We don't know! They can't tell you. They can say ""Well, it's associated with X"" or ""it's related to Y,"" where X and Y are some disorders, but *that doesn't tell us anything*, because a non-functional sequence that does something new often causes disease. This is called a gain-of-function mutation, and is a common disease pathway. The *point* is that the sequences are non-functional prior to the mutation occurring. 

The proper standard for evaluating function in this context is ""selected function,"" which means some function that affirmatively contributes to the physiology of the cell. And creationists can't show *any* selected functions for any of these purported functional regions. 

And no matter how many times I explain all of this, JohnBerea and others just repeat the same set of stats about transcription, RNA trafficking, and protein binding. Every damn time. ",1,1521238113,2018-03-16 18:08:33

380,"&gt; At least 85% of DNA is copied (transcribed) into RNA.

I think there's hardly any geneticist currently thinking that 85% of DNA is functional, *including* the ENCODE team. Your article talks about 85% of the genome being transcribed, leading to lncRNA (long intergenic non-coding RNA). But in order to be really functional, there are at least three requirements to be met: (1) expression levels that are very high, i.e., imposing significant cost on the organism, (2) a high degree of conservation (if not it apparently does not play a notable biological role that needed to be conserved), and/or (3) experimental evidence that the ncRNA is required for some important biological process. 

Without this evidence, transcription does not suffice as criterion for functionality. So, how far we now at meeting those above mentioned requirements? Well:

&gt; Thus far, only a small minority of lncRNAs have been shown to be important for organismal development, cell physiology, and/or homeostasis. As of December 2014, the LncRNA Database2, a repository of lncRNAs “curated from evidence supported by the literature,” lists only 166 biologically validated lncRNAs in humans.

So you have no proof of 85% of the genome being functional. You only know that parts are transcribed. But transcription alone is not sufficient for functionality. Not any biochemical signal suffices for functionality and that was the main lesson learned from (and *by*) ENCODE. Apparently you missed that.

Those authors also note that ""with a greater number of protein–protein interactions involved with macromolecular complexes, there are increasing negative fitness consequences of single gene duplication,"" and we see a greater number of protein-protein interactions in complex animals.

Yes! Exactly! Now what you're missing is this:

That's also true. So where did they come from? Gene and genome duplication followed by exaptation, with a large portion of duplicated sequences degrading to non-functionality. This is why your fixation on point mutations is so myopic. While that's the main mechanism to generate novelty in small viral genomes, it *isn't* in multicellular eukaryotes. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The rest

Let me ask again, very clearly: What do all of those 600 million functional nucleotides *do*? We know about 2% are in genes (though it's questionable whether wobble sites count as ""functional"" in your definition), and let's be generous and say 1% are regulatory. Call another 6-8% structural as spaces, telomeres, and centromeres. *What does the rest do*? Keep in mind, that stuff that you claim is function, that approximately 10% that I dispute, it isn't within the less-well-characterized 15% or so that may or may not be functional. It's stuff that we've characterized very well, that we know where it came from and what it does, but you claim is functional based on biochemical activity.

I don't question evolution's ability here, so that's not relevant.  But those alleles had to come from somewhere.

Human genome, based on what I cited [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/84rln5/creationist_claim_mammals_would_have_to_evolve/dvsq9ej/) in this thread, at least 600 nucleotides are functional, from the 20% times 3 billion nucleotides.

Kangaroo genome is around 3 billion nucleotides is also a mammal so it's probably also at least 600m, but there hasn't been a Kangaroo ENCODE project yet so we can't say with as much certainty.  Komodo dragon--I have no clue.  Amoeba genome [as I replied to you already](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/84rln5/creationist_claim_mammals_would_have_to_evolve/dvsq9ej/)  is probably most junk from runaway transposon duplication because amoebas are simple and their genomes are huge.

You're going to reply ""But that's not precise enough!""  And sure, it's only our best estimate from the data we have.  But where are you planning to go from there?  Any argument you have isn't going to come close to bridging the 8 orders of magnitude difference between rates we see evolution producing function in microbes vs what it would have had to do in mammals.

",1,1521216774,2018-03-16 12:12:54
412,"If you are right (which I beleive you are), your argument will get stronger as we have more data an mammalian function. I'll point out something DarwinZDF42 doesn't account for, for example, the phosphoproteome.  He's specializes in viruses, not eukaryotic genomes.

Each gene that humans might have homology with a typical bacterium likely has Post Translantional Modifications (glycolisation, phosphorylation, etc.) that turbocharge eukaryotic function and makes them difference fairly significant with added function, making the individual amino acid residues important.  Plus in eukaryotes, the DNA is used in a 3D regulatory function, celled the 4D nucleome.  Oh, that's the other thing, prokaryotes don't deal with nucleome.

Take for example Topoisomerase in prokaryotes, vs.  humans.  Human topoisomerases have a lot of phosphorylation modifications that are made real time.  Same for all of their proteins.   Eukaryotic proteins are like miniature RAM modules.  Read (binding proteins), write (kinases), erase (phosphatase) mechanisms have to be in place to make use of the RAM on the topoisomerase (and all other proteins with phosphorylations).  Lenski's examples is pathetic.  

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/367/1602/2540.full.pdf

For example, they had two groups of mice. One group was forced to study how to solve a maze, then the other did nothting.  They then killed the mice 6 hours later and examined their brains.  The brains of the mice that studied had twice as much phosphorylation on their proteins!  Ergo, the RAM on these proteins is significant.  Nothing like this happens in the prokaryotic world since prokaryotes don't implement nervous systems.  So even aside from Orphan genes, even just tallying the differences in homologous genes between humans and bacteria, there is a lot of functional difference.  So, going from a brainless creature (like prokaryotic bacteria, or eukaryotic yeast) to a thinking one (like a mouse or human) one has to reformat a large fraction of homologous genes.  And we're not even talking glycolisation (which is another layer of RAM on 50% of the proteins in humans).

423,"You haven't posted anything here that I haven't responded to you before.  I've used this argument for years because it's a solid argument.  I'll give you the same points I've given you previously:

**First:  Functional  DNA**

Let's review the evidence and then I'll respond to your two objections here:

1. [At least 85%](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003569) of DNA is copied (transcribed) into RNA.

2. When and where DNA is copied to RNA occurs in specific patterns that depend on the cell type and the stage of development.  See [here](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/) or [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003569)

3.  Among DNA copied to RNA transcripts in the human brain, [at least 80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/) are taken to specific locations within their cells.

4.  At least 20% of DNA consists of either specific sequences where proteins bind to it, or instructions for making proteins (exons), and much known function that exists outside of protein binding spots and exons.  From [ENCODE](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11247.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120906):  ""[E]ven with our most conservative estimate of functional elements (8.5% of putative DNA/protein binding regions) and assuming that we have already sampled half of the elements from our transcription factor and cell-type diversity, one would estimate that at a minimum 20% (17% from protein binding and 2.9% protein coding gene exons) of the genome participates in these specific functions, with the likely figure significantly higher.""

5.  About 95% of mutations that cause noticeable effects are outside of the 1-3% of DNA that creates proteins, also suggesting that most function lies within noncoding DNA.  See figure S1 [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771521/bin/NIHMS492174-supplement-SOM.pdf) or table 1 [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325768/).

Points 1-3 give us a lower-bound estimate of how much DNA is within functional elements.  The number is likely higher because not all cell types and developmental stages have been surveyed yet, and DNA doesn't have to be transcribed to to be functional.  But that's not to say that each nucleotide within these elements is sensitive to substitution.  Points 4-5 give us lower-bound estimates of how much DNA is sensitive to substitution.  Hence why I think 20% is a generous lower bound.

You object that tissue and cell type specific regulation doesn't equal function, but that's the opposite of what genome function researchers [say](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2):

1. ""Assertions that the observed transcription represents random noise (tacitly or explicitly justified by reference to stochastic ('noisy') firing of known, legitimate promoters in bacteria and yeast), is more opinion than fact and difficult to reconcile with the exquisite precision of differential cell- and tissue-specific transcription in human cells.""

Moreso a [study in 2017](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.041009) looked at places in DNA where proteins latch on, across 75 organisms including humans, mice, fruit flies, and yeast:  ""Using in vitro measurements of binding affinities for a large collection of DNA binding proteins, in multiple species, we detect a significant global avoidance of weak binding sites in genomes.""  This is significant because:  ""Most DNA binding proteins recognize degenerate patterns; i.e., they can bind strongly to tens or hundreds of different possible words and weakly to thousands or more.""  An avoidance of weak binding rules out that this DNA is being transcribed accidentally.

It's true that most DNA has not yet been tested for function, but among differential expressed DNA (the good majority), enough has been tested for function that we can extrapolate that most of the rest is functional:

1.  [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/):  ""In fact almost every time you functionally test a non-coding RNA that looks interesting because it's differentially expressed in one system or another, you get functionally indicative data coming out.""

2.  And [here](https://thehugojournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1877-6566-7-2):  ""Where tested, these noncoding RNAs usually show evidence of biological function in different developmental and disease contexts, with, by our estimate, hundreds of validated cases already published and many more en route, which is a big enough subset to draw broader conclusions about the likely functionality of the rest.""

In the past you have protested, that ""they didn't test all the DNA yet!""  But this is the same principle to draw conclusions from any survey or clinical trial.  Questioning this is special pleading.

Large c-values like we see in onions and the amoeba you mentioned likely are mostly junk DNA.  Perhaps a product of runaway transposon duplication in those genomes.  But that doesn't have any bearing on mammalian functional DNA.

**Second and Third:  Mammal adaptive radiations / evolutionary rates**

Adaptive radiations take place largely through founder effects and shuffling and loss of alleles, not the generation of new function. To say that this causes beneficial mutations to arise and fix a 100 million times faster makes no sense.  Especially [when](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944742/?report=classic) ""prokaryotes appear to be much more efficient than eukaryotes at promoting simple to moderately complex molecular adaptations"" [and]http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/450.full() ""all lines of evidence point to the fact that the efficiency of selection is greatly reduced in eukaryotes to a degree that depends on organism size.""

If evolution were capable of finding and fixing new functions at the rate you propose, you should be able to find a microbial species we've studied somewhere that can bridge this 8 orders of magnitude gap between the rates at which we see evolution producing function at present, vs what it's alleged to have done in the past.

**Other Objections**

Sexual recombination just changes the frequencies of existing alleles.  This can lead to new phenotypes, but it doesn't increase the amount of information in genomes so it's irrelevant to bench-marking the rate at which evolution produces new information.

Gene duplication is indeed very common, but that just leads to the same information twice.  Only if a duplication is followed by mutations that replace or enhance the function of a duplicated copy, then does it generate new information.",1,1521211235,2018-03-16 10:40:35

&gt; Without a mathematical model how do you go about proving that natural selection acting on random mutations actually work the way you believe it does? 

So no ""why"" here but ""how"".

It is plain and simple: in science we do not ""prove"" but we provide *observational evidence*. And when you want to know if natural selection acting upon random mutations actually occur, you start to *observe*. You set up experiments or, just as Darwin did, make field observations.

Example: Newton's famous model of gravitation, momentum and movement of course is mathematical. He established that when bodies have more mass they exercise more gravitational force but this force will decrease when the bodies are more distant from each other. That was his *insight*. *Then* he cast this idea into a mathematical model. Did he prove anything by *that*? No. Even in 2018 we do not understand what gravity actually is. We only can quantify its effects. Newton's particular mathematical model wasn't even correct. Astronomers could not predict the orbit of Mercury correctly with it. We now know that Newton's model only applies when the gravitational fields are not strong (like the enormous sun mass and Mercury close by).

When you set up a nice mathematical model, then the real deal starts: gathering observational  evidence it actually is a correct model. So when astronomers calculated the point where to expect Mercury a month later in its orbit and pointed their telescopes there (*observation*), it was not there. Sorry Newton, wrong model. Fortunately we have a new model, Einstein's which accounts better for gravitation, movement and momentum, also in strong gravitational fields. Was Einstein's model correct?

3. to calculate the upper bound of the number of mammal's, Let assume the entire land area of the earth was completely covered with mice

And I shall leave it by that because it is complete caboodle and don't want to spend much time on it.

Of more concern is why John even needed to estimate this number, what's its purpose. I think that he wanted to state that despite such large numbers of mammals *and* taken the evolutionary innovation rate among *microbes*, there isn't enough time for evolution to create the current biodiversity (which needs such innovations).

But the rate of evolutionary innovation does not merely depend on the number of individuals *lived* but on the number of *conceptions*, the number of fertilized eggs because one important mechanism for evolutionary innovation is the genetic variation brought in by genetic mutations. Not all such variation is passed to the eventual newborns nor to the eventual adults that reached their own reproductive age but taking the number of individuals ever *lived* is just not correct (the whole calculation model of john is wrong once stuck with that model this would be even wrong).

Ad /u/DarwinDZF42 already mentioned, no segment mutations are considered nor count in (DNA/gene duplications, etc.). But differently from him, I won't consider this only a minor concern in this context.

451,"Because I'm in a bit of a rush today, I'm just going to repost another comment I made on this topic, that is quite relevant:

I'm always highly skeptical of any attempt to disprove, or for that matter prove, evolution through mathematical arguments alone.

The fact is evolution is a hugely complicated process, involving countless genomes, populations, and organisms, all coming together to form the patterns that we simplify into mutation + selection = the life we see today. It's something that simply can't be distilled into a simple mathematical formula.

Now if you just wanted to know the basics of X mutations in Y time = Z divergence, then that's pretty simple. But the problem is there are a lot of other factors that need to be considered. And in reality, most of those factors are not understood to the point where we can punch them into some all inclusive formula.

For example, these points are all quite contentious, subjective, unknown, and/or imprecise:

* How long it takes for a mutation to become fixed. This would differ based on population sizes, breeding rates, and selective pressure. Not to mention there isn't a clear divide between ""fixed"" and ""not fixed"".

* How many mutations can be fixed at a time. In a population a number of mutations would be occurring. In sexually reproducing organisms a number of them would be spreading throughout the population at once.

* The precise number of positive, neutral, and negative mutations that occur in organisms. A lot of the creationist arguments make the assumption that very few positive mutations occur. Some even go as far as to say that every non-positive mutation must be negative. This is usually based on the small number of mutations that have obvious effects, like being able to digest nylon, rather than an honest consideration of mutations having minor, much less obvious positive effects.

* The precise number of positive, neutral, and negative mutations that need to occur in organisms. For example, we know that humans and chimps differ by about 35 million base pairs. But we can't say which of these were positive, negative, or neutral. Furthermore, it's highly subjective exactly how many of the changes between us could be considered positive, negative, or neutral.

* The rates of evolutionary change between larger, slower breeding organisms. Applying the rates of HIV evolution to mammals is obviously wrong to begin with.

* Creationist nonsense, where they talk about genetic information, function, specified complexity ect. as some kind of measurable trait in the genome, when they have no way of measuring it.

1.  Take a look at [this figure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945182/figure/F2/)  There's about 3-5% DNA conserved between humans and more distantly related mammals.

2.

I've put together my notes in [this article](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna/) that goes through other estimates of how much DNA is sequence specific, and most are greater than 20%.

3. Why is it not reasonable to assume that the diversification of ancestral mammal into bats, cetaceans, or various marsiupials would require less functional evolution than it would to get to humans?

473,"&gt; Where are the prototype/primitive transitions that show how the tympanic membrane, stapes, etc. came to be? Why do such traits appear fully formed and abrupt? 

They didn't and you are not designated to judge because you simply do not count in the actual fossil observations. You just leave out major chunks of the fossil evidence. That is DECEIT.

",1,1521140560,2018-03-15 15:02:40
474,"Ok, so let's have the fossil evidence:

1. we have early synapsids, mammals and mammaliaformes still with articular and quadrate jaw bones. 

2. we have reptiles extant and extinct with articular and quadrate jaw bones and not the three ossicles of mammals.

3. in all basal members of the 3 major clades of amniotes (synapsids, eureptiles, and parareptiles) the stapes are quite massive props that support the braincase, preventing them from being part of the hearing system. But in later groups the stapes slowly transform into functional part of the hearing system. But the therapsid lineage of the synapsids (including mammals' ancestors) the stapes bones were still in contact with the quadrates but functioned as auditory ossicles rather than braincase supports and may have had a dual function. During the Triassic we observe mammal fossils having the quadrate (which is directly connected to the stapes), the articular (connected to the quadrate) and the angular (connected to the articular), once parts of the jaw bones, becoming free-floating bones.

4. this transformation was enabled by a steady increase in the size of the dentary, starting with the therapsids, and we observe this ending up in the dentary eventually making contact with the squamosal, a bone in the upper jaw located anterior to the quadrate, allowing two simultaneous jaw joints. This we might call the ""mammalian jaw joints"". As a consequence we see transitional fossils (cynodonts and early mammaliaformes) having *two* set of joints, the old ""reptilian"" and the new ""mammalian"" ones.

5. this about the stapes in more detail. Moreover, we observe extant reptiles and early synapsids, mammals and mammaliaformes still with articular and quadrate jaw bones. But in mammals these are lacking. The question is: where did these go? You *must* answer those questions. Two possibilities: these bones were lost or they were co-opted. Seems to be co-opting because we do see three bones in mammalian ears that are lacking in synapsids, mammaliaformes and modern reptiles. There we have them, especially when we see the gradual loss of function of these bones due to the outgrowth of the dentary in therapsids leading to extra joints of these with the squamosal in species with two sets of jaw joints, eventually in those the loss of the ""reptilian joints"", the three obsolete jaw bones becoming free drifting bones, gradually becoming tinier and tinier and ending up in the middle ear.

So you can only *argue* that the sequences are mere assumptions when you ""conveniently"" leave away massive amounts of observational evidence and only focus on the data that fit your creationist pre-assumptions. That is unscientific as can be.

Your *assumption* can be discarded without any ado only because of these omissions, unless you can count them in and still think they miss something. Let's hear of them then but at this point we just shrug and lean back awaiting your better account of the observational evidence.

476,"&gt; That may be true, but that isn't always the case. 

But it *is* the case in the malleus and incus, the fossil evidence clearly leads to the conclusion these have homologs in reptilian jaw bones. Because in the fossil evidence you can follow the subsequent steps, ending up mammals with extra ossicles reptilians don't have but lacking the jaw bones reprilians actually still have. But you are correct concerning the eardrums. But it seems to me these are explainable as examples of exaptation.

Ah.  Well you will have to excuse me, it wasn't clear.

As for experiments about the past.... we don't have a time machine.  How do you suggest we do experiments about the past?  If experiments about the past are absolutely necessary... then ID has no basis either, nor any religion.  You should think a bit about what you claim is valid evidence.

If you truly believe your own argument, is it safe to assume you are agnostic about evolution, ID, and all religions other than one formed recently?

Failure to do so would be dishonest.

It wasn't meant to show that e.coli. become birds.  It was in direct response to your claim that no experimentation takes place.

Could you provide an example of an evolutionary biologist that makes such a claim?  You must be able to, since you clearly said some do.  I would love to see those claims, I will be the first to contact them an let them know they are idiots who do not understand evolution in the least.

 - Do you have any factual observations to the contrary where its been witnessed a creature gave rise to an elephant

Well, elephants give rise to elephants. And that would be an example of a creature giving rise to an elephant.

No, it doesn't.  They do however have a common ancestor.

0,"&gt; First, we must apply this outcome of actual research to the work of Mary Schweitzer et al., who found not only mere organic material in the marrow of a tyrannosaurus rex femur, but snippets of DNA! 

Mary Schweitzer didn't find snippets of DNA. What she indeed found was remnants of original dinosaur proteins that with considerable effort (that is several subsequent chemical treatments) could be extracted from fossilized structures.

&gt; that means that Schweitzer's marrow cannot be 70 million years old, as it must be to comport with the evolutionary hypothesis.

Yet it is, 66 million years to be precise. How do we know? Because the femur Schweitzer used was from the Hell Creek formation. The geological layers those specimens were found was dated applying *different* radiometric dating techniques simultaneously. They all yielded an concordant age of ~68 million years. When you apply *different* radiometric dating techniques, all based on different principles, the sheer odds they will yield the same result *by random chance* is virtually nil, *especially* when one of more of them, according to creationists, are flawed. This is called the principle of calibration. Here are the results:

Name of the material | Radiometric method applied | Number of analyses | Result in millions of years
-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------
Sanidine | 40Ar/39Ar total fusion | 17 | 64.8±0.2
Biotite, Sanidine | K-Ar | 12 | 64.6±1.0
Biotite, Sanidine | Rb-Sr isochron | 1 | 63.7±0.6
Zircon | U-Pb concordia | 1 | 63.9±0.8

&gt;*Source: G. Brent Dalrymple ,“Radiometric Dating Does Work!” ,RNCSE 20 (3): 14-19, 2000.

You ""forgot"" to mention that Schweitzer also undertook considerable effort to find out how original protein snippets could survive such a long time span. [Here](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1775/20132741) are the results. 

Which brings us to the next topic: the validity of the creationist's notion of a 6,000 years old cosmos. We could consider this a geological hypothesis. Normally it takes one single, well aimed experiment or observation to falsify a scientific hypothesis. Mostly such falsifications will raise a lot of discussion and the result may need to be replicated by other researchers to be sure but generally that's it.

Now, the 'hypothesis' of a 6,000 years old earth has been falsified *more than 100 times* by all types of dating techniques, all based on very different principles and thus methodologically spoken entirely independent of each other. *Each single* of these dating techniques has yielded instances where objects, materials or specimens were dated to be older than 6,000 years. To get an impression: read [this](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/category/from-stars-to-stalagmites/age-of-earth/), [this](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/100-reasons-the-earth-is-old-reblogged-from-age-of-rocks/) and [this](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation) (there's overlap but together they add up well over 100).

The 'hypothesis' of a 6,000 years old earth has been utterly and *disastrously* falsified by a tremendous amount and wide variety of observations. It is completely pulverized.

Maybe it's interesting to know that Mary Schweitzer started as a YEC. Now she gets annoyed by the endless obfuscation by YEC's.

Yes, there is no universally-applicable, one-size-fits-all One True Species Definition. And for any species definition that anyone has yet come up with, there *are* critters to which that species definition just doesn't apply.

Why should this be so? *Why* is it difficult to define species?

Under an evolutionary paradigm, in which new species arise as a result of accumulated changes in their genealogical lineage, it makes perfect sense that there would be critters that have *both* distinctive features of the ancestral species *and* distinctive features of the descendant species. And these critters would be *genuinely difficult* to classify. So under an evolutionary paradigm, it *makes sense* that species would be hard to define.

Under a Creationist paradigm, every critter fits into a specific pigeonhole, said pigeonhole being its ""kind"", and *no two ""kinds"" are in any way related*. **All** ""kinds"" are *separately created*. Under a Creationist paradigm, there is *no* reason to believe that ""kinds"" should be difficult to define… unless you invoke the Great Fudge Factor of ""it was the Creator's unknowable will that it be so"".

Do you understand that It's Hard To Define ""Species"" follows *naturally* from the evolutionary paradigm?

Do you understand that It's Hard To Define ""Species"" *does not* follow naturally from the Creationist paradigm—that the *only* way you even *can* get there, is to invoke the *completely untestable* auxiliary hypothesis of ""Dude, that's just what the Creator felt like doing""?

Do you understand that a paradigm which accounts for a fact *without* needing any auxiliary hypotheses is just objectively *better* than a paradigm which *cannot* account for that fact in the acsence of auxiliary hypotheses?

&gt;&gt; Under a Creationist paradigm, every critter fits into a specific pigeonhole, said pigeonhole being its ""kind"", and no two ""kinds"" are in any way related.

&gt; Not by a long shot. They all share a common Designer, who is presumably crafting the ""kinds"" so they work together.

Please explain how the ""yep, the Designer did it"" hypothesis was tested. Do you know what the null hypothesis was, and how that null hypothesis was disproved?

Please explain how you know that there is *only one* Designer (see also: ""***a*** common Designer""), rather than two, or four, or entire swarms of competing Designers…

&gt; To this end, they can share common design techniques (just as a good programmer keeps a file of already-worked-out solutions to design challenges)…

Hold it. Common design techniques are a *human* response for dealing with *constraints*. Human designers rarely have all the time they need to do everything right; they don't always have free choice of materials; and so on, and so forth.

Are you arguing that your posited Designer *is (or at least was)* operating under constraints analogous to those which *human* designers operate under?

If you *are* arguing that your posited Designer is or was subject to constraints analogous to those which human designers operate under, *how do you know* what those constraints were? If you *don't* know what constraints your posited Designer is or was operating under, *how do you know* how your posited Designer responded to those constraints?

If you're *not* arguing that your posited Designer is or was operating under constraints analogous to those which human designers operate under, why on Earth would your posited Designer *bother* to follow *anything* within bazooka range of human design techniques?

&gt;&gt; You *claim* that you reject evolution on the grounds that it just isn't •detailed* enough…

&gt; No, I don't expect every detail to be described.

Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.

I get that you think the details you demand will *never* be available, but that doesn't alter the fact that *you bloody well* ***are*** *demanding* ***more details*** *than currently exist*. As far as your publicly stated pronouncements go, you bloody well *are* rejecting evolution because it's *not fucking detailed enough*.

&gt; You don't have to.

There you have it, in plain language: The ""supernatural"" is *exempt* from the *same goddamn need for testing* that real scientists demand of ***every*** scientific theory.

&gt; If an argument concludes that an intelligence designed the universe, I'll be happy to let it rest right there. Would you?

No, because the *only* such arguments of which I'm aware are built on the bullshit Two Models framework that you Creationists just fucking *love*. Why do I say that the Teo models framework is bullshit? Because *it has no place for ""eh, beats the heck outta me.""* The bullshit Two Models framework *explicitly* states that *either* it's ~~God~~ the Designer *or* it's naturalistic processes, and there is ***no*** *other option*. I mean, shit, ***Two*** Models, okay?

&gt; The coding of DNA is contingent…

That's nice. What, exactly, *is* the ""specification"" of DNA?

&gt; ID Theory claims that whenever CSI is present, we find that an Intelligent Designer is responsible for the CSI, in every case where the responsible cause is known.

I call bullshit.

ID Theory claims that whenever CSI is present, we find that ~~an Intelligent Designer~~ *a Human Being* is responsible for the CSI, in every case where the responsible cause is known. From this, we can infer that ~~an Intelligent Designer~~ *a Human Being* is responsible when the cause is not known.

Do feel free to explain how come you get to invoke a vague, undefined, *unevidenced* Intelligence in an argument which is allegedly evidence-based.

&gt; This argument… is even used to infer extraterrestrial alien agency (as in the movie ""Contact"").

So we can cite sci-fi to support our position? Groovy! In the *Star Trek: Next Generation* episode *All Good Things…*, it was established that life on Earth began as a result of naturalistic abiogenesis, no Designer need apply.

Do you think *Star Trek* makes for a persuasive argument *against* ID? If you *don't* think *Star Trek* makes for a persuasive argument *against* ID, why on earth would you think that *Contact* is a parsuasive argument *for* ID?",1,1516756831,2018-01-23 20:20:31

- it leads to this: E: ""the ark can't accommodate all extant species we observe today that fit the biblical definition of those that were taken in on the ark, as well as the hundreds of thousands extinct species, which included gigantosaurs, of whom only one single individual already would fill up the whole ark"". C: ""no, no, only of each *kind* a pair was included on the ark, for instance one pair of felines"". E: ""but if only one single pair of felines was included on the ark, there must have been a tremendous amount of evolution taken place because today we have dozens of feline species walking around"". C: &lt;tacit&gt;. But a few days later, same debaters - E: ""The diversity of dog breeds demonstrates evolution"". C: ""no, no, all these dogs are still dogs - they are the same *kind*"".

&gt; Can you assuage my doubts on the existence of all the innumerable mutation/selection steps necessary to genetically link all life?

Assume we have a (small compared to what we see in nature) species population of 10,000 individuals. Assume it's a stable population (it doesn't grow nor decline). Also assume each newborn is hit by 100 mutations in its DNA (something like the mutation rate in humans). Here we go: after one generation 10,000 X 100 = 1,000,000 have accumulated in the *species* genome. After 10,000 generations this piled up to 10,000,000,000 mutations. The human genome contains ~6 billion nucleotides. Most species have smaller genome sizes. 

This calculation shows that genetic mutation at the moderate rate of 100 per generation in rather moderate population sizes already have the potential to change *everything*, that is, each single nucleotide, in the species' genome. You may recalculate for larger (more realistic) population size. And I didn't include multi-nucleotide mutations, where whole chunks of DNA, including entire genes or even whole chromosomes are duplicated or deleted or experience frame shifting. Those will speed up alteration of the DNA even more.

Of course many those mutations also are harmful. But that doesn't matter. We have natural selection:

- of all gametes produced in individual, only a few will be involved to conception. Already in uterus sperm cells compete.

- of all conceptions, most will fail. In humans we know that of all conceptions only 10 lead to life born children.

- of all newborn in most species only a very few reach reproductive age. This can be extreme: in some lobsters of 1,000 born only 1.5 make it to reproductive age. Even before the age of modern medicine it was quite normal for parents to lose 40% of their born children before the age of ~12. We know this from the censuses held by the Roman empire and the parochial birth records that started all over Europe in the middle Ages.

The number of experiments on natural selection is enormous. From lab experiments to field observations. Change the diet of bacteria or fruit flies exposing them to nutrients they could not even metabolize up to now? They WILL adapt, sooner or later. And *much* sooner than later. Biologists are often astounded by the fast rate of evolution. Change environments of guppies by protecting them against predation? In a few years you will spot differences. A lizard species released on an island where they previously didn't live? Within a few decades they changed body size, behavior and diet and even evolved a new valve in their guts. Expose bacteria to antibiotics? They *will* get resistant. In only 15,000 years we already have an astonishing variety of dog breeds - most of them even of much more recent date.

I could go on *for hours* summing up the numerous examples.

There it is, before your own eyes, constant change in traits. and each change *inevitably requires* mutation/steps unless you wish to reset modern genetics and start all over with an alternative theory on heredity.

And indeed all cats share a common ancestor in some feline or felinomorph species somewhere in the Eocene - as those creationists ideas about saving their asses about the ridiculous story of the Ark also unwillingly imply.

You don't have to. If an argument concludes that an intelligence designed the universe, I'll be happy to let it rest right there. Would you?

&gt; What is the specification of DNA?

The coding of DNA is contingent (i.e., not necessitated by anything else; for example, the laws of physics), and yet specifies something that cannot be explained by organic chemistry (in the same way that a motorcycle repair manual specifies something that cannot be explained by the chemistry of ink and paper), namely the construction, maintenance and reproduction of the organism it occupies.

That is DNA's specification.

I did, above.

No, ID Theory does not *assert* that CSI is present in DNA (for example). ID Theory claims that whenever CSI is present, we find that an Intelligent Designer is responsible for the CSI, in every case where the responsible cause is known. From this, we can *infer* that an Intelligent Designer is responsible when the cause is not known. This argument is used in myriad cases where a human is responsible (and stands up in a court of law), and is even used to infer extraterrestrial alien agency (as in the movie ""Contact"").

The methods that Schweitzer utilized to detect are conventional detection methods. They don't leave much wiggle room for questioning the presence of DNA (and not bacterial DNA as well). First, the DNA was only detected in the ""nucleus"" of the ""cells"" in the samples. This rules out bacterial or biofilm DNA. Second, the protein ""histone H4"" was detected. Besides being yet another protein that was detected(!), this protein functions as the ""spool"" upon which DNA wraps to compact it in the nucleus, which only occurs in eucaryotic cells like those of dinosaurs and humans. Third, the stain DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), which lodges in the minor groove of a stable double helix, was employed with positive results (this is especially significant, since DAPI requires a DNA fragment at least 10 bp long to lodge, and that is a fairly long DNA strand to survive even 6000 years, since [this article](https://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555) claims a mere 521-year half-life for DNA, in which half of the bp bonds have broken).

I was and am, I'm just demonstrated that the models flaws actually work in favor of evolution and that accounting for things that Haldane did not take into account for, the dilemma is exacerbated.

&gt;This is what haldanes dilemma is about:

Yeah, Haldane may have forgot about extinctions and founders effects, but these simply cannot account for the magnitude of fixations you need for human evolution(or evolution in higher order animals) to be possible.
&gt; You can't just slap everything into an average

But, if I gave you a range or standard deviation, it would still be a problem for evolution. I mean 93 is the average per generation needed, there wouldn't be that much of a difference if I put a range of 83-103 or even 73-113. And I'm going to demonstrate that punctuated equilibria isnt solving this either.
&gt;I will have fixated the genome going forward.

Again, you may bump up the fixation by a couple of thousand, but 46 million mutations is just not realistic. You simply can't have that many fixations even with such a ridiculously low bottleneck.
&gt;seriously, why is this small population thing not getting to you.

You need to quantify this, that's the problem. You need to demonstrate that 46 million beneficial mutations could fixate in a single or even just a couple of bottlenecks. I can demonstrate that the orders of magnitudes needed for those bottlenecks to solve haldanes dilemma is just unrealistic. Especially when accounting for drift and other factors that put this limit in the low hundreds. Demonstrate that 46 million mutations could be fixated with these bottlenecks or you simply don't have much of an argument against haldanes dilemma.

For example, error detection and correction are made possible by placing valid symbols sufficiently distant in address space. If valid symbols are adjacent, no detection/correction is possible, since a single error can change one valid symbol into another one. But if valid symbols are always at least two locations apart, a single error is always detectable. A ""[parity bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit)"" provides this level of error detection, and is included in many memory systems. If valid symbols are at least four locations apart, double errors can be detected, and single errors can be corrected ([SECDED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code#SECDED)). Error detection/correction coding is an entire discipline in computer design.

If proteins are distant from one another in protein space (and they in fact are *very* distant in many cases), they are very resistant to accidental creation through mutation. Yet the evolution hypothesis claims that *all* proteins have been ""accidentally"" stumbled upon by mutation of other useful proteins. Doesn't pass the smell test, and requires evidence to demonstrate the contrary.

Anyway, even this obfuscating argument is full of flaws and crap on its own:

&gt; Phages have to rely on the replication machinery of the host, is that right? Thus they aren't anywhere near as sensitive to damage by mutation as the genomes of multicellular eukaryotic creatures.

Really? Does the load of mutations in any species' DNA depend on the reproductive strategy of a species? Does the signal of mutations do? Next, bacteriophages have a higher mutation rate than humans. Why are they still here in the first place in the light of genetic entropy then if I may ask?

&gt; not some half-alive/half-dead virus.

Would *this* process, as described by /u/DarinZDF42:

&gt; Say you have a sequence of 10 bases. There are 30 potential point mutations (each base to each other base). Say, just for this example, that for each site, one change is harmful, one is beneficial, and one is neutral. If a site experiences the harmful mutation, that's now off the table. Instead of being 10/10/10 good/bad/neutral, it's 11/9/10, because the back mutation to the ancestral state is now an option. 

not work in the DNA of humans but only in the DNA of bacteriophages? The experiment DarwinZDF42 linked to was about Phage T7, a podovirus that has double-stranded DNA. Why would a harmful mutation in the DNA of Phage T7 not be off the table or lead to the 10/9/10 situation in the way DarwinZDF42 explained? 

&gt; Adaptation toward one environment puts it at risk of dying if there is an environmental change.

Of course it is. That already has been explained well by Darwin: adapt, migrate or get extinct. So irrelevant again. Saying nothing. But more interestingly, I tried to retrieve a study on Goggle by Salthe and Delbert Weins. Whatever query I tried, such a study is not traceable. As Cordova is a habitual liar and it is not the first study he ""linked"" to that does not support his stance whatsoever, also a tactic I encountered dozens of times here on Reddit alone by creationists, I wonder what study this might be and whether it actually bolsters Cordova's arguments.

I have the strong hunch that this study either doesn't exist or isn't supportive of Cordova's arguments or even isn't related to the ongoing subject at all.

41,"Let's look a single site. It's an A. If we limiting our discussion to single-base substitutions for simplicity, we have three options: C, G, and T. 

Using the same breakdown as before, let's say a G is neutral, a C is beneficial, and a T is harmful. 1/1/1. If we have A--&gt;T, our three options now are T--&gt;A, T--&gt;C, and T--&gt;G. The simplest interpretation is now that instead of 1 mutation with each fitness effect, of the three potential mutations, 2 are beneficial (T--&gt;C, and then T--&gt;A, since it's reverse of the initial harmful mutation), and one is neutral (T--&gt;G). So the effects of a single harmful mutation on the potential fitness effects of subsequent mutations is to make beneficial mutations more likely and harmful mutations less likely. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that's an oversimplification in two ways that actual underrepresent the likelihood of beneficial mutations in the second case. 

The first is that if A--&gt;G is neutral and A--&gt;T is harmful, as described above, and A--&gt;T occurs, a subsequent T--&gt;G would actually be *beneficial*, since it was neutral to the ancestral A state. Meaning the above example, *all three* potential mutations following the deleterious A--&gt;T are beneficial relative to the new state.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, we have to consider mutations at other sites. There are mutations called *compensatory mutations*, which is when if you have a harmful mutation at one site, a second mutation at another site can recover that fitness. So the two mutations together will be either neutral or beneficial, even if one or both is harmful individually. This also expands the universe of potentially beneficial mutations following a deleterious mutation. Compensatory mutations are common in antibiotic resistance, which often carries a fitness cost in the absence of the drug, and one reason it's very difficult to get rid of it once it appears.

I'm a Biology student at Miami University. I am a creationist in search of the answers for theistic evolution and yec. I realize this will probably be a flaw for a mod position but I thought I would do my best on the questions. If you feel any of my answers are incorrect please let me know.

1.  A hypothesis is an educated guess to explain a correlation between two variables. It is generally stated as an if...then statement. A hypothesis can never be proven true only supported by evidence.

A theory is a group of ideas to explain a natural phenomena. It has generally been tested and has evidence supporting its ideas. Most logical theories, supported by evidence, are considered true.

A law is a natural constant. It is observable and always true.

2. The theory of Evolution is an explanation for the origin of all species. Evolution is a change in a species overtime that occurs through natural processes (i.e. natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, etc.). The theory of evolution states that every species today evolved from a single celled organism.

3. The law of abiogenesis is the idea of life arising from non living things. To be completely honest I am not very familiar with all of the explanations for this phenomena. It is not included in the Theory of evolution because the theory does not try to explain the origin of life, just the diversity of species today.

4. I'll get back to you on this. At the moment Im fairly sure most mutations are mostly neutral. I learned about mutations, and the fact that they're completely by chance. The ratios on positive and negative I'm not sure of.

61,"&gt;If the family Felidae works as a kind, so be it.

If kind=family, then you're still using the evolutionist classification system. You've just given the phylogenetic term ""family"" a synonym. 

&gt;Can you assuage my doubts on the existence of all the innumerable mutation/selection steps to genetically link all life?

[Genetic material only lasts for under 7 million years, and it stops being readable much earlier.]( https://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555). So you're asking for something that's impossible without the assistance of time-travel. 

What we can do *now* is this: Obtain DNA samples from animals (because plants bore me to death. Sorry, /u/CommanderSheffield!) that are classed in the same genus/clade/family/whatever phylogenetic level you want, and compare the similarity of those samples. This is how we know that hippos are more closely related to whales than they are to pigs. You'll also find that [nearly all life on Earth uses the same 4 nucleotide bases in their DNA. ](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/vgec/highereducation/topics/dna-genes-chromosomes) This is the strongest predictor of common descent we have. If every unique species had different nucleotide bases, that could serve as evidence for creationism, but the fact that we observe near-universal presence of adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine bases confirms evolutionary theory.

What about the outliers? [The only ones I know of are man-made, but they still use the same 4 bases, just that two more new bases have been added into their genetic code.](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-organisms-have-been-formed-using-the-first-ever-6-letter-genetic-code)

63,"&gt;Sure, because the model is unrealisticly biased in favor of evolution. 

I could have sworn you were using the model as an example of how the genes can't be easily distributed. And no, the model isn't biased, it's a model -- and it's not even a particularly accurate one, it is supposed to be used to make inferences.

That is what Haldane's Dilemma is about: selecting for a single attribute is very, very difficult, and there are few scenarios in which they can reach the entire population -- unless, as Haldane noted, there was a near extinction event. So, basically, unless everyone dies, you don't really get fixed genetics, except over very, very long time spans.

&gt; If we're assuming that 46 million mutations being fixated from this one bottleneck, then yes it is. As I demonstrated earlier, you need about 93 beneficial mutations to be fixated per generation (assuming gradualism) to get to humans. 

I have to remind you: you can't just slap everything into an average. Here:

&gt; If we're assuming population bottlenecks throughout this process, then a generation has to fixate greater than 93 mutations (which is already supremely unrealistic) and if we're trying to estimate a low number of population bottlenecks that wouldn't kill off our diverging ancestors, then the amount of mutations that would have to fixate per bottleneck is absurd.

If I kill off every single human except one breeding pair, I will have fixated the genome going forward. There will be only four expressions left, and that's unstable: all it takes is a bit of bad luck and one of those expressions is gone, and there are only three. This is an extinction scenario however -- so let's size it up.

Let's scale up a bit. Huge plague hits. Everyone dies, except a small group. All the people remaining are related to Mick Jagger, who has a unique mutation for resistance and his kids who inherited it.

Each child has half of Mick's material, which suggests between any of Mick's children, they already share 25% of the normally variable sections of the genetic code. We have already reduced the diversity substantially -- which means all these genes are primed to fixate in the coming generations, of incredibly inbred human beings, as the negatives combine and kill themselves off, before our population returns to a stable rate.

It didn't take however many generations it would take for a gene to do this naturally. It took one major die off, and I fixed a huge amount of the genome -- in the case of Mick Jagger, it would fixate the entire Y chromosome along with a substantial portion of the remaining variable code, and really put the X chromosome at risk.

These bottlenecks don't have to be die-offs. Speciation events also produce these rapid collapses in genetic diversity -- or what you call a fixation. And they are going to produce **millions** of fixations, because early species tend to inbreed a lot.

A lot.

64,"&gt;however I believe you are now arguing against the model

Sure, because the model is unrealisticly biased _in_ _favor_ of evolution. Once you account for stuff like genetic drift and stasis, the amount of possible fixations because incredibly smaller. Assuming a gradualistic view actually benefits evolution, as Ill explain later on.
&gt;One bottleneck is unrealistic?

If we're assuming that 46 million mutations being fixated from this one bottleneck, then yes it is. As I demonstrated earlier, you need about 93 beneficial mutations to be fixated per generation (assuming gradualism) to get to humans. If we're assuming population bottlenecks throughout this process, then a generation has to fixate greater than 93 mutations (which is already supremely unrealistic) and if we're trying to estimate a low number of population bottlenecks that wouldn't kill off our diverging ancestors, then the amount of mutations that would have to fixate per bottleneck is absurd. 
&gt;stasis as you understand it doesn't exist. Nothing ever stops evolving,

That's not what I said. Stasis is just the [relative lack of evolutionary change within a population](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199941728/obo-9780199941728-0067.xml). This is most of evolution, as most species are in genetic drift or have low selection pressure for most of the time. Haldanes lack of accounting for this actually props up evolution, because if we factored in stasis then genetic drift gets factored in too which almost always removes beneficial mutations. For example, if a beneficial mutation has a modest selective advantage of 1/10 of a percent, then it'll be eliminated 99.8% just by genetic drift.
&gt;and the conclusions you drew from it are limited

Only limited in that most of the limitations in haldanes model were biased for evolution. Off the top of my head, Walter Remine accounted for these erroneous assumptions and got a number in the hundreds.
&gt;Haldanes limit is how many can fixate without a large scale die-off

As I said, this is still incredibly unrealistic to assume that factoring this in would get you from 1667 mutations to 46 million. And this is ignoring drift which only increases the problem.

As for jeanson, the article only addresses human mutations and doesn't address his points about rapid speciation just being concealed to a couple of tetropod families. But as for what it does address, jeanson noted that nuclear and MtDNA clocks gave vastly different rates of change than nuclear clocks, how this came to be is unknown but I wouldn't ascert this contradiction as a falsification.",1,1516685886,2018-01-23 00:38:06

&gt;A key part of his calculations assumes a stable growth rate is unrealistic. Stasis is just a period of a relative lack of evolutionary change and this ties into him not calculating for genetic drift, which makes his assumptions unrealistic for evolution.

Stasis as you understand it doesn't exist. Nothing stops evolving, only selection pressures changes -- and Haldane doesn't model for changing pressures.

But yes, which is why his model is limited and the conclusions you drew from it are limited. 

&gt;Besides, Haldane puts a limit on how many mutations can fixate.

And once again: Haldane's limit is how many can fixate without a large scale die-off. I gave you two scenarios which produce the same effects on the total genome as die-offs.

&gt;As for jeanson, that whole article is only criticizing his work on mtEve, not on the post flood speciation model.

The [last chimp-human common amcestor]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee%E2%80%93human_last_common_ancestor) lived around 13 million years ago. My 46 million figure comes from [Larry Morgan's blog](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2014/04/breaking-news-creationist-vincent.html?showComment=1396459508015&amp;m=1#c3928367699865279715)
&gt;for one species to drift into another

If by drift, you mean genetic drift, then Id have to accuse you of commiting the equivocation fallacy. He assumed gradualism in his calculations and ignored genetic drift. This is key, as drift will remove beneficial mutations and is inhibiting towards fixation in this case.

&gt;What do you mean by stasis?

A key part of his calculations assumes a stable growth rate is unrealistic. Stasis is just a period of a relative lack of evolutionary change and this ties into him not calculating for genetic drift, which makes his assumptions unrealistic _for_ evolution.

&gt;fixation events suggest the founders affect.

But that many, for _46_ _million_ mutations? Most of evolution is spent in stasis and in genetic drift, so such an unrealistic amount of population bottlenecks are impossible.
&gt;genetic recombination isn't linearly modelled

This just hand waves my model here. You don't necessarily explain how the ""geometric"" modelling of recombination refutes the central point of the model, which is you would you need to have way to mutations fixating per generation for evolution to be possible. 93 mutations approximately
&gt; in humans? Can't be done

Sure it can, there are tons of HLA alleles, by simple recombination of these you could get your variation in the time required by the flood model. Besides, Haldane puts a limit on how many mutations can _fixate_. I suspect most of these HLA genes aren't fixated throughout the whole population and are just in small clumps, so I don't think it's a problem for noahs flood.

As for jeanson, that whole article is only criticizing his work on mtEve, not on the post flood speciation model. It really addresses absolutely none of his points, and I think I even linked the article. ",1,1516671472,2018-01-22 20:37:52

84,"&gt; Under a Creationist paradigm, every critter fits into a specific pigeonhole, said pigeonhole being its ""kind"", and no two ""kinds"" are in any way related.

Not by a long shot. They all share a common Designer, who is presumably crafting the ""kinds"" so they work together. To this end, they can share common design techniques (just as a good programmer keeps a file of already-worked-out solutions to design challenges), and of course, they will share many characteristics necessary for their common existence (for example, all proteins will share the same handedness so that predators can eat and digest their prey).

&gt; You claim that you reject evolution on the grounds that it just isn't detailed enough

No, I don't expect every detail to be described. But it is a genuine concern that pathways *do not exist*. We find proteins — many, many proteins — that are so remotely situated in protein space that it is unrealistic to think that the many necessary functional intermediate proteins, created by random mutations, would exist. All these intermediates must be functional (OK, some may ride on the backs of other beneficial mutations to separate genes that reside on the same genetic block, but that's a stretch if overused as an explanation), and the mutations must be plausibly probable.

If this could be demonstrated, you can rest assured that some geneticist would have used his government grant funds to document it. Hasn't happened. Not once. Yet, it is *assumed* that this has happened in nature literally trillions of times.

And analogies leave the evolutionists high and dry. Although evolutionists employ English language text modification via typo to illustrate their evolution theory where possible (most notably, John Maynard Smith's famous GENE =&gt; GONE =&gt; GORE =&gt; WORE =&gt; WORD evolution), this totally breaks down when applied to a realistic parallel (such as an entire paragraph, and where an entire book would be a more fair analogy).",1,1516665632,2018-01-22 19:00:32

86,"&gt;&gt; Whatever, dude. I am completely okay with people coming up with new terminology—as long as they friggin' define their new terminology.

&gt; The definition of the term species, usually defined as a set of organisms that can interbreed, is not fully agreed upon either, and constantly changes with new data (and what do you do with asexual species?).

Yes, there is no universally-applicable, one-size-fits-all One True Species Definition. And for any species definition that anyone has yet come up with, there *are* critters to which that species definition just doesn't apply.

Why should this be so? *Why* is it difficult to define species?

Under an evolutionary paradigm, in which new species arise as a result of accumulated changes in their genealogical lineage, it makes perfect sense that there would be critters that have *both* distinctive features of the ancestral species *and* distinctive features of the descendant species. And these critters would be *genuinely difficult* to classify. So under an evolutionary paradigm, it *makes sense* that species would be hard to define.

Under a Creationist paradigm, every critter fits into a specific pigeonhole, said pigeonhole being its ""kind"", and *no two ""kinds"" are in any way related*. *All* ""kinds"" are *separately created*. Under a Creationist paradigm, there is *no* reason to believe that ""kinds"" should be difficult to define… unless you invoke the Great Fudge Factor of ""it was the Creator's unknowable will that it be so"".

&gt;&gt; Can you, or can you not, tell what ""kind"" (aka ""baramin"") a random critter belongs to?

&gt; The answer is the same as it is for evolutionists and their classification system: Usually, yes. All domestic cats, plus lions, tigers, leopards, pumas, and many others belong to the cat kind. But there are many animals that will have to wait for more data before classifying.

Why?

According to you Creationists, *all* the ""kinds"" are *already* on the table—there aren't *any* **new** ""kinds"". Now, I get that you Creationists have caught up to real science to the extent that you accept change *within* a ""kind"". But surely *that* sort of thing shouldn't make it difficult to decide *which* ""kind"" a critter belongs to? At most, it should do no more than make it a bit harder to determine exactly where a critter fits *within* its ""kind""; why should it be hard to determine *which frickin' ""kind"" the critter* ***belongs*** *to!?*

&gt; Can you assuage my doubts on the existence of all the innumerable mutation/selection steps necessary to genetically link all life?

I call bullshit.

You *claim* that you reject evolution on the grounds that it just isn't *detailed* enough, but at the same time, you accept Creationism, which consists largely (if not entirely) of knowledge-gaps that you've spackled over with a hearty helping of ""God did it"".

I'm not sure what level of detail would be the Creationist equivalent of the ""let's see *every last mutation*"" detail-level you demand of evolution… but I am confident that *Creationism doesn't* ***have*** *that level of detail*.

This is just some variation of the tornado in a junkyard argument. If house parts reproduced with variation and environmental pressures existed that favored houses, you'd have a case but acting like evolution/abiogenesis doesn't work because literal inanimate objects don't turn themselves into a complex final product is just silly. 

I don't know who told you this argument but I'd recommend doing some outside research on the subject because that person clearly doesn't understand what they're talking about.

The first thing that was alive would have been a simple self replicating molecule like RNA. The thing about molecules is that there's various laws in chemistry and physics describing how different molecules are naturally attracted to each other and can form bonds. This is important because it means that given enough time such as quite a few million years in early Earth conditions, these bonds could form naturally. This is unlike a house which specifically needs people to build them because all of the parts don't form naturally. Even when they're specifically fitted for each other by people, they still require things like nails and welding and concrete and all sorts of things to keep it together.

122,"I thought [you have read Felsenstein](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7rtkqp/creationists_have_you_ever_read_a_book_on/dszoe4v/). If you HAD read Felsenstein, you must have noticed that:

1. very most mutations are neutral.

2. only of the remainder a majority is deleterious.

3. the rest is beneficial.

4. the fact that the majority of mutations that hit functional DNA and are deleterious (2.) is not much of a ado because natural selection weeds out such mutations. The reason is because such mutations ARE deleterious: they cause harm and *therefore* affect the survival and/or reproduction chances of the unlucky individuals carrying them. And with those unlucky individuals dying before their reproductive age or failing to pass sexual selection, the deleterious mutations exit the *species* genome. they dug their own grave so to say.

5. dozens of experiments on natural selection have demonstrated that beneficial mutations do occur. For instance when you expose bacteria to different nutrients they normally cannot process and deprive them from their regular diet, they almost inevitably adapt and ""learn"" to metabolize the new food source. That shows beneficial mutations must have occurred. Especially when many of these experiments even have detected what changed in the bacterial DNA where exactly on the genome and what consequences such changes had on the biochemistry of the metabolic pathways.

6. the fossil record shows that biodiversity changed throughout geological time, it is a come and go of hundreds of thousands species, genera, classes, orders and even phyla. Of extant life you can't find almost nothing back in, say, Ediacaran formations. And Ediacaran biota are almost science fiction to us. There are also dozens instances of mass extinction observable from which life again and again recovered. That implies *zillions* of beneficial mutations having happened, otherwise there could be no biodiversity changing or recovering.

127,"&gt; Whatever, dude. I am completely okay with people coming up with new terminology—as long as they friggin' define their new terminology.

The definition of the term species, usually defined as a set of organisms that can interbreed, is not fully agreed upon either (and what do you do with asexual species?).

&gt; Can you, or can you not, tell what ""kind"" (aka ""baramin"") a random critter belongs to?

The answer is the same as it is for evolutionists and their classification system: Usually, yes. All domestic cats, plus lions, tigers, leopards, pumas, and many others belong to the cat kind. But there are many animals that will have to wait for more data before classifying. Similarly, evolutionists have a hierarchical classification system that organizes most living organisms (and with which creationists concur as a mere classification system). But many placements are questionable, and new discoveries often identify completely novel life forms.

I don't want to continue this discussion much further because, as I said, this is not my area of focus. I have bigger, or different, fish to fry.

128,"&gt; But it does, it makes the statement that the cost of substitution (through haldanes calculations) limits the potential amount of fixating beneficial mutations in the time between human-chimp ancestors and humans at about 1667 mutations.

Which ancestor? These figures, they aren't coming from a vacuum -- where did you find them?

&gt;I don't know were you're getting this, Haldane never accounted for the fact that a species may be in stasis. 

Haldane produced a calculation for the time required for one species to drift into another, using some example rates -- it was just a good example of how his system worked. 

And what do you mean by stasis? A large part of his theory requires the population to be in stable growth.

&gt;Also, how many possible extinction events would you need to fixate 46 million mutations?

In a gene code of 3B elements: one? It's really not that many elements. Fixation events suggest the Founder effect, so it would only require a modest population bottleneck.

&gt;know divide 46 million by 500k and you get 92 mutations being fixated per generation. That's absurdly high, especially if we're going by punctuated equilibria which is what your suggesting which would require us to assume unstable fitness landscapes so some generations would fixate 100 mutations or more.

Ah, yeah. Okay, you need to stop using averages like that. Genetic recombination isn't linearly modelled -- it's geometric.

&gt;This depends on how many mutations it would take you to get from a post flood common ancestor to all the species around today.

In humans? It can't be done. The gene [HLA-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-B) is one of the most diverse in humans: there are literally thousands of variants. According to Haldane, or even common sense statistical modelling, there's not enough time to produce these variants since Noah.

As for Nate: [his research is flawed.](http://www.evoanth.net/2016/05/23/invent-mutation-rate/)",1,1516598973,2018-01-22 00:29:33
129,"&gt;Haldanes dilemma makes no statements about the arising of beneficial mutations

But it does, it makes the statement that the cost of substitution (through haldanes calculations) limits the potential amount of fixating beneficial mutations in the time between human-chimp ancestors and humans at about 1667 mutations.
&gt;and projects a speciation rate due to drift alone

I don't know were you're getting this, Haldane never accounted for the fact that a species may be in stasis. He assumed non stop evolution (predating punctuated equilibria) which is contrary to calculating for genetic drift. Plus, drift is an obstacle to the fixation of a beneficial mutation, assuming more of it as Haldane did would've reduced the amount of possible beneficial mutations. 
&gt;These mutations fixed over numerous speciation events. A colony of 1000 individuals can carry 2000 variants, but assuming a stable population, diversity collapses rapidly, expecting 25% loss in the first generation. This diversity would continue to drop, until mutations overwhelm that.

We have dozens of distinct ancestors who all went through their own extinction events. We can't even agree how many humans have ever lived, we have no idea the total genetic mass it took to get here.

Again, haldane's dilemma already sets a limit on this. Also, how many possible extinction events would you need to fixate 46 million mutations? Really, we're talking about 10 million years here and a substitution rate of 1 beneficial mutation/300 generations, I cannot see that many extinction events happening to possibly fixate that many mutations. Such an unstable fitness landscape would contradict evolution and make it inconsistent. This is because, in order for such an unstable fitness landscape to occur that could cause all of those extinction events, selection would fixate a beneficial mutation that would later be deleterious and harmful and deleterious mutations would be selected out that could've been useful. 
&gt; we have no idea the total genetic mass it took to get here.

No but we know the mutations. It's supposedly been about 10 million years since our human-chimp common ancestors. The amount of time a generation would last is about 20 years. divide 10m/20 and we get 500k generations. know divide 46 million by 500k and you get 92 mutations being fixated per generation. That's absurdly high, especially if we're going by punctuated equilibria which is what your suggesting which would require us to assume unstable fitness landscapes so some generations would fixate 100 mutations or more. It's just not possible.
&gt;In any case, I could turn Haldane's dilemma on Noah, if you'd like. 4000 years is optimistically 200 generations, which according to Haldane could not result in the population diversity we see today, as the mutation rate is not high enough.

This depends on how many mutations it would take you to get from a post flood common ancestor to all the species around today. There have been several models of speciation, but according to [nathaniel jeanson](https://answersingenesis.org/natural-selection/speciation/clocks-imply-linear-speciation-rates-within-kinds/) a linear model of speciation seems to have occured. He finds that among 151 mammalian families( out of the 153 that exist) about 75% have have &lt;21 species. a modest speciation event every 200 years would get us to that level. about 27% of mammal families hold about  86% of mammalian species, and we have to remember that domestication and artificial selection are probably ample reasons for the other quarter of mammal families. All other tetropods seem to fit this scenerio, implying linear speciation.
Also, you would have to demonstrate haldanes dilemma within a commonly accepted baramin ancestor and current species now.

Wait....so let's see...I asked you for an example of random mutation and natural selection working together to adapt a population genetically.   what you've given me is a pop science article where even admits that scientists don't know how it happened.   They also admit that lactose persistence, which would enable a person to tolerate the sugar in the milk and thus not spend their lives vomiting otherwise getting sick from the milk consumption, was probably accomplished via repeated exposure and/or consuming yogurt.  This probably switched some genes on that allowed the instant, or near instant, capacity to tolerate milk.  This of course, shoots down the whole, notion of natural selection if all individuals can generate their own adaptive tolerance. aka nobody dies or fails to be able to breed. If we can do this now, then people could do it 7000 years ago....ha!

and of course there's this other little pesky problem for you that within our guts we have trillions of little bacteria, some of which, carry a certain gene that we can borrow from to confer the ability to digest the lactose  http://7bigspoons.com/bacteria/overcome-lactose-intolerance-borrow-lactase-bugs/

So I've already shot down your natural selection ""evidence,"" -- which you didn't actually present any evidence anyway......but in regards to the genetics itself, it turns out that the trait was initially cause, if I'm remembering correctly, from multiple SNPs, not just a single mutation.  and for a trait that supposedly arose very quickly just a few thousand years ago on the heals of farming cows and drinking lots of milk, there is no way multiple SNPs could arise, by chance, in that short amount of time.  Not when the genome is billions of locations for which mutations could take place. One might argue that a single, lucky mutation could happen that quickly, but multiple mutations?  No

So OF COURSE, if you are going to try to convince me or any other sane person of your wacky theory, you need to be able show a lineage, a successive line of fossils leading from bears to something else other than bears... because THAT'S WHAT YOUR THEORY SAYS!   LOL  You are running away from the obvious need for such evidence because you know there isn't any -- for any creature.  take something else -- elephants....giraffes, rhinos...cows...horses...cats...dogs..kangaroos...humans....etc etc etc....they all vary within their own kind, but your side can never show that they gradually transformed from something else.

Yet this gradual evolution is exactly what you believe in.  Not to mention that you don't have a valid mechanism to make it happen.  Your side can't even identify what mutations would transform a moth into a butterfly or a honey bee into a wasp, much less what would transform a rat-like common ancestor into an elephant or a giraffe or human.   Give me a break.

Trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) is a serine protease from the PA clan superfamily, found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where it hydrolyzes proteins.[2][3] Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline.[4] It is used for numerous biotechnological processes. The process is commonly referred to as trypsin proteolysis or trypsinisation, and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized.[5] **Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kühne.[6]**",1,1516563678,2018-01-21 14:41:18

&gt; But note that these genetic changes are not “evolution” in the uphill molecules-to-milkman sense, as the changes are downhill, i.e., information has been lost (viz., the normal switching-off mechanism of lactase production following weaning).12 Rather, at best this is an example of selection, as Hirschhorn himself went on to acknowledge: “Lactase persistence has always been a textbook example of selection, and now it’ll be a textbook example in a totally different way.”10
&gt; Although the loss of the ability to turn off lactase production following weaning is a loss of information (i.e. a downhill change), the mutation confers some obvious advantages in areas where milk is available. The ‘cost’ of the mutation, i.e., the extra energy needed to continue to produce lactase beyond infancy, would be more than compensated for by being able to safely extract the energy and nutrients in milk

Moreover, biochemistry by definition is not random, it's governed by physical laws.

The second part of your question:

&gt; If even more parts that would fit into a more complex house would be laid down together by accident, how long would it take nature to form a more complex house by accident? Would it be reasonable to believe it’s possible? Why/why not?

is actually referring to evolution. Because adding more parts after the initial offset is within the era of evolution.

No one claims that abiogenesis created organisms with anything approaching the complexity of the life forms we see today. The first life would have been less complex than even the simplest of viruses are today.

An equivalent analogy might be to ask if nature could create something much, much simpler than a house, but which could still serve the function of a dwelling.

Maybe something like a cave. It lacks modern conveniences, but does the job of keeping the rain off you and is a good place to keep your stuff.

 &gt; But note that these genetic changes are not “evolution” in the uphill molecules-to-milkman sense, as the changes are downhill, i.e., information has been lost (viz., the normal switching-off mechanism of lactase production following weaning).12 Rather, at best this is an example of selection, as Hirschhorn himself went on to acknowledge: “Lactase persistence has always been a textbook example of selection, and now it’ll be a textbook example in a totally different way.”10

&gt; Although the loss of the ability to turn off lactase production following weaning is a loss of information (i.e. a downhill change), the mutation confers some obvious advantages in areas where milk is available. The ‘cost’ of the mutation, i.e., the extra energy needed to continue to produce lactase beyond infancy, would be more than compensated for by being able to safely extract the energy and nutrients in milk

Would it be reasonable to believe it is possible, why/why not?

It would be sheer impossible. But it's not relevant pertaining evolution. Because evolution isn't a process that happens by accident. In evolution the mechanism of natural selection rules out it to be accidental.

The best way to illustrate this is by doing two experiments:

1. you roll 10,000 dice and calculate the odds of all of them returning 6s. No doubt this will take you probably until the end of times to perform. The odds of this outcome is 1/6^10000.

Experiment 1 resembles the odds of nature assembling a house by accident out of all of its lose parts.

but now let's introduce selection:

2. you roll 10,000 dice but every time a 6 returns, you replace that die and only continue with the rest. That experiment will be done *within a few hours*.

this experiment is better simulating what evolution is all about.

&gt; If even more parts that would fit into a more complex house would be laid down together by accident, how long would it take nature to form a more complex house by accident? Would it be reasonable to believe it’s possible? Why/why not?

Basically, evolution on any scale isnt random. Natural selection basically ensures that the animals least fit to survive die, and the animals most fit to survive.....survive. 



So while mutation and gene arrangement may be random, which mutations and gene arrangements survive is not.  Furthermore, mutations and genes are hereditary which allows the genes from the surviving organism to pass on, recombine, and undergo new mutations and natural selection

- the way how the top vertebrae are appended to the skull and the location of that joint, because from that you can tell whether the species was walking upright or on four limbs like gorilla ad chimpanzees do.

- the volume of the brain. We observe a gradual gain in cranial volume in the fossil evidence over time.

- the relative size of the molars and jaws.

283,"1 . An hypothesis typically refers to a scientific proposition which may or may not have become widely accepted. 

A theory often refers to a widely accepted hypothesis or set of hypotheses. This differs from the colloquial usage of the word ""theory"", exemplified in the phrase ""just a theory"" which refers to an idea which has not been tested, or perhaps which hasn't become widely accepted. 

A law is a widely accepted description of particular regularities in nature. talkorigins writes that ""Generally speaking, scientific theories differ from scientific laws only in that laws can be expressed more tersely.""

2 . The history of life on earth is that of a steady diversification into the forms currently seem today. The theory of evolution attempts to describe the patterns of descent and mechanisms of change that have occurred during this history. While there is some question about whether there may have been independently arising primitive types of life at the base of the ""tree"" of common ancestry, it is thought that all currently existing forms of life share a common ancestor some 3.5-8 billion years ago.

3 . Abiogenesis refers to the initial origin of life. Because evolutionary biology refers to existing populations, the mechanisms involved in abiogenesis are quite different to those involved in evolution.

4 . I don't know. If we are referring to the effect on reproductive fitness, then won't that be, to some degree, dependent on the environment in which the mutation occurs?

284,"And that seriously makes you think that phylogeny is busted? even if that article is interpreting that paper correctly the big point is that crossbreeding happens, there is a reason that paleontologists tend to group creatures by genus.  That the points of separation in the tree of life can be fuzzy is not a new idea, and it definitely does not overturn phylogeny. 

The quote from Eric Bapteste 
&gt;""We have no evidence at all that the tree of life is a reality,""

Seems like a quote mine given what he writes in the description of his  2009 paper titled ['Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things'](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-4-34)

&gt;The concept of a tree of life is prevalent in the evolutionary literature. It stems from attempting to obtain a grand unified natural system that reflects a recurrent process of species and lineage splittings for all forms of life. Traditionally, the discipline of systematics operates in a similar hierarchy of bifurcating (sometimes multifurcating) categories. The assumption of a universal tree of life hinges upon the process of evolution being tree-like throughout all forms of life and all of biological time. **In multicellular eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms and species-level population genetics of variation do indeed mainly cause a tree-like structure over time**. In prokaryotes, they do not. **Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things**, and we need to treat them as such, rather than extrapolating from macroscopic life to prokaryotes. In the following we will consider this circumstance from philosophical, scientific, and epistemological perspectives, surmising that phylogeny opted for a single model as a holdover from the Modern Synthesis of evolution.

(emphasis mine)

&gt;Last year, scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington found a strange chunk of DNA in the genetic make-up of eight animals, including the mouse, rat and the African clawed frog. The same chunk is missing from chickens, elephants and humans, suggesting it must have become wedged into the genomes of some animals by crossbreeding. 

I found a Bioslogos comment chain that barely touched on it, but even if that was true wouldn't that completely break YEC's baraminalogy?, I mean rats and frogs are definitely not the same ""kind"" as each other.

These adaptations include retraction of the fleshy nostrils to a position near the mid-region of the skull and an elongate neck and trunk that shift the center of body mass anterior to the knee joint. **Unlike terrestrial theropods,** the pelvic girdle is downsized, the hindlimbs are short, and all of the limb bones are solid without an open medullary cavity,** for buoyancy control in water.** The short, robust femur with hypertrophied flexor attachment and the low, flat-bottomed pedal claws are **consistent with aquatic foot-propelled locomotion**.

But I'm a creationist, and also not a scientist but I did take biology as my major subject before graduating. I'm a forest warden. Anyways here are my answers, don't spank me for my english I'm german:

1. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for something we observe, for it to be a scientific one it needs to be testable. Next up if we provisionally accept the hypothesis as a basis for further research it becomes a working hypothesis. A scientific theory is an explanation for a phenomenon that has surpassed rigorous and repeated testing using the scientific method (for example a scientific hypothesis that withstands criticism, confirms and produces correct predictions and has a satisfying amount of explanatory power). A scientific law is simply a statement that always holds true when describing a phenomenon. It's much stricter and often on a smaller scale than a scientific theory. As an example a scientific theory can contain several scientific laws but not the other way around.

2. The theory of evolution is a scientific theory that tries to explain and understand the current biodiversity we see on our earth today. It also postulates that all life on earth shares a common ancestor. The main process described in the theiry of evolution is evolution via natural selection.

3. Abiogenesis is the working hypothesis that life on earth arised from non-living matter in a natural process. It's postulated to have been a gradual event and is based on knowledge in chemistry etc. Why is it not described by the theory of evolution? It certainly belongs into the realm of biology/biochemistry/chemistry, but the theory of evolution does technically not bother to explain the origin of all life, it merely tries to explain the current biodiversity of all life which entails common ancestry, whicb isn't influenced by the question how the most common ancestor arised.

4. Well I definitely had to look that up but who wouldn't? I'm guessing you meant ""What are the mutation ratios per generation?"" right, because otherwise it wouldn't make sense. I hope so. Anyways [this source](http://sandwalk.blogspot.ch/2015/04/human-mutation-rates-whats-right-number.html) from a blogger whom I follow tells me it's ~100 mutations per generation. I'm not a scientist so I have to pass on searching how many are neutral/positive/negative I'm really sorry. But just from what I've read here and on other sites I'm guessing the answer is going to be more or less 95% are neutral, maybe 4% negative and 1% positive, maybe positive/negative are evenly split but the main point should be that most are neutral, right?

329,"&gt; Typical evolutionist equivocation. Just because creatures share features doesn't mean a transitional was actually found. 

And Cordova is **deceiving** again by *deliberately* distorting what paleontology is actually saying and implying.

Fossils are NOT transitional because they share features but because they have features BOTH of the ancestral organism AND the descendant organism. Tiktaalik has traits that are entirely fish-like AND features that are unique for tetrapods. They also had BOTH gills AND lungs which is extremely transitional. NOBODY in paleontology implies that transitional is defined as ""sharing traits"". NOBODY. 

Here's the next lie, same paragraph of just 3 lines of text:

&gt; The Sarcopterygii crown group doesn't have actual transitionals from the Sarcopterygii to the fish, only a hypothetical Tetrapodomorpha that isn't Tiktaalik.

First of all, the Sarcopterygii constitute a class of bony fish. Thus it just makes no sense to talk about ""transition from Sarcopterygii to fish"" because it would be about a transition from descendant to ancestor. But let's assume this was just lousy writing and a mishap and that was meant the transition from Sarcopterygii to tetrapods. Even then it's just a lie.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapodomorpha#Relationships) is a list of transitional species of the lobed-finned fish to tetrapod transition, comprising HUNDREDS of species, including early tetrapods with still clear fish-like traits to lobed-finned fish with clear tetrapod features and EVERYTHING in between and comprising ALL relevant traits for such transition.

When land animals die they get bloated by decomposition, boosting buoyancy considerably, and picked up by rising river water (after rain caused the river to swell) and transported to the sea. There they are deposited and preserved just like marine organisms often are preserved and found back fossilized.

Consequently, dinosaur fossils found in marine environments like in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Chalk (Kansas) formation are found with bite marks by sharks.

When birds die while flying over the sea at the moment of death, they will fall into the water and for the rest will be preserved the same way as depicted above.

343,"I especially like the ""stasis"" argument because it's a direct (though unintentional) refutation of ""genetic entropy"" silliness.

Here's how:

You have big animals that have been very very similar for many millions of years. The way they do that is via two types of selection. *Purifying selection* is natural selection against new non-synonymous substitutions, which preserves existing genotypes. *Stabilizing selection* is selection against extreme phenotypes, preserving the middle range of a distribution of variation for a trait. Working together, these two types of select very efficiently *keep things the same*. That's not to say no evolution is happening; these are evolutionary processes. The outcome is simply preserving a well-adapted existing state. 

Now if look at a ""genetic entropy"" argument, the thing I just described shouldn't be possible. We hear over and over how selection isn't strong enough to preserve traits and keep fitness high over tens or hundreds of millions of years. 

Except that exactly what we observe here. Not because evolution isn't happening, but because a few very specific evolutionary processes *are* happening.

Step two: Modify one of the already-extant parts so that the now-modified part won't work in the absence of the new part. That's a perfectly good route to Behean irreducible complexity.

Thank you, I think something has clicked for me...

This system would still have a viable reduced state, even if it is time asymmetric, so therefore it isn't actually irreducibly complex - not in a way that conflicts with evolution.

It would seem that IC may be an invalid concept entirely because nearly any system with multiple components has at least one viable reduced state and only very simple systems would have no viable reduced state.

The complexity itself seems to be the factor that allows for an evolutionary process to create such systems; The more variables in the system mean more possible configurations and thus more potential viable reduced states, whereas a simple system has fewer viable configurations and therefore fewer viable reduced states.

***Every one*** of those verses says, exactly and precisely, ***""there is no God""***. If you believe the Bible is true, *obviously* your only recourse is to convert to atheism. Right?

Well… no.

While it's true that Deuteronomy 32:39 *does* include the character string ""there is no God"", it's equally true that that verse includes rather a few *other* characters. The *entire* verse, with ""there is no God"" italicized, is as follows:

&gt; See now that I, even I, am he, and *there is no god* with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.

Do you see that ripping the character string *there is no God* out of Deuteronomy 32:39, and presenting that character string *as if* it were 'evidence' that the Bible says god doesn't exist, is nonsense?",1,1516420213,2018-01-19 22:50:13

This has nothing to do with evolution. /r/debateanatheist is that way 
------&gt;

&gt;Since the BDMNP superintends over your science, it cannot itself be scientific, and furthermore, your science only considers natural causes as candidates for the causes of natural phenomena, even though you cannot rule out supernatural causation.

I notice that despite not being able to rule out supernatural causation, there's never been a point where supernatural causation was the best answer. There's certainly never been a point where we assumed something had a naturalistic answer but a supernatural one ended up being the better answer. 

In fact, every single time it's been the exact opposite. Every. Single. Time. 

&gt;Again, you cannot rule out supernatural agency; therefore you must be able to deal with the possibility of existential supernatural causation in our natural world.

If a naturalistic explanation is able to account for a phenomenon, there's literally no reason to assume a supernatural one on top of that. You're only adding unreasonable unproven crap on top of a perfectly reasonable explanation under the flimsy guide of ""Well you can't disprove it.""

If that's what you have to fall back on, you've already lost. 

&gt;So, let's assume for a moment that a supernatural agent did in fact kick-start (i.e., was the cause of) the first life.

No.

&gt;What would your science look like in this case?

Figure out where the supernatural thing came from. 

You're not as smart as you think you are. You think life had a supernatural origin? Fucking prove it. Justify your beliefs. don't fall back on ""Bu bu bu bu bu you can't DISprove it!!!!"" like some sniveling cretin.

It's just that darn, pesky evidence making it so hard for evolutionists.

The moon could be made by Lovecraft monsters and it wouldn't mean one thing or another for the theory of evolution. And yeah, wanting to explain things through clear natural processes is literally the basis for all of science. Congratulations, you've barely caught up with Galileo. 

&gt;Just answering according to folly. If you are such fervent devotees of evolution, then why are you here... posting... with creationists? 

Because conversations and debate are capable of changing minds and often times creationists have a very skewed understanding of what evolution even is due to only hearing things about it from other incredibly uninformed creationists. Such misunderstandings like the formation of the moon having didley dick to do with evolution. 

&gt;Where is the survival value of your actions?

The less people who deny basic science, the better for society over all. 

&gt;Why are you not feverishly reproducing right now to spread your dna across the planet? ;-)

Because people who are scientifically literate are more likely to understand the concept of overpopulation than people who aren't. You act like this is a major ""gotcha"" moment but if you spent time actually asking scientifically literate people these questions in good faith rather than just trying to strawman their position, you'd learn that just because something is a fact of nature (living creatures exist to reproduce) doesn't mean that has to be unquestionable role for every individual. Humans are capable of making their own destinies.

I think DarwinDZF42 and TheBlackCat13 already zoomed in well on your post.

I have no problem someone saying that DNA codes for proteins or regulates upstream genes thus it could be studied by means of information theory. In that sense DNA could be regarded as ""information"".

But you have all kinds of information. A book contains information. So does a data file on a computer. Or a computer program. Or a road sign. Or DNA.

Are these different sources of information the same? In other words, to leave out DNA for a moment, is the way information is processed in a book the same as, for instance, a computer program? Certainly not. A book conveys information very differently than a computer program. A book does not convey information to steer processes like computer programs do. Books are to explain things or just tell nice or thrilling stories like in novel. Computer programs certainly don't. They are not even readable for the naked eye when still in machine language.

Other sources of information than DNA already are mutually discordant. You just can't transplant or apply conclusions drawn from information source A to information source B.

The information processed in a computer program is quite different from DNA. Computer programs are not subject to random mutation (unless evolutionary simulation models!). DNA by contrast is. As DarwinZDF42 explained, computer models are not exposed to selection. Generally, subroutines are not able to copy themselves spontaneously. Etc.

431,"&gt; If creationists remark on actual peer-reviewed published work that, in our opinion, can be interpreted as supporting the creation perspective, it's labeled ""quote mining"" and downvoted.

Unfortunately, they almost always TURN OUT to be quote mines. And I most often see evolutionists explaining why it's a quote mine, linking to the original sources thus proving it's a quote mine. If you don't want evolutionaists to do so, CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOUR.

&gt; If we name established figures that were once respected members of the evolutionist community and possessed all the necessary credentials (PhD., published papers, professorship at a secular university, productive research at a commercial enterprise) who are bold enough to risk their careers by expressing their opinion that creation has validity, it's labeled ""argument from authority"", even though you routinely defend your side by rejecting any argument that is not made by an ""authority"", rather that discussing the argument itself.

If you say that genetic entropy is true because Sanford, a plant geneticist has coined it, it IS an argument from authority. Don't mock about evolutionists, change your behaviour.

&gt; If we point out that both sides use the same data (almost exclusively data collected by evolutionists themselves, since only they are awarded government grants) and it is only the ""perspective"" or filter through which the data is interpreted that is different, that's worth a downvote.

Actually it is NOT evolutionists that talk about the ""perspective"" but CREATIONISTS. Evolutionists almost never use that argument and just explain why the creationist ""perspective"" doesn't hold ground. Don't accuse evolutionists for YOUR OWN mischief.

&gt; If we attempt to use analogies to make our point (such as showing that mutation/selection is inadequate to explain the supposed evolution of the information in DNA by demonstrating that it does not work for English text, even when guided by intelligence, and even when the source and target texts are carefully chosen, and even though it has never been demonstrated for DNA itself), that's a downvote.

But that's not what happens. Analogies are ONLY to *elucidate* what you try to say. Creationists are ABUSING analogies by saying that ""because"" a hurricane cannot randomly assemble a 747 in a scrapyard, evolution ""also"" ""must"" be untrue. There is an ENORMOUS distinction between an analogy and an argument. Also, although every analogy somehow falls short, WHEN you use an analogy, it must be a reasonable one that reflects the thing you want to elucidate rather adequately. But your 747 scrapyard example HAS NOTHING TO DO with evolutionary processes. Both are *alien* to each other. So apart from abusing analogy as *argument*, you also apply lousy examples as analogy.

&gt; Pointing out the obvious difference between micro-evolution (Mendelian recombination) and macro-evolution (creation of entirely different body plans via typographical errors) is prohibited and earns a downvote.

Because the way creationists define micro and macro, it IS NOT an ""obvious"" difference. It's a NON-EXISTENT difference. The way creationists define both is fallacious, wrong and flawed. The term ""Mendelian recombination"" already is entirely out of place here. Macro evolution is NOT about ""entirely different body plans"" but primarily about *speciation*. ""Typographical"" errors is wrong wording. Moreover, this has been corrected *zillion* times over the last *decades*. I just rectified you for the zillion-first time. Congrats. You just earned a downvote by me. Because after this decades of rectifications it now falls within by range of downvoting: TROLLING.

&gt; Having an incomplete definition of the term ""kind"", awaiting further data to better determine its definition (when the very same is done, not just with ""species"", but all the way up the classification scheme) is a downvotable foul.

You NEVER will get more precise definitions of ""species"". The reason is not that evolution theory is lousily defined but because nature herself refutes precise definitions. The boundaries between species ARE blurred and vague. A fact that is predicted by evolution theory.

But agree, creationists pointing out to that, although for flawed reasons, is not a foul and not subject to downvoting. So you have a reasonable point here.

&gt; Pointing out the obvious story-telling that occurs when terms like ""convergence"" and ""stasis"" are applied in an after-the-fact ad-hoc manner to patch up blatant holes in evolutionist explanations is a downvote.

That's worth a second downvote. First of all, a thing like stasis is not devised to after-the-fact ad-hoc patching up blatant holes but because the observed fossil record appears to be more resembling a punctuated equilibria fashion of evolution than the purely gradual approach Darwin fancied. After some fierce debate this has settled down and now we have rather mixed model. Gradualism is observed in the fossil record. Very UNLIKE creationism that depends son unsupported assumptions and never observed ""things"" and clings to 3,500 old mythologies from the late Bronze Age, science is based on OBSERVATIONS. And when observations LEAD to the perception evolution isn't following a steady, gradual pace and directions but rather a more stop-and-go fashion, then minds will change.

So the GROSS distortion here is to call a few decades of palaeontological *observations* that led to this change of minds as ""story-telling"". Story-telling, boy is the creationist fashion. VERY old story telling.

In science observations rule.

439,"First of all you think that the task of biology and paleontology (other words for ""evolutionism"") is to reconstruct a kind of genealogical lineage from ancestral species A to descendant B. For instance you have a lobed-finned fish species ""A"" that turns into the first amphibian species ""B"". And you, ignorant layman, ""demand"" you want to see ALL intermediate species between A and B listed with their fossil evidence.

But this won't happen and is not done that way by paleontologists the last 300 years.

It's all in your fantasy but not in real life.

What paleontologists and biologists *actually* do is SCIENCE. For SCIENTIFIC purposes it greatly suffices to dig up intermediate fossils that demonstrate the transition in ***TRAITS*** between lobed-finned fish and amphibians.

As you have not a single clue what science is all about, here's an analogy: when the police tests an alibi by a suspect of a criminal case, for instance that the suspect indeed was in LA on a certain date but insists he was in NY that day, the investigators don't need to prove that the suspect passed all mile markers along the highway route from NY to LA that particular day. Only one pay stub from a tank station somewhere around Denver will do. Or the suspect's name on the passengers list of an airliner that day.

Secondly, paleontology is not about linking ancestors with descendants on the species level but mostly on much higher taxonomical ranks. Lobed-finned fish form a *class* with, extinct and extant, 21,000 species no less. Amphibians also form a complete *class* with a comparable number of extant and extinct species. YET we talk in paleontology about the transition from lobed-finned fish to amphibians.

Like the one pay stub or airliner passengers list, in paleontology we only need a FEW, well aimed transitional fossils to demonstrate the transition in ***TRAITS*** between lobed-finned fish and amphibians. We look for fossils that are demonstrably having fish traits *along with* amphibian traits. And we do. Not only Tiktaalik rosae but, in the meantime a whole range of fossils showing a clear and unequivocal transition of ***TRAITS*** between lobed0finned fish and amphibians.

442,"&gt; Because apoptosis would kill most ERV-containing cells, why is it that we still have so many ERVs hundreds of thousands of years after supposedly being inserted by retroviruses? (Also: is this assumption true?)

ERV containing cells are not killed by apoptosis. Normally apoptosis would happen when a cell is compromised (or too old or when its work is done and it's sitting in the way for further development of the organism) and in order to protect the organism against derailment or further damage, the cell disintegrates. But an ERV is a virus infection which was surmounted by the cell - it managed to fight back and won. In that case the retorvirus, now disabled, is no threat any more and no apoptosis needed.

&gt; Are there more cases of similar ERV’s between species that are thought to be related, besides of apes and humans?

ERVs are found throughout the whole animal kingdom. Humans share ERVs with all mammals.

&gt; Another problem for the evolutionary explanation is that very similar ERVs exist in unrelated animals [mentioned are bats and marsupials).

ALL organisms on earth are related. Both bats and marsupials you mention are mammals. There are only some ~5,500 mammals species. Each of these species are (much) more close to humans than *any* of the few million other, non-mammalian species. So calling bats and marsupials unrelated to humans is not true but even, actually, they are *very close* to humans.

Humans sharing ERVs with marsupials or bats is piece of cake and actually demonstrates that all mammals indeed have a common ancestor.

&gt; What proves that the ERV’s found in the related species are in fact injected by retroviruses? Basically I’m interested in your responses to this article: http://evolutiondismantled.com/ervs.

When creatures occupy the same ecological niche, they will develop similar characteristics. Chameleons have long, sticky tongues for capturing insects to eat. Guess who else has a long, sticky tongue for insect-eating? Giant anteaters. One is a reptile, one is a mammal, yet they both have the same adaptation that serves the same function in both species. How is this a hole in evolutionary theory again? That's right, it fucking isn't. Not only that but you didn't give enough of a fuck to provide your own example of a hole in evolution caused by convergence.

445,"&gt; You claim that proper science is based on the Methodological Naturalism Presupposition (and this also means that you do not claim to be a Philosophical Naturalist, else the BDMNP would be superfluous);

This is false, science is nor based on the useless and superfluous ""concept"" of BDMNP, naturalism is the consequence of the scientific method, which is based on the primacy of empirical observation.

&gt; Since the BDMNP superintends over your science,

It doesn't. If something ""superintends"" science, it's empirical observation.

&gt; your science only considers natural causes as candidates for the causes of natural phenomena, even though you cannot rule out supernatural causation.

Indeed we cannot a priori rule out supernatural causes but supernatural causes fall off the table automatically because they are, as the word supernatural says, not OBSERVABLE. It's just one of those things that rule out themselves because they do not meet the requirements of the scientific method. They leave the scene by own admission and as a *consequence* of scientific methodology, NOT as a premise.

&gt; Again, you cannot rule out supernatural agency; therefore you must be able to deal with the possibility of existential supernatural causation in our natural world.

Science requires observable phenomena. Supernatural agencies are not observable. SO OFF THEY GO.

&gt; therefore you must be able to deal with the possibility of existential supernatural causation in our natural world.

MUST WE? Must we also be able to deal with the [$%*&amp;(*PRZ] phenomena dwelling the 345the dimension?

&gt; So, let's assume for a moment that a supernatural agent did in fact kick-start (i.e., was the cause of) the first life. 

You can assume all day long but unless you have no observational evidence it's not only an assumption but also an unsubstantiated assumptions. 

Personally, I won't spoil my time on such hollow assumptions. There are SO MANY that *are* substantiated and observable. These are MUCH MORE interesting, MUCH MORE thrilling and MUCH MORE likely. Even when I put off my scientific glasses, unsubstantiated, unobservable phenomena are not of any interest to me. 

&gt; No amount of ""scientific"" evidence could ever convince you that life had a supernatural cause (even though it did), 

WHAT ""scientific"" evidence??????

&gt; To quote Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life: ""Do I paint the correct picture, or do I exaggerate?""

INDEED mr. Potter is your world.

You don't paint the correct picture.

The telltale sign is using a *direct* quote, rather than making an argument based on someone's data. So you get a lot of Grauer's ""if ENCODE is right, evolution is wrong,"" without actually engaging on the question of junk DNA. Just cite that single (very bad) ENCODE study, quote Grauer, claim victory. This will get a downvote from me. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;authority

Again, it's using the title as a proxy for an argument. For example, whenever Sanford comes up, Sal jumps in with ""well he's a respected geneticist, Ivy league school, cited by smithsonian"" without doing even a little bit to engage on the question at hand, i.e. the validity of ""genetic entropy"". That's a pure argument from authority. This will also earn a downvote. 

&amp;nbsp;

Both of these share in common that they involve using the object (quote or credentials) as a proxy for making a case. The test is whether the point stands in the absence of the quote/credentials; are you defending the concept of genetic entropy with data, or are you citing Sanfords credentials to avoid having to do so? If the argument can't stand without the quote/credentials, its a fallacious argument and shouldn't have been made. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;perspective

You can't assert without evidence that, for example, the Bible is a factually accurate historical document. So if you're argument is ""Well, that's from your perspective, but from mine...""

The perspective is what we're debating! You can't sneak that into the premise. Begging the question is a downvote. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;analogies

They have to accurately represent the thing they purport to, at least a little bit. For example, 747 in a junkyard? Omits selection.

For me, this one depends on the situation. 747 in a junkyard is a downvote because that's not contributing at all. It's just wasting everyone's time. Most others aren't. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;micro/macro

1. No clear definition of macro is ever provided, rending the claim (""no macroevolution"") unfalsifiable, inevitably leading to chasing goalposts around.

2. The claim is that ""A can happen, but B cannot,"" so it is therefore on the person making the claim to demonstrate ""B cannot happen."" This requires a clear definition of B, a clear delineation between A and B, and also demonstration of a mechanism that would prevent B. Never happens.

That being said, I don't downvote this one. It's worth discussing. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;kinds

Lacking a clear definition makes the claim (""no evolution between kinds"") unfalsifiable. But still worth discussing, no downvote. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;convergence

I would have far more patience for this argument if creationists would take the time to learn what they're talking about. As it is, I have yet to encounter such an argument that accurately represents the evidence that allows us to determine when something is homologous vs. convergence vs. HGT. It's always a strawman. 

If the presentation is particularly egregious, I'll downvote this, but mostly not. Ignorance vs. dishonesty, trying err on the side of being charitable. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Irreducible complexity, etc. 

IC is wrong no matter which way you look at it, and I have no patience for pretending otherwise (though I'm happy to explain why again, and again, and again...). It's not a ""challenge"" for evolution, at all. ""Specified complexity"" is another one, this time so ill-defined it's unfalsifiable. No downvotes, though; worth discussing.

And although he agreed with the premise that such dialogues were important, he ""respectfully declined"" without explanation any further meetings.

0,"&gt; Fodor's supporters say the problem is nobody understands their argument.

This is also exactly what proponents of natural selection say when you critize the theory so right back at them! 

What fodor and his supporters say is that most people misunderstood the argument when it was first presented (this is pretty obvious considering the amount of times Fodor had to correct people). There are 6 common mistakes/misunderstandings that people seem to jump to when reading his book - Fodor and Palmarini have replied and corrected all of them in their paper length response ""*Reply to our critics*"" 

All F&amp;PP are attacking is the theory of natural selection (they are not attacking biology or evolution). They are not saying that scientists cannot go out and do evolutionary biology, look at natural histories of ecologies, make predictions, etc. Specifically, they are challanging the explanatory power of natural selection. You seem to hold many misconceptions about their arguments/book (don't worry though, you are in good company).

&gt; Fodor has never produced an explanation for how NS operates then if he is right.

Obviously! He doesn't have to because he is saying that Natural selection is bogus! What you mean is that he doesn't explain how evolution will work without natural selection qua adaptionism. Two things (1) Actually he does present some preliminary ideas by making the (controversial claim) that evo-devo can be pulled apart and away from Darwinian synthesis. (2) He doesn't need to present an alternative. His book is a critical piece of philosophy of science showing why a specific theory has trouble with doing what it purports to do. It is a primarily negative argument. He is happy to wait for scientists to come up with an alternative. 

&gt; his original premise is wrong.

So are you claiming that Natural Selection does not require an account of ""selection for?"" This would be a tough sell considering you would have to go with an extensional explination and exstensionality cannot break coextensive traits! Like I said, mere ""selection"" won't do the job at all because if one trait is selected, so is the coextensive trait. There has to be ""selection for"" and so there needs to be an account given of this. 

In regards to the Spider issue. F&amp;PP won't disagree. They are saying that NS by itself will not be able to account for the phenotypic adaption in spiders for web building. They don't deny that natural selection plus natural history will explain it... but then the natural selection part isn't needed at all. It is impotent. ",1,1511546983,2017-11-24 13:09:43

Fodor's supporters say the problem is nobody understands their argument. 

Well first of all their argument involves arguing elements of evolutionary biology which is very well understood by Fodor's critics and even a college biology grad can spot his errors. So Fodor or his critics can't claim biologists misunderstood him here or that Fodor has it right when they demonstrate the various ways in which what he says can't be done, is by scientists and has been. Those are in the very articles I referenced.

Fodor has never produced an explanation for how NS operates then if he is right. Now seven years ago when he was selling his book he might have gotten away with it. Today, seven years later, it's pretty telling he will never have one because his original premise is wrong. So scientists have pretty much laid that one on his plate if he wants to keep arguing his position. Fodor and his supporters continue to say he doesn't have to. Well he doesn't have to, but scientists are saying more than that... they are saying, he can't because he is wrong. Seven years later and nobody is holding their breath.

Of course its the same one. It is valid, so which premise do you want to deny?

The most embarrasing thing about the whole fiasco surrounding Fodor and Piatelli-Palmarini's book was that so many grade-A philosophers couldn't grasp a simple modus tollens. Coyne, Kitcher, Block, Dennett, Blackburn, Rosenberg, Godfrey-smith, Sober, and Pigluicci all made complete fools of themselves in their rush to criticize F&amp;P. F&amp;PP replied to all of them (including the article you cite) correcting them on their mistakes. Half the objections made by these philosophers simply misunderstood the book. Blackburn for example thought F&amp;PP were making an epistemological objection. Godfrey-Smith, in his cringe-worthy reply, ended up reducing natural selection to a tautology! Kitcher and Block (in the article you link) think that F&amp;PP claim that there is no fact of the matter in regards to what coexstensive trait causes fitness! This is absolutely halarious considering that F&amp;PP's argument depends on their being a fact of the matter! If there was no fact of the matter, then F&amp;PP's argument would have no force! 

Like I said, I am yet to see anyone actually take on F&amp;PP's intensionality argument. At least Noam Chomsky understood the main points of the book (surprise surprise, he gave the book a favourable review).

8,"The article you sight is terrible. Massimo Pigliucci has written two useless reviews of F&amp;PP's book (his other review is even worse tripe). Further, Pigliucci got his ass kicked by Fodor in a debate on the subject. Pigliucci hardly addresses the fact that NS must be read intensionally (with an 's' not 't') and that this must require nomological laws (the only other explination on offer for intensional causation requires a mind...and obviously we don't want that). The best the article does at trying to rebuke F&amp;PP's argument is to say that ""Here the authors ignore the entire field of evolutionary ecology, countless examples of convergent evolution of similar structures in different lineages that show the historical predictability of evolutionary processes, and the literature on experimental evolution, in which similar conditions consistently yield similar outcomes. There is clearly a logic to evolution.""

(1) F&amp;PP don't ""ignore"" these fields. They are both aware of these respective fields. (2) Their point is that these fields simply do not require NS as an explanatory apparratus (which is what NS is suppose to be). For example, they don't deny the historical predictability of evolutionary processes. What they are saying is that these fields and the discoveries and predictions in them are not dependent on natural selection (they are post-hoc). In other words, all biologists are doing is good old natural history of ecologies. Their claim is that NS is impotent as an explanatory hypothesis without an account of ""selects for.""

In the 8 years since F&amp;PP published their book nobody has shown where they go wrong in their argument (probably because they don't). Most folks simply reply with a misunderstood conception of F&amp;PP's argument, appeals to authority, or bluster about how great biology is (F&amp;PP don't deny the biology is great) and how unlikely it is that so many biologists could be wrong. The ""circling of the wagons"" surrouding the book is laughable. 

In regards to the empirical import of mathematical models you need to be careful that you don't assume that they stand and fall together. The truth of any mathematical model is going to be independent of its empirical import. 

No one is denying that scientific theories can be quantified physically. Of course you will get a physical explination (everything is physical). The problem is that you cannot quantify it biologically (no one wants to revert to the old idea that biology = physics plus labels). Furthermore, Statistical answers are great but they are also post-hoc and cannot always distinguish between causation and correlation (hence the intensionality problem).

Fisher's principle can be used to predict and model sex ratio's. Again no one is denying that. But the principle can stand regardless of the truth of natural selection (or selection pressures). Further, the principle itself relies on assuming certain emprical facts about the ecologies and the species involved.

I have yet to see anyone actually take on F&amp;PP's argument premise by premise or other a third explination of intensional causation.           ",1,1511469073,2017-11-23 15:31:13

https://www.nature.com/articles/464353a

Scientists have never said mathematics is empirical. Who would? The Greeks discovered irrational numbers in ancient times. Mathematics is a tool (language combined with logic) used by the experimental method as they would any instruments of measure. The axioms are quantified. When scientists say you have two eyes in your head after an MRI scan, those two eyes are a quantification that can expressed in terms of mass, substance, and composition at the biochemical level.

I think therefore you have some misconception between mathematics and models used to quantify systems and the scientific method which uses these tools but it empirical. Everything can quantified physically. Hence why you think a proposition like Fisher's or even something like the Hardy–Weinberg principle, also known as the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium are just models/theorems from which can be derived the tools needed to measure and calculate for quantification used in the scientific method.",1,1511459710,2017-11-23 12:55:10
13,"&gt; How do you arrive at it without selection pressures that reduce gene frequencies for the preferential parental care of one sex over another?

Firstly Fisher's principle (if it is going to work for adaptionist purposes) assumes the emprical conjecture that in a given speicies there is an inherited disposition to produce more male or more female births (This is not confirmed for a large amount of species and certainly wasn't confirmed when Fisher published). Further, if we just assume that sex alocation is completely random, then the 1:1 ratio can be explained. Even if the male population was drastically reduced in one generation, by the next the ratio can be restored to 1:1 simply by assuming that sex allocation is random. There is no selection pressures here. A similar story can be told to explain the asymmetry between male and female births when rearing a son is more costly (just assume equal probability of male and female births). 

There is a second problem in regards to mathematical models and natural selection. Mathematical models are *a priori* but natural selection is supposed to be an empirical (*a posteriori*) theory/hypothesis. What this means is that the mathematical models can be generated independently of natural selection and don't actually contribute anything to it, nor will they follow from it.  

&gt; When a biologist says selection ""for,"" what they mean is that when you have three conditions together (struggle for survival, genetic variation, and reproduction) that natural selection must occur. There is a selection OF (not for)

Alrighty there are some misconceptions here. (1) We arn't interested in what biologists say, we are interested in what the theory of natural selection says. (2) Natural selection must be read as ""selects for"" otherwise it could not distinguish between coextensive traits when only one is a cause of fitness and the other is a hitchhiker. This is because both traits will be selected (or selected of). But the theory requires that one of the traits is selected for (because of) being a cause of fitness. This is the difference between extensional and intensional explinations. Only intensional explinations can break coexstensive traits. 

Simple Example: The heart both pumps blood and makes thump-thump noises. These traits are coexstensive meaning that they co-vary (you get both or non - similar to a biconditional relation). Natural selection cannot be saying that the blood pumping is *selected/selected of* (this should be obvious because if the blood pumping is selected, then so is the thump-thump noise). Natural selection presuposes that the pumping blood is *selected for* and the thump-thump noise is a free-rider (merely *selected*). So natural selection needs to give an account of selection-for. But unfortunately for natural selection the only intensional causal explinations available appeal to either mental predicates/minds (and this option is ruled out because there is no Gardner in nature), or nomological laws (this option is ruled out because there are no nomological laws at the biological level). So natural selection cannot do what it purports to be doing - that is, be an explination of phenotypic trait fixation accross species and ecologies. Essentially it is going to reduce to a trivial observation: ""if a creature flourishes/survives in a given ecology, then there must be something in virtue of which it does.""

There actually was for a few decades after Darwin published On the Origin of Species because mutationists had thought they found the source of variation that could also be responsible for complexity. This turned out to be false. It was insufficient.

Mendel at the time of Darwin, had read Darwin and already published the laws of genetic inheritance with his pea experiments in German but Darwin never read it. 

Scientists began to understand that mutations alone can't be responsible for biological complexity around which time experiments on fruit flies by Morgan turned up Mendel's own results from decades back. 

Darwin's natural selection is simply 3 things. Reproduction, variation and the struggle for survival. When Mendel's genetic laws were inserted in the 'variation' part of natural selection it also incorporated mutations which satisfied part of the mutationist argument but was obviously incomplete. Darwin's natural selection was correct all along, they just needed the key to variation which turned out to be segregated inheritance and not blending. Fisher then mathematically quantified natural selection and demonstrated it was the only mechanism by which organic complexity can come about under these conditions. Modern synthesis was born.

That period when mutationism was most popular would never have been if Mendel was discovered before that.",1,1511375462,2017-11-22 13:31:02

Natural Selection remained in the backdrop after Darwin discovered it as the study of mutations overwhelmed it. Eventually when mutations were studied more and Darwin's quest for variation linked with Mendel's laws of hereditary his natural selection was completed by the addition of genetic laws explaining variation. Fisher the statistician quantified natural selection mathmatically and scientists in all the major fields of biology where able to use Darwin's natural selection to develop the *modern evolutionary synthesis* which was complete by the 30s. Basically they applied natural selection and genetics to biology and where able to explain the whole of biology with this unifing concept.

Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture really kicked off around 10,000 BCE have ranged between 1 million and 15 million. Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BCE. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century CE. We know because the Romans were the first to hold censuses. In the 14th century the world population dropped at least 25% due to the Plague. We know that it took 200 years for the world population figures to recover. *Before*, in the 6th to the 8th century the Plague of Justinian (named after the Roman emperor) took 50% of the European population, we know this by the Roman censuses and the amny historical attests. Starting in 2 AD, the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household. In the year 2 AD the population of Western Han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households, decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by 146 AD, towards the End of the Han Dynasty.

48,"Hey, /u/nomenmeum, your websites are *lying* again.

Let's reveal the distortions and lies.

&gt; From the very beginning, the cranium has been the center of controversy among evolutionists. 

Translation: ""From the very beginning, like most fossil finds of new species, ~~evolutionists~~ scientist (paleontologists) need to figure out how to interpret it correctly, which sometomes may take a decade or two including affirming by second finds.""

&gt; Second, if “Toumaï” is a hominid, it would disqualify many famous fossils that are not nearly as old and whose discoverers have claimed their human ancestry. 

It does *not* disqualify any other famous hominid fossil. This is as stupid as saying that chimpanzees still living today disqualifies the evolutionary history of humans. This is nothing less than a variant of the ""if humans come from apes why are there still apes?"" canard.

&gt; Furthermore, if “Toumaï” is a hominid, the inferred age of “Toumaï” would place the beginning of the human evolutionary line much earlier than molecular studies have allegedly indicated. In other words, the molecular data do not conform to the fossil data.

This is incorrect, it should be: ""... would place the beginning of the human evolutionary line much earlier than *some* molecular studies have allegedly indicated.""

Molecular studies are inaccurate and are only used as an indication of the age of evolutionary events, when other evidence is lacking. Moreover, many molecular studies indicate a split between chimpanzees and humans up to 12 million years ago. 

&gt; The press hailed it as the true “missing link.” It was featured on the front cover of Nature, perhaps the most respected science journal in the world, on July 11, 2002. 

This intricately composition of statements suggests that Nature was hailing the new hominid as ""missing link"". It was not. What the pop-science journals write is not relevant. Those live of magnified hypes. Also AiG has not the slightest clue about what ""missing link"" *actually means in paleontology. And I can tell by this quote:

&gt; Last is the question of whether or not “Toumaï” was bipedal, which is one of the major qualifications for being a hominid. 

Missing link are also those species that still dwell on the pithecus (""apes"") line. 

&gt; On October 10, 2002, an international team headed by Milford Wolpoff (University of Michigan) wrote a letter to Nature challenging the fact that “Toumaï” was a hominid. They claimed that the features in the teeth, face and skull used by Burnet in calling “Toumaï” a hominid are not unique to hominids but can be found in apes as well. They suggested that “Toumaï” might be an ancestral female gorilla (Ann Gibbons, The First Human, Doubleday, 2006, p. 218). The controversy continues to this day.

Yes that's what I like about science. No doctrine but vivid discussion and debate where the observations decide. In the mean time, when Toumaï indeed was found to be a proto gorilla, the disparity between the molecular and fossil data all of a sudden are solved, isn't it? Of course they didn't mention THAT. Secondly, thus quarrel about the actual status of a fossil is very common in paleontology. It's it *hallmark*. Transitional fossils are fossils that by their very transitional nature are ambiguous and difficult to determine. This ambiguity is exactly to be expected when evolution is true.

&gt; That controversies like this arise is not surprising. 

INDEED. They are the hallmark of evolution.

&gt; Since evolutionists believe that humans evolved from an ape-like stock, it is not surprising that they should consider ape-like fossils as possible human ancestors. 

Wow! INDEED!

&gt; Evolutionists claim: “During the Miocene epoch [from 5.5 to 22 million years ago] as many as 100 species of apes roamed throughout the Old World” (“Becoming Human,” Scientific American special, 16:2, 2006, p. 5). Yet, evolutionists claim that virtually no ape fossils have been found. 

This is a distortion and thus a lie. ~~Evolutionists~~ paleontologists have found *many* homonoid fossils. The fossils that are not easy to find are only those of chimpanzees and gorillas.

&gt; Creationists suspect that many fossils of extinct ape species have been found but that they are misinterpreted as human evolutionary ancestors. 

Really? WHERE is the paleontological evidence. This is implicitly accusing paleontologists to deliver bungle. and that accusation comes from habitual liars and anti-scientific liars and deceivers. Sometime the stink of creationism is unbearable.

&gt; It is my belief, after study in this field for forty years, that all of the hominid fossils below the level of Homo erectus (which is fully human) are nothing but extinct primates that have been arranged in a sequence to attempt to prove that humans have evolved.

WHERE is the FUCKING evidence?

49,"Happy to. 

The gist of the argument the authors make is this:

Between 1918 and 2009, the strain of H1N1 influenza circulating in humans accumulated a bunch of mutations; it changed a lot. Over that time, it became less pathogenic; fewer people died from it over time. They also measured the codon bias (how some synonymous codons were used more or less frequently than others) became more different from human codon bias over this time. They concluded that this virus experienced error catastrophe, a constant decrease in fitness due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, ultimately leading to its extinction. 

There is SO much wrong here, so get comfy. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, the measures they use as proxies for fitness are mortality rates and codon bias match to the host. Neither of these is a valid measure of viral fitness.

In the case of mortality, viruses that are more deadly are often *lower* fitness (i.e. have lower reproductive success; spread less rapidly) than less deadly variants. This is due to a phenomenon called the competition-dispersal tradeoff. Basically, if you are good at competing with other viruses *within* a single host, you are going to predominate in the intra-host population, but at the expense of higher morbidity and mortality, which means fewer opportunities to spread to a new host. But if you're less deadly, you might not be *the* best within your host, but you are more likely to spread to other hosts. So over the long term, lower mortality can actually be indicative of natural selection driving *increased* fitness, contra what the authors argue. 

Also relevant: The most common cause of death associated with severe flu cases is pneumonia. Starting in the mid-40s, that became much less deadly due to the introduction of antibiotics. You'd think that'd be worth mentioning if we're using a decreasing mortality rate to argue about something completely unrelated to antibiotics, but I guess the authors disagree. 

For codon bias, the argument is much simpler: Selection for codon biases that match your host are extremely weak, and RNA viruses mutate so fast that selection for a specific codon usage profile cannot keep up. This leads to RNA viruses having codon bias that is effectively random with regard to the codon bias of their hosts. Influenza is an RNA virus, so we have no reason to expect anything other than approximately random codon preferences, and we have no reason to associate its codon bias with fitness; they are basically uncorrelated. 

So right off the bat, the metrics the authors used to evaluate viral fitness are completely invalid. On those grounds alone, their argument that H1N1 experienced error catastrophe is undone. 

&amp;nbsp;

But wait! There's more!

They argue that this strain of influenza *went extinct*. You may be surprised to learn that this statement is...complete hogwash? Let's go with complete hogwash.

Every year, we talk about ""this year's flu,"" as though there's one single strain. But the reality is that there are several to dozens of strains circulating simultaneously all the time (even when it's not flu season!). The most common ones get all the attention each year, but they aren't the only game in town. 

What happens is that every so often, a different strain spikes in frequency, and all the competing strains become very rare. But they don't go extinct. They just circulate at much lower levels. 

&lt;More complicated evolutionary explanation follows, feel free to skip&gt;

Going back to what I said earlier, about how selection can favor transmission to new hosts rather than competition within a single individual host, that dynamic makes a common strain vulnerable to a new, more virulent (deadlier) strain. If a strain, over many years, becomes relatively low-mortality, but a new, very dangerous strain appears, they will compete. When I host is infected with both, which wins? The new, deadly strain, since the older strain has adapted to minimize damage to the host, which means it doesn't compete well within individual hosts. So the evolutionary dynamics lead to this cyclical pattern of new strain --&gt; adapt to host --&gt; become vulnerable to challenger --&gt; new strain emerges --&gt; repeat. 

&lt;End of more complicated explanation&gt;

But all that aside, even *if* a strain went extinct in humans (which only very rarely happens), they even less frequently go extinct entirely, since influenza can also infect birds and pigs. Different strains are constantly bouncing around between the three types of hosts, and the absence of a strain from one of them doesn't indicate its global extinction. 

So on the *outcome* that the authors use to make their case, that the 1918 H1N1 eventually went extinct, they are also wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

So to review, the authors claim the 1918 H1N1 decreased in fitness over the twentieth century and eventually went extinct due to error catastrophe. None of that statement is true: It did not decrease in fitness (at least not by the measures the authors used), and it did not go extinct. So they were *completely* wrong about *everything* in this study. 

&amp;nbsp;

But one more fun fact: Sanford fraudently manipulates someone else's data to make the point about the H1N1 fitness decline. Read about it [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPW6H4PXYFMTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0981631606) by searching for ""hardly believe my eyes"" and reading the next few paragraphs.

51,"The only ""descent from Darwin"" that I know of is the title of a rather lackluster statement titled [A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scientific_Dissent_from_Darwinism), made by the intelligent design (read: creationist) think-tank called the Discovery Institute in the early 2000s.

Long story short: over eight years or so they got some seven-hundred people to sign a statement that read:

&gt;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.

Now, right off the bat you'll notice that this statement has extremely weak phrasing, encouraging ""careful examination"" at worst.  Were you to look at _who_ was signing the statement, you'd also notice that only about a quarter of signers had an expertise in fields relevant to evolution.  And of course, just by looking at it you can see that it's a pitifully small number of signers even without considering expertise relevance - perhaps a fiftieth of a percent of scientists worldwide, give or take a hundredth.

The wiki article goes into more detail about its criticisms, but I think the most distinct counter is the parody counter-petition called [Project Steve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Steve).  Project Steve is a similar effort to get signatures behind a statement, but you'll notice the statement is much firmer:

&gt;Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to ""intelligent design,"" to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.

Beyond that, we get to the amusing bits: for this statement, they only allowed scientists who had the given name ""Steve"" or some variation thereon (Esteban, Stephanie, etc.), to sign.  At the time, ""Steves"" amounted to perhaps one percent of the population (in the US), so already this restricts the potential signers to rather less than a hundredth of those that could sign the DI's above statement.

You have to understand that modern evolutionary theory is not Darwin's evolutionary theory. 

A lot has been learned since the 1860s. Darwin knew nothing about DNA and nothing about genetics. As a result his theory of inheritance was completely wrong, and you cannot have a viable theory of evolution with a proper understanding of inheritance. 

So modern evolutionary theory is most definitely not Darwin's evolutionary theory. 

The period between the two wars is when the foundations of population genetics (which is the core of evolutionary theory) were laid. Perhaps your teacher is referring to those events?

Even then though, the interpretations of the theoretical results derived at the time were not entirely correct, because people still did not know the structure of DNA, and it was only once that was deciphered and the genetic code was understood well that one could fully realize how important neutral evolution is for the overall process. So there was another major revision of the theory in the 1960s and 1970s.

Make sure he understand what the Theory of Evolution (ToE) actually says, so that you are debating an actual theory, not one he made up. He doesn't. Once you explain it, you will find that he agrees with most of it. For example, when he says ""variation,"" he probably means the actual ToE, while he is arguing against an imaginary one.

Ask him his explanation for the proliferation of species on earth. Specifically. Either his doesn't have one, or he has one that doesn't work. You will really have to press him on this, because he will continue to answer, ""God,"" forgetting that you have already agreed on that, and are now asking how, not who. If pressed or inexperienced, he may eventually say something I call Magical Poofing.

Pin him down on whether he thinks science works. He will say yes, and later, when you make it clear that science supports ToE, he will take it back.

If pressed, he will start talking about something called a ""kind."" He has no idea what that means, and neither does anyone else, because it is a madeup word that YECs use elastically to fill in holes in their ideas.",1,1511036155,2017-11-18 15:15:55
78,"&gt; ""ERV"" is an endogenous retrovirus, basically a viral gene complex that got absorbed into the genome, right?

Indeed it is an endogenous retrovirus, a virus that entered the genome. 

Viruses are organisms that do not have a reproductive system of their own. They must hijack a host cell to make *those* reproducing the virus. Viruses are parasites. And of course doing so they ruin or disorganize the host cell. That's why viral infections cause disease.

Mostly viruses enter the host cell and start to hijack the cellular mechanisms. Retroviruses are different in the sense that they directly nestle themselves in the host cell's DNA.

Often cells manage to surmount a viral attack. When a retrovirus infection is surmounted, its DNA leaves behind in the cell's DNA, disabled. When such a host cell happens to be germ cells (sperm or egg), the DNA of the surmounted retrovirus may be passed to the next generation and over many generations become dominant in the species' genome.

In that way it indeed became absorbed into the species' genome.

&gt; I'm not sure what a ""transposable element"" is.

Sometimes chunks of DNA are copied and inserted somewhere else in the DNA randomly, thus the DNA ends up riddled with many of those copies. Chunks of DNA copied and inserted somewhere else is just basically what ""transposable element"" (or often just shortly ""transposons"") means. This may be caused by mutations but often those chunks themselves have DNA sequences that trigger this easily.

ERVs are such transposons that copy themselves greedily and move around. Partly because retroviruses like to be let copied greedily - after all that's what they're after when infecting a host cell.

Feel free to ask more until you've got the feeling you grasp it, because ERVs are an important piece of evidence for evolution.

Because it's hard? Because evolution is complex? 

The point of models is to demonstrate a specific thing. Take Kimura's work. He developed a number of models that demonstrate the importance of drift. He didn't then argue ""there drift is the only thing driving evolutionary change."" He just showed that under certain conditions, drift can predominate over selection, even over the long term. Creationists, it seems, take similarly limited models, but draw from them unreasonably broad conclusions.

&gt; No, they are harmful because the resulting phenotype carries a fitness cost in the present environment.

Yes, and what is the underlying cause of that reduced fitness?  It almost always traces back to a degraded or disabled gene, just like I said.

Behe and Snoke's 2004 paper was indeed about a very limited case.  Without modelling many other possible cases I agree that we can't draw broader conclusions about evolution from it.  Mendel on the other hand is modeling all the parameters that are most likely to affect outcomes, while simplifying other parameters (usually in favor of evolution) and ignoring rare phenomenon and processes unlikely to make much difference on the outcome.

""If evolution is"" such a workable model, ""why can't anyone on your side"" produce a population genetics simulation with realistic parameters that does anything other than lead to mutational meltdown?

to lethal mutagenesis of the viral genetic material. In the

genome viability (Fig. 2B, Table 2), which can fully account for
the 3.2-fold inhibition of infectious poliovirus titer (Table 2). In
the presence of 400 mM ribavirin, there was an 18-fold reduction
in genome viability (Fig. 2B, Table 2). Additionally, there was a
6-fold reduction in total genomic RNA (Fig. 2A, Table 2), which
was likely due to the inactivation of many replicating viral
genomes in the ribavirin-treated cells during the multiple rounds
of replication and mutagenesis occurring in a single infectious
cycle. The combined effects of the mutagen on loss in genome
viability (18-fold) and reduction in genomic RNA production
(6-fold) would result in an anticipated total reduction in infectious
virus titer of ~100-fold, which indeed accounts for the full

2.  Sanford et al submitted the paper to World Scientific.
3.  World Scientific found other scientists to review Sanford's paper and make sure it was of good quality.

From their [policy](http://www.worldscientific.com/page/authors/peer-review-policy): ""To maintain a high-quality publication, all submissions undergo a rigorous review process""

96,"&gt; See what you did here? Only making the argument that favor your side, without mentioning the obvious opposite case? Do you realize you do this? If the originally-beneficial mutations can become harmful, what about the much larger number of originally-harmful mutations?

The opposite case also works against you.  Any time a mutation can be both beneficial or harmful it makes it harder for selection to act upon it.  The  optimal case for evolution is if beneficial mutations are always beneficial and deleterious mutations are always deleterious, and that is what Mendel models.

Let's go through your other issues:

1.  epistasis -  Mendel does support epistasis but most of the published work has it turned off because epistasis is rare.
2.  neutral mutations - They have no effect apart from the rare cases when they become beneficial or hamful, but modeling those cases would work against you per the next point:
3.  dynamic fitness effects - Again, almost all harmful mutations are harmful because they degrade or disable the function of a gene.  In some cases it can be beneficial to disable a gene, thus we get the dynamic fitness effects, but the end result is a net decrease in the amount of information in a genome.  If Mendel also modeled selection for the destruction of genes, that would also work against your case because then gene loss would be accelerated.

The irony here is that the last time I discussed Mendel in depth with a group of skeptics, they didn't like it because it was too complex and modeled too many phenomenon, making it more difficult for them to work out what it was doing.

I also don't see the point in this.  Do you think that if one in 10,000 mutations that's harmful becomes beneficial, or or neutral or vice versa, that it would have any significant effect on Mendel's output?

I think you misunderstand the purpose of Mendel.  It doesn't model nor is it meant to model how beneficial and deleterious mutations occur at the molecular level.  So e.g. with gene duplications, Mendel assumes that beneficial mutations occur without first requiring a gene duplication in order to ahve it work.  Again, doing that with populations in the tens of thousands would require supercomputers with terrabytes of ram, instead of having a simulation that we can all run and duplicate on our home computers.

Mendel merely assumes that deleterious and beneficial mutations *DO* occur at whatever rate you program in, and then it tracks how they are acted upon by selection.  For that it is the most biologically realistic simulation of its kind.  And it inevitably shows fitness declining every generation, using any biologically plausible parameters.

- lungs and, consequently, nostrils. Tiktaalik also still had gills. Having both lungs and gills are *exactly* one would expect to find in transitional fossils.

It also had features that are partly fish-like but also partly tetrapodal:

- half-fish, half-tetrapod limb bones and joints, including a functional wrist joint and radiating, fish-like fins instead of toes
- half-fish, half-tetrapod ear region.

Want nice pictures? Here is a [nice one](https://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/17/30/76/23/f1_lar10.jpg). Look at the sequence in part A. From the left to the right you see the fore-limbs of: 

1. Chondrichthyans (class of fish that have cartilage skeletons, examples are sharks and rays and the like). 

2. Polydon (an example of the ray-finned fish like paddlefish and sturgeons).

3. Danio (a class of fresh water fish like carps, barbs etc.). 

4. Suaripterus is a true, extinct lobe-finned fish of the order of rhizodonts.

5. Tiktaalik.

6. Acanthostega (one of the earliest tetrapods with clear limbs, yet it lacked wrists and it had 8 digits in a webbed fashion). 

&gt; None of the lobe-fin fish in existence, including Tiktaalik, have bones attaching their fins to the axial skeleton. The bones attached are extremely delicate. Therefore it is believed that the fins on the Tiktaalik are not used to carry weight, and subsequently not for walking.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLh4ODMBGJE) (Mudskipper), here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZdavNHGUho) and here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUk8JzGwBHo) are examples of *extant* fish that walk the land on a regular basis. *none* of these fish have their fins attached to their axial skeletons. Yet they walk.

&gt; The bones attached are extremely delicate.

The limb bones of Tiktaalik were *not* delicate, they were bony, robust and sturdy. As the picture above clearly shows.

Even if Tiktaalik did not crawl the land, it *still* is a perfect transitional species because as a fish, it had clear features that are unique to the later tetrapods. But Tiktaalik DID crawl the land beyond any reasonable doubt. There is *a reason* for such an animal to have lungs, sturdy, robust ribs and limbs. Robust ribs indicate the animal did roam the land because such ribs are to make breathing through lungs possible when the animal is out of water and thus experience the downwards pressure of gravitation. A robust pelvis and bony limbs indicate there was weight to be transplanted.

Which again, is what evolution predicts.

Macro evolution is a result of gradual changes over many generations somwhat similar to how you slowly went from a clump of cells to a tasty shrimp looking thing called an embryo and eventually into an adult human in the course of your single lifetime.

114,"I am ABIDING your answers on my post about the fossil evidence.

Pertaining this post: A LOT in it wrong again.

Humans do have [notochords during embryonic development](https://d2gne97vdumgn3.cloudfront.net/api/file/8nQtkl4zSXmlMWVqgPrS). The notochord leaves vestiges in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs up and are finally replaced by chondrocyte-like cells not earlier than at 4 years of age.

Humans develop post-anal tails during the first weeks of embryonic gestation. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has [10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, accounting for more than 10% of the length of the embryo](https://syllabus.med.unc.edu/courseware/embryo_images/unit-genital/genital_htms/genital020.htm). The embryonic tail is composed of several complex tissues besides the developing vertebrae, including a secondary neural tube (spinal cord), a notochord, mesenchyme, and tail gut. Exactly the tissues found in any vertebrate tail. By the eighth week of gestation, the sixth to twelfth vertebrae have disappeared via cell death, and the fifth and fourth tail vertebrae are still being reduced. Likewise, the associated tail tissues also undergo cell death and regress. 

[EVERY chordate embryo develops pharyngeal slits](http://www.evolutionevidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/378px-Stage14_sem2l.jpg) (alternatively names ""pharyngeal pouches""). You were not an exception when you still were an embryo.

And every human embryos starts to develop a the dorsal hollow nerve cord and you should be happy it also was happening with you as an embryo because later these became your brain and spinal cord.

&gt; Cladistics is only organization of taxonomies based on the interpretation that evolution is a real process. It’s simply interpretation of fossils through one’s own beliefs.

You have not a single clue about how science works. It goes like this:

1. you stop staring all day in old mythology books, you slam shut them and start *to look around what really happens"" and let the phenomena talk *for themselves*.

2. in this way you do observations. For instance you observe the fossil record and notice what you see.

3. you formulate an hypothesis to explain what you see. For instance, ""the way life is taxonomically organized is in clades"". Hypotheses in science are always formulated in a vulnerable way. For instance you define ""clade"" in a way that it maximal prone to empirical falsification.

4. you test the hypothesis by providing evidence for it by further observations.

5a. when the observations contradict your hypothesis, you reject it - or you adjust it until it meets the observation.

5b. when the observations affirm your hypothesis *and* when there are no other, alternative hypotheses that  explain and cover the observed facts better, you may consider it to be the best explanation for the phenomena studied. In science this is called ""theory"". Theory in science is the best explanation for the observed facts. Yes, i know, almost diametrically opposing the meaning of (""just a"") ""theory"" in colloquial language. Can't help but science was first adapting the word from Greek and coined it.

""Clades"" have gradually displaced the old taxa we inherited from Linaeus last decades. The reason for that is because the old taxa left a lot of contradictions, hiatuses and lose ends when trying to classify life into a comprehensible system. When they started to introduce clades, it immensely made more sense and many conflicts, contradictions, hiatuses and lose ends went away.

In other words, clades are a better concept to look at the observed (past and present) biodiversity than other classification principles. In other words, cladistics is the hypothesis about the diversification of life that meets the observed facts best.

It is not an assumption, it is the direct result of *EXTREMELY* large bodies of observations.

&gt; I state again, that in order for the cladistics breakdown you provided to work, you must first provide evidence of how organisms could evolve into taxonomically new/unique animals.

This is TOTALLY wrong as well. Cladistics is a way to *classify* the observed biodiversity. It has even NOTHING to do with how organisms evolve. You really have no idea what you are tattling about.

116,"&gt; I don’t disagree that the examples you gave me were examples of speciation.

Great! That was what you requested as examples of macroevolution. Speciation. Here's what you said:

&gt;It seems that in order to “prove” punctuated equilibrium, you must first “prove” or provide clear conclusive evidence of speciation.

Seems open and shut. But now that isn't the standard? Because that post was...yesterday. 

But now you want this:

&gt;You see, there is no evidence which shows that speciation leads to new “kinds” of organisms. Speciation has never been observed to get to the level of mass change, like cat to dog.

And here you are again moving the goal posts:

&gt;See this is the problem with evolutionists. They don’t understand that what they are describing is not macroevolution.

&gt;Evolutionists see adaptation and variation, but scream macroevolution.

&gt;First I need you to define what a species is.

&gt;You stated that reproductive isolation leads to one species splitting into two. THAT IS NOT MACROEVOLUTION.

And finally:

&gt;I asked for an example of speciation which has led to a new “kind” of organism.

&amp;nbsp;

This is too easy, but okay, I'll play along.

Define ""kind"". What would count, for you, according to your super special unique definition of evolution?

Would an amoeboid rhizarian turning into green algae count?

Would an animal becoming photosynthetic count?

Would a unicellular organism becoming multicellular count?

Would a plasmid evolving into a virus count?

Would a different plasmid evolving into a completely novel biological entity count?

The pouches in human embryos are homologous to the slits that form into gills in fish and amphibian embryos. Same structures, different appearance. We have them.

The tail is actually a tail, not just the spinal column outpacing the rest of the body. Cells in that region die via apoptosis later in development. It's actually a tail that goes away.

118,"&gt;Nobody assumes. We conclude based on evidence. Saying it that way is either a deliberate misrepresentation or a sign of profound ignorance of how science works.

You assume the organisms that you provided are transitional forms which show a direct “missing link” between organisms. However, this is simply done by your interpretation through your worldview of the supposed “evidence” you state you have, although with all of the organisms you have provided, I have refuted and showed why they are not any form of “missing link.” 

&gt;Only adaptation"" tells me you either don't understand how evolution works, or don't care. They adapted to different niches and became reproductively isolated. That's speciation, full stop. Did you not know that or do you not care?

Of course, I don’t disagree that the examples you gave me were examples of speciation. I do not deny that species vary, change, and even appear over time. The biodiversity represented in the 8.7 million or so species in the world is a testament, not to random chance processes, but to the genetic variability and potential for diversification within the created “kinds.” In no way am I denying speciation. However, I am denying that speciation can create organisms outside of the taxonomic level of families.

You see, there is no evidence which shows that speciation leads to new “kinds” of organisms. Speciation has never been observed to get to the level of mass change, like cat to dog. Speciation only leads to varied species that are still classified in the same taxa as it’s predecessor. For example, wolfs and dogs are great examples of speciation. Both diverged, but were still the same “kind” of animal. They can still reproduce with eachother, and will always birth their “kind.” That in no way is macroevolution. Never has and never will speciation lead to an organism that can’t reproduce with other animals in its family. Ever. Dog will birth dog, cat will birth cat, snake will birth snake, lizard will birth lizard. 

Do you understand this? 

&gt;I gave you *specific* examples of that exact thing. Reproductive isolation; one species splitting into two. Do you not realize that, or are you lying? And do you not know that we've done it [in the lab,](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_45) too (see the bottom section there)?

See this is the problem with evolutionists. They don’t understand that what they are describing is not macroevolution. 

*Evolutionists see adaptation and variation, but scream macroevolution.*

First I need you to define what a species is. 

You stated that reproductive isolation leads to one species splitting into two. THAT IS NOT MACROEVOLUTION. When two species split, they are still the same “kind” of animals. A finch may develop into a swallow, but guess what? They are still birds. That is only variation amongst taxa. 

Please, please, please, understand that in order for something to be an example of macroevolution, a change in “kinds” must occur. This means a finch must evolve into an organism that can’t reproduce with other birds; think dinosaur to bird evolution. You see, this large of a change has NEVER been observed nor has any evidence whatsoever supporting it. 

&gt;You defined macroevolution as speciation, but here speciation isn't good enough. Moving the goalposts within a single post.

Incorrect. I was never asked about my definition of speciation. Speciation is real and does occur. But speciation which leads to macroevolution (or change from one “kind” to another “kind”) isn’t. 

&gt;This is different from what you asked for. You requested speciation. Now you ask for more.

I would gladly be able to address each and every supposed “trait” during embryonic development if you would like, as there are MULTIPLE problems, like for example pharyngeal slits. In no way shape or form have humans EVER had gill slits. The slits that you claim humans have during development? They are simply folds in the region of an embryos throat. By the 28th day of life, the embryo’s brain and spinal cord seem to be widely ahead of the rest of the body in growth. Therefore, for a time, the spinal cord is actually longer than the body, forcing the body to curl and subsequently, for lack of better words, “flexing” the neck area forward. This curled embryo with the long spinal cord is mistakenly accused by some people of having a tail or as you may state as having a “post-anal tail.” ",1,1510945593,2017-11-17 14:06:33

Some of them take it further and suggest that the reason that they resemble viral sequences and can be ""resurrected"" into viruses isn't that ERVs came from virsus, but viruses came from ERVs!

They suggest that ERV sequences were created in the genomes of various kinds, and because of the fall these sequences ""escaped"" the genome (insert miracle here) and became the viruses we see around us today. 

One of the most basic reasons that they're wrong is the fact that many ERVs are intact enough to retain signatures of *insertion* rather than just having been created in a genome originally: flanking target site duplications and identical LTRs.",1,1510924715,2017-11-17 08:18:35
125,"I think [GuyInAChair](/u/GuyInAChair) addressed well the first argument, so up to the second on.

One of the ERVs that became functional is the one that let the very early embryo permeate the uterus as a preparation to form the  umbilical (navel) cord. Another one suppresses the immune system of the mother to prevent it attacking the embryo. How do we know these were former, endogenous ERVs?

First of all, ERVs are easily detectable because they have particular viral structures. See [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6me6m3/creationists_accidentally_make_case_for_evolution/dkb8ksx/) on it to get into detail. BTW: the LTRs I was talking about in that post are particular DNA sequences (along with other ones like ENVs) that are beyond any doubt retroviral. To explain further: retroviruses, just like all other viruses, are not able to reproduce by themselves. Viruses need the biochemical machinery of host cells to do the trick for them. They are parasites. 

Normally a virus just nestles itself in the cytoplasm of the host cell and trigger the cell mechanism for its own purpose. Retroviruses accomplish the same goal by nestling themselves directly into the cell's DNA. For that it needs a mechanism called reverse transcriptase. And genes that accomplish reverse transcriptase. These genes are due to their particular functions easily identifiable as it is quite distinct from the host cell's genes. The genes that are identified as coding for reverse transcriptase are “gag” (matrix, capsid, nucleoproteins), “pol“ (protease, reverse transcriptase, RNaseH, dUTPase, integrase) and “env” (subunit and transmembrane). This core is flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). Finally, when the retrovirus splits the host genome for insertion, some of the torn original host DNA is recopied on either side of the viral insert. This is also quite identifiable.

In this way the genes that cause nestling of the embryo and immune suppression are easily identifiable as ERVs.

But there is more. In order to nestle itself in the uterus wall, it must invade it. For that it needs mechanisms that break away the cells of the uterus wall. Viruses do have such mechanisms. They also need to invade cells by breaking through their cell membranes. Furthermore, the embryo must be protected against the maternal immune system by suppressing it to some degree. Suppressing the immune system of hosts obviously is a specialty of viruses. So any ERV already sitting in the mammal genome already has two important features that serve well as mechanisms in embryonic nestling and immune system suppression.

If they have no knowledge of what ERVs are, they'll have the image in their mind that ERVs are literally just specks of DNA that look similar, and declare that these are put there as a sign of ""common design,"" either as a divine signature or some kind of essential function that can be copy-pasted across all life forms that carry it.

The alternative is to claim that (some) ERVs have function, and because they pull up some nonsense study about how it's probabilistically impossible for an ERV to mutate into having a function in the host, therefore it couldn't have been a retroviral insertion; no, it had to have been put there in its present state by some divine being.

144,"&gt; Tiktaalik has been debunked greatly for quite a large amount of time now.

NOT that I know and particularly this line of scientific literature I know quite well.

First of all, Tiktaalik indeed belongs to the lobe-finned fish. But that is not relevant. Relevant are the parts of the observational evidence you conveniently - and as I may follow your explanation you read the literature on evolution well, *deliberately* leave away. The *actual* reason why Tiktaalik is a transitional form is because it had traits that unique tetrapods have. Tetrapods are the four-legged animals. Here are the tetrapod characteristics of Tiktaalik:

- bony skeletal structures

- rib bones

- large pelvic girdle and appendage and paired pelvis

- prominent hip joint, and long hind fins

- mobile neck with separate pectoral girdle

- not lateral eyes but eyes on top of the head

- lungs and, consequently, nostrils. Tiktaalik also still had gills. Having both lungs and gills are *exactly* one would expect to find in transitional fossils.

It also had features that are partly fish-like but also partly tetrapodal:

- half-fish, half-tetrapod limb bones and joints, including a functional wrist joint and radiating, fish-like fins instead of toes
- half-fish, half-tetrapod ear region.

Want nice pictures? Here is a [nice one](https://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/17/30/76/23/f1_lar10.jpg). Look at the sequence in part A. From the left to the right you see the fore-limbs of: 

1. Chondrichthyans (class of fish that have cartilage skeletons, examples are sharks and rays and the like). 

2. Polydon (an example of the ray-finned fish like paddlefish and sturgeons).

3. Danio (a class of fresh water fish like carps, barbs etc.). 

4. Suaripterus is a true, extinct lobe-finned fish of the order of rhizodonts.

5. Tiktaalik.

6. Acanthostega (one of the earliest tetrapods with clear limbs, yet it lacked wrists and it had 8 digits in a webbed fashion). 

&gt; None of the lobe-fin fish in existence, including Tiktaalik, have bones attaching their fins to the axial skeleton. The bones attached are extremely delicate. Therefore it is believed that the fins on the Tiktaalik are not used to carry weight, and subsequently not for walking.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLh4ODMBGJE) (Mudskipper), here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZdavNHGUho) and here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUk8JzGwBHo) are examples of *extant* fish that walk the land on a regular basis. *none* of these fish have their fins attached to their axial skeletons. Yet they walk.

&gt; The bones attached are extremely delicate.

The limb bones of Tiktaalik were *not* delicate, they were bony, robust and sturdy. As the picture above clearly shows.

Even if Tiktaalik did not crawl the land, it *still* is a perfect transitional species because as a fish, it had clear features that are unique to the later tetrapods. But Tiktaalik DID crawl the land beyond any reasonable doubt. There is *a reason* for such an animal to have lungs, sturdy, robust ribs and limbs. Robust ribs indicate the animal did roam the land because such ribs are to make breathing through lungs possible when the animal is out of water and thus experience the downwards pressure of gravitation. A robust pelvis and bony limbs indicate there was weight to be transplanted. 

&gt; On a side note, footprints indented on limestone slabs found in Poland show a track of an organisms which is dated at 397 mya. That means that and organism, which could walk on land, already existed 18 million years BEFORE Tiktaalik, making the Tiktaalik NOT the transitional fossil which bridges the gap between fish and land animals. 

Wow they did find that? How interesting. Indeed the tracks found in Poland did precede Tiktaalik 18 millions of years. And, guess what, those same people who found all these tracks and Tiktaalik and other fossils, STILL say that Tiktaalik is transitional form between fish and tetrapods.

In a stable environment or ecosystem, natural selection favors stability. You'll see relatively little evolutionary change. When something disrupts that stability, selective pressures change and evolution occurs rapidly until a balance is achieved. Like so many things in nature, evolution strives for equilibrium. These relatively stable periods can last for a very long time and abruptly end- just look at the end of the dinosaurs preceding the rise of the mammals. 

To claim punctuated equilibrium doesn't exist is to claim environmental equilibrium doesn't exist. Yet the Namib desert has existed for 80 million years.

155,"I appreciate all of your responses. Let’s get right into it. You both provided a list of what you assume to be examples of transitional forms. However, I can assure you not one is an example of a transitional form nor example of speciation and or “macroevolution.”

The Faroe Island Mice Mus musculus L.) are great examples of variation within organisms, but not great examples speciation, nor macroevolution. In fact, the example of Faroe Mice actually goes with the popular claim of speciation in Darwin’s Finches, which has been shown to not be speciation in terms of evolution, as it was only adaptation. 

It is important to know that in order for speciation (and as a result macro-evolution) to occur, the species of an organism must be so drastically different than their counterparts; so different that they must not be able to procreate with the organisms they once “evolved” from. However, this has NEVER been observed, both in the fossil record (really the only thing you can prove about fossils is that they died) and by scientists. 

Due to this reasoning, we can understand that the Faroe Island Mouse is NOT an example of speciation nor an example of macroevolution, simply because Faroe Mouse can still REPRODUCE with other mice everywhere around the world. Also making it not an example of speciation and/or macroevolution is that the organism is still a mouse. In order to provide evidence of evolutionary biology in terms of the proving the theory of life, a new organism would have to be created as a result of evolution (think lizard evolving over millions and millions of years into a snake). That example would be completely sound with the theory and would also prove it if it were observed. However, the amount by which the transition of organisms to the masses of a lizard-to-snake evolution (organism to brand new organism), has never been observed and will never be an example of evolution if not observed. The same applies to the Faroe Island Mice. They are still mice (in Linnaean Taxonomy they would be in the same family), and can still reproduce with other mice, therefore constituting the example as a transitional fossil, false. 

The same still applies to European Blackcaps (they can still reproduce with other birds and are still birds). The example is simply a great observation of adaptation, which has never and never will lead to macroevolution. Same goes for Apple Maggot Flies, Central African Cichlids, London Underground Mosquitos, which have been debunked like crazy, and finally Heliconius Butterflies). These are all simple examples of speciation, but not speciation which leads to a brand new organism which has has never been in the Universal Family Tree of Linnaean Taxonomy.

160,"Since Gould and Eldredge coined PE, a lot of discussion has been going on. Here are some highlights:

- the fast instances of radiation could also explained by migration. When environmental conditions change, species may migrate away or back off to areas where their favourable living conditions still prevail. So in such areas those species ""all of a sudden"" appear, making it to look like as if fast evolution took place. This is not always explaining PE away but it's a factor to count with.

- PE may be confined to certain regions during a certain period but in the same time frame not present in other regions.

- Darwin never thought that evolutionary pace should be the same all time. In the fourth edition (1866) of On the Origin of Species Darwin wrote that ""the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form."" In modern jargon this is observation is called ""punctuated equilibrium"".

- the stasis period may be real stasis but also slow, gradual change. In that case PE means periods of slow gradual change intermitted by instances of rather fast evolution.

In other words, PE and gradualism, especially when defined not in a black/white fashion, are quite compatible. Gould and Eldredge take pains to explicitly point out that PE is an expansive theory, not an exclusive one.

That having said, the main evidence for PE is found in the fossil evidence. And this is positive evidence. You may go back to Gould and Eldredge themselves who extremely well-documented and extensively examined two separate lines of evidence: pulmonate gastropods and the other one involving Phacopsid trilobites.

There are definitely instances of rapid evolution observable in the fossil record, often (but not exclusively) just after mass extinction events, when whole niches have become vacant, triggering fast radiation in speciation. The Cambrian explosion is just one of those. The rapid radiation of mammals after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (causing the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs).

So it escapes me somehow how someone would deny PE.

A little more add on. 

What I am saying is that the “fossil record” isn’t evidence of evolution if you cannot explain how those organisms evolved in the first place. I agree, the “fossil record” record does for the most part fit with evolution. But, that is ONLY because scientists made it fit a specific story by which they created. Evolution doesn’t and never did predict the sequence of evolution; scientists observed it and made it fit the theory of evolution. That doesn’t “prove” evolution nor adds substantial evidence to it.  

There are of course problems with predictions through evolution in terms of the sequence of the fossil record. The fossil record lacks evolutions biggest prediction: transitional forms. There are no transitional forms that have been shown to back up macro-evolution, and from what we have seen, never will.

165,"&gt; It seems that in order to “prove” punctuated equilibrium, you must first “prove” or provide clear conclusive evidence of speciation. 

The idea of punctuated equilibrium, as an alternative for gradualism, is about the *pace* of evolutionary change: long periods of relative stasis (""equilibrium""), intermitted by instances of rather fast evolution (""punctuated""). Those instances BTW, may last some millions of years BTW, ""puntuated"" is meant on geological scale.

PE has been coined by Gould and Eldredge, both were paleontologists. So let's answer your point from a paleontological perspective: the fossil record. So let's have it:

- the geological formations below our feet constitute many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer was a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ripples and buried dune structures indicate a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you might see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a sea floor again, ending up in shallow sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that it contains fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversely, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land plants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial mats.

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: the biodiversity changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. Such a change in biodiversity is called evolution.

And, note that I did not make any assumptions about the factor time: I ONLY implied that geological formations differ greatly in biodiversity. I did not say anything about their age or about which one were to be older or younger. I do not need to assert anything about time to prove that the fossil record unambiguously and inescapably forces us to conclude that life changed over time during the natural history of the earth. There is no getting around it.

I get what you’re trying to say, and I more or less even agree with you. But unfortunately that’s just not how our creationist friends operate. They accept things like nuclear radiation (I mean we have literally weaponized it and use it for power, how could they reject it?) but then they turn right around and reject radiometric dating. They accept things like “microevolution”  and then turn around and reject “macroevolution”. My point in my original comment was to point out that if something in science doesn’t directly affect their god belief, then they don’t care about it. While you are correct that in the broad sense the laws of physics do pose quite a problem for god. That’s just not how creationists see it, I mean we’re talking about a being that is capable of anything, the creationists only have a problem when something in science directly contradicts the Bible. For example with evolution, the Bible says there are “kinds” and it gets the order of appearance wrong; so creationists say evolution is wrong. However, the Bible doesn’t say much about stars, just that god created them; so no matter what science says about inside of stars, most creationists will just say “yeah that’s how god did it”.

175,"First, thank you for, by not arguing against my main point, acknowledging that Mendel omits neutral mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with number 1, but it makes no sense. ""Requiring some mutations only be neutral in combination with others""? What? All I said was that the fitness effects of specific mutations can change over time. I didn't bring up epistasis. (Though Mendel omits that, too.)

&amp;nbsp;

And number 2, now *you're* omitting neutral mutations. Something could have no effects under some conditions, and persist via drift, but be beneficial under other conditions. 

And this comment highlights another huge flaw in Mendel: No gene duplication. Sure you can have mutations like sickle-cell that can be harmful in homozygotes, but if you have an extra copy of that gene, you reduce the frequency of the unfit phenotypes. By failing to include that mechanism, Mendel misses an important source of not just diversity, but redundancy against harmful mutations.

Consider a critter than exists in an environment whose conditions are stable over geologically-relevant periods of time. Since the environment *is* stable, that means the adaptations which allow a critter to thrive in that environment are, by that same token, going to remain pretty much the same. So as time passes, and mutations that make it better-adapted to its stable environment accumulate, the ""low hanging fruit"" of easy adaptations will become increasingly rare, so mutations which make the critter *more* well-suited to its stable environment will occur less and less frequently. Thus, the critter will experience a slowing in its rate of evolutionary change.

Now consider critters in environments which are *not* stable over geologically-relevant periods of time. Since the environment is changing, that means the adaptations which allow a critter to thrive in that environment are probably going to change as well. Thus, a critter that lives in a changing environment has a wider range of potentially-beneficial mutations than does a critter that lives in a stable environment, so the changing-environment critter is likely to experience a higher rater of evolutionary change than is the stable-environment critter.",1,1510835062,2017-11-16 07:24:22

Well that's found to be wrong. Yet *another* flaw added to the already extensive list. When a species 

&gt; Thus Mendel's model of beneficial vs neutral mutations is extremely generous to your case--there's no irreducible complexity that requires two or more simultaneous mutations before increasing fitness.

It is not generous. It leaves away complexity where new structures or cellular pathways are formed by a multi-stage evolutionary process, which are thought to be rather common. For instance, as observed in Lenski's LTE experiment.

&gt; Both of the changes you're suggesting would make evolution less likely to succeed...

This is wrong. *On top* of beneficial mutations that directly take effect, we *also* have multi-stage mutations.

&gt; Mutations that are fitness context dependent are rare enough not to have a significant effect. 

ALL mutations are fitness context dependent.

&gt; We've cataloged hundreds of thousands of disease causing and disease-risk-increasing mutations in humans. The percentage of these that confer other benefits is minuscule.

Totally irrelevant. OF COURSE disease causing and disease-risk-increasing mutations are harmful. 

&gt; Among the mutations that have context-dependent fitness effects, most of them operate by degrading or destroying a gene product.

When a gene is not functional anymore due to changing environments, for instance a gene that codes for a trait that is related to live in aquatic environments in an animal that lives in an environment that becomes arid, disabling this gene by degrading or destroying it, is part of the normal evolutionary change to adapt to changing living conditions. The idea that ""gene degrading or destruction"" is against evolutionary thought is the very next strawman among hundreds of other distortions by creationists.

That's why we see so many vestigial organs and structures in about all living organisms.

In the same time we see an enormous amount of genetic innovation in the fossil record.

So about everything in the second part of your post is wrong and contradicted by the observational evidence.

Here is why even functional parts may catch neutral mutations:

- most of active, functional genes are redundant. The actual functional part of, for instance, cyt-c is ~30%. So 70% of the gene that codes for cyt-c may be hit by mutations without having any effect.

- lot of mutations in the 30% functional part don't change the amino acid sequence.

&gt;Will you take back what you said above about Mendel assuming there are no neutral mutations?

Is there a way to code neutral mutations in Mendel? No. They're either beneficial or deleterious. So you're arguing they just get left out, and that's good enough? Uh...no. That's not how it works. Neutral mutations are an important source of genetic diversity, and can become useful later on. 

This get's at another of Mendel's flaws: assuming constant fitness landscape. Fitness effects are context-dependent, and can change depending on the genetic and ecological context. Assigning a constant fitness coefficient to each mutation, or even a assigning it permanently to one of two categories, is completely unrealistic. And while that's a different issue from the inability to include neutral mutations, it's related. 

So you can't just leave them out neutral mutations and reduce the overall mutation rate by whatever fraction you think is neutral. That's not how it works. 

So no, I'm not taking back a thing. Mendel presupposes every mutation has a fitness effect, and this is clearly, egregiously, wrong. ",1,1510796878,2017-11-15 20:47:58

235,"Instead of this irrelevant tattle, you better START to address the point made instead of evading them, which were:

- Neutral mutations - the program classifies mutations as having some selection coefficient. Genes are not free to mutate within boundaries provided that the selection coefficient is zero. This is in direct contravention to innumerable papers on genetics, starting with Kimmura's original one on neutral mutations. The ability for random mutation to explore neutral sequence space has been well documented.

In other words: the program does not acknowledge the existence of neutral mutations. Which is WEIRD in thet light of modern genetics.

- Linkage - the program classifies genes as dominant (+) or recessive (-), there are no other choices. Gene linkage allows harmful genes to piggy back on beneficial, successful genes.

In other words: the program does not count in an important genetic mechanism which is found to explain why certain traits tend to be inherited together, something that puzzled geneticists already shortly after Mendel published his word.

- Sexual selection - the program does not simulate sexual selection at all. Sexual selection allows harmful mutations (eg. peacock's tail) to accumulate because they are favourable for reproductive success.

Leaving away sexual selection as the important component of natural selection is an UNFORGIVABLE omission and renders any model doing this INSTANTLY useless for any sound evolutionary simulation.

- Duplication - the program does not allow for gene duplication events. Simple thought experimentation reveals that a duplicated gene is free to vary provided that the original gene maintains function. Thus harmful mutations in the duplicated gene are less harmful overall but beneficial mutations are still emphasized. Furthermore, the duplicated gene may assume a novel function.

Leaving away gene duplication as an crucial genetic mechanism is an UNFORGIVABLE omission and renders any model doing this INSTANTLY useless for any sound evolutionary simulation.

- Sanford's definition of fitness is flawed. He seems to think that ""full fitness"" equals 1. He's assuming that there is a such thing as ideal fitness and that's completely wrong. Some genotypes are favorable in some environments, others are favorable in other environments.

This is not a small mistake. It's a fatal elephantic flaw. It means that, apart from not including sexual selection, it also factually discards natural selection as an important evolutionary mechanism.

&gt; He also does not factor in things like hybridization and genetic drift--all of which are instrumental in speciation.

Did he not count in these factors as well?

Wow, are there ANY things he included *in the first place*?

&gt; Sanford claims outside of complete neutral mutations, 99.9999999999% of all mutations are somewhere between -1 (lethal) and 0 (neutral). True beneficial mutations are so rare you can basically ignore them. 

Apart from the problems mentioned in [RibosomalTransferRNA's](/u/RibosomalTransferRNA) post, this *assumption* about the frequency of harmful mutatiions is not found back in the genetic literature, [on the contrary](https://news.utexas.edu/2016/08/02/bacteria-show-capacity-for-rapid-beneficial-mutations). 

So basically Mendel's Account is applying unsubstantiated figures that are contradicted by actual genetic research. As RibosomalTransferRNA's post already mentioned:

&gt; It is based on a simplistic computer model with no empirical evidence to support it. In science, you get the evidence then you make the model. He made the model without any evidence, he made it instead assuming all mutations are bad and of course it shows that evolution is not possible.

Mendel's Account is NOT about evolution. I have no idea what exactly it simulates, but it has NOTHING to do with evolution as it is conceived and backed by extensive empirical evidence.

246,"From /u/arthurpaliden:

Extract from another forum in regards to John Stafford (genetic entropy):

I went to see a creationist today. Not sure why I did this as it I rarely make it to North Campus for even the most important things and why I'd want to be infuriated on a Saturday afternoon is a mystery. The main crux of his argument is that he's shown evolution by natural selection is not possible using a computer model he (and his colleagues) wrote 10 years ago. Somehow from this he thinks the Earth is 10,000 years old, humans rode dinosaurs, and all the evidence for evolution is wrong. The argument is that mutations are too detrimental to ever result in new variation and adaptation. He calls this ""Genetic Entropy.""

There are two main reasons John Sanford's Genetic Entropy argument is completely off base:

1. It is based on a simplistic computer model with no empirical evidence to support it. In science, you get the evidence then you make the model. He made the model without any evidence, he made it instead assuming all mutations are bad and of course it shows that evolution is not possible.

2. Sanford's definition of fitness is flawed. He seems to think that ""full fitness"" equals 1. He's assuming that there is a such thing as ideal fitness and that's completely wrong. Some genotypes are favorable in some environments, others are favorable in other environments. For example, dark skin is favorable in areas near the equator (prevents melanoma/skin cancers) but unfavorable away from the equator (leads to other cancers and rickets). Light skin is the opposite, near the equator whites will get melonoma, but away from the equator they'll have lower incidences of other cancers and rickets. The same is true for every single attribute in every organism. Besides null mutations (those destroying the reproductive system or killing the animal), there are no mutations that cannot be beneficial in some circumstances.

There are other problems. He doesn't factor in environmental influence in his model because he considers it noise. What? Does he know what natural selection is? He also does not factor in things like hybridization and genetic drift--all of which are instrumental in speciation.

He claims his model, called Mendel's Accountant is the most complex and comprehensive computer simulation for genetic evolution ever created. Fine, but it's still too simplistic in comparison to the real world. He makes assumptions like the beneficial mutation rate and the selection rate--both of which are arbitrarily drawn up by him.

I did get to ask a question though I'm quite sure the audience did not know the significance of it. Dr. Sanford claims outside of complete neutral mutations, 99.9999999999% of all mutations are somewhere between -1 (lethal) and 0 (neutral). True beneficial mutations are so rare you can basically ignore them. I said,""You don't know all the factors interacting with this mutation, so to say something is slightly negative is an assumption. I guess what I'm getting at, is do you have an example of a slightly deleterious mutation?""

He replied ""There have been many experiments done where we expose--for example plants to radiation and most of them die and you get all sorts of weird stuff. But these things usually die or can't reproduce. You don't want mutations in your genome because it's bad--give me a show of hands how many people want mutations in their genomes?""

See how simplistic his argument is? How simple minded you have to be to accept anything he says? Of course no one wants mutations in their genomes, but we're not talking about mutations in living animals, we're talking about mutations in germ lines. You can't get evolution from mutations in a living organism.

I wanted to then say, ""but those aren't acted upon by natural selection and they aren't examples of slightly deleterious mutations"" but I was cut off by a person telling Dr. Sanford it was over. It's really a shame, because his entire model breaks down when you realize there is no example of a mutation that is passed on, but slightly deleterious.

Overall it was underwhelming. He started with saying he'd come to the revelation through evidence that evolution was wrong and the Bible was right, but all he presented was a computer program. Don't get too excited about having this lunatic on your side, creationists. His argument won't convince anyone but the most feeble minded.

http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showthread.php?t=161310

The simulation software that John Sanford wrote , Mendel's Accountant, and used as the basis for his ideas was never peer reviewed as to its relationship to the biological sciences. It was only every peer reviewed from a computer architecture standpoint in regards to simulations. Now when looked at from a strictly biological stand point at least four problems have been identified with the properties of the simulation:

1. Neutral mutations - the program classifies mutations as having some selection coefficient. Genes are not free to mutate within boundaries provided that the selection coefficient is zero. This is in direct contravention to innumerable papers on genetics, starting with Kimmura's original one on neutral mutations. The ability for random mutation to explore neutral sequence space has been well documented.

2. Linkage - the program classifies genes as dominant (+) or recessive (-), there are no other choices. Gene linkage allows harmful genes to piggy back on beneficial, successful genes.

3. Sexual selection - the program does not simulate sexual selection at all. Sexual selection allows harmful mutations (eg. peacock's tail) to accumulate because they are favourable for reproductive success.

The issue is that there's on reason to think they _did_.  Further, it does not explain things like endogenous retroviruses, which show an increasing number as organisms grow more closely related and yet have no purpose from the ""engineering"" perspective.

Essentially, it's the difference between explaining and predicting.  All extant tetrapods use the same sorts of hand bones; this can be _explained_ either by creation or evolution.  However, looking closer, bats, birds, and pterodactyls have different sorts of wings.  Why would a creator not reuse their established wing-pattern?  Why one sort over another?  Why not a fourth option?  You can hand-wave answers for this, but that's merely _explaining_.  Evolution _predicts_ these differences; it has a solid answer for _why_ they're different, and why we'd expect to find such differences in the first place.

Or, to highlight the problem with your argument directly: every bit of meat you eat could come from processed humans.  Why don't you believe they _did?_

&gt;Isn't the whole point of evolution that species gain new features their ancestors didn't have?

Yes, but by means of mutation.  This usually means that larger changes are a matter of reorganizing or repurposing other things, like how jaws arose from gills.  A bird suddenly having fully-formed mammaries of the sort possessed by modern mammals would be extremely unexpected, and suggest that there's something we'd missed or didn't understand.

&gt;Would the absence of a precambrian flying spaghetti monster also be evidence of evolution? Is this what you count as evidence for evolution?

Still missing the point there.  The reason a Precambrian rabbit would serve to dispute evolution is that rabbits are far more complex than any other Precambrian life, and would contradict our established phylogenetic understanding of rabbits at a minimum.

Remember, when we first figured out biochemistry, it didn't change all that much; what we learned about genetics fit right in with Darwinian Evolution - hence the whole Neo-Darwinian Synthesis thing.

Evolution in the simplest sense is all about changes in the gene pools of populations over time.  If you could provide evidence that mutation doesn't work like we think it does, we'd have to rethink that aspect of evolution.  If you could provide evidence that natural selection doesn't work the way we think it does, we'd have to rethink that aspect of evolution.  In every case we _would_ try to put together a working model; that's rather the point.  And our models to this point have worked wonderfully; the predictions made by evolutionary theory have not only been a tremendous boon in research but in applications ranging from medicine to agriculture to computer science.

&gt; In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.

In this sense, evolution is a 'fact'. I realise you are approaching this discussion from the perspective where you are not yet convinced that evolution is a fact, but that doesn't make it an assumption on my part. I would propose that there are assumptions, and then there are facts that people have yet to accept.

&gt; I'm not convinced evolution is falsifiable either.

Karl Popper did a lot of work on the philosophy of whether or not science is falsifiable. He went through a period where he wasn't so sure, either. [You might be interested in what he had to say over the years.](https://ncse.com/cej/6/2/what-did-karl-popper-really-say-evolution)

Oh boy, the “software fallacy” again. There is no reason at all why an omnipotent creator would have to drag along pieces of “deprecated code” in his successive creations just like software designers have to. New versions of a program need to remain compatible with preceding ones precisely because software programs “evolve” from previous versions and they need to maintain compatibility. 

By the way software engineers hate being forced to keep/maintain deprecated functionality because inherently, within the logic of the current version, there is no point in doing so and it creates all sorts of problems. They only do so because they have to. Now an omnipotent creator doesn’t have this problem so why would he create a vestigial pelvis and hind limbs in whales?

If we would accept intelligent design as a scientific hypothesis, it could be effectively falsified if we found unnecessary structures like vestigial organs. In fact, we do find those and really lots of them too, which festively falsifies ID.

One of creationists biggest arguments is that there's no such thing as an increase of genetic inflammation, or X is to complicated to service, or macro evolution is impossible. Those are basically themes of the same argument, there's a genetic limit to evolution.

Dipite that being arguably their main claim, not once have they ever even tried to show that genetic mutation is limited in anyway what so ever. If you could show that, and in some hypothetical universe where evolution isn't true you could, you would have just falsified evolution.

There are hundreds of examples of things that could falsify evolution. I gave you a bunch.

290,"&gt; I'm not really familiar with ERVs (endogenous retrovirus?). 

The crash-course version is this: there are relatively rare cases where viruses will modify an organism's germline DNA, passing onto offspring a very unique marker which can persist for many, *many* generations. If two living organisms have the same unique ""fingerprint"" in the same location in their respective genomes, then they share a common ancestor that had that same ERV. The chance that two unrelated organisms would have the same unique ""fingerprint"" at the same spot in their genomes would be *astronomical*. The ancestral tree we get from comparing genetic markers like ERVs closely matches what we already knew from fossil evidence. 

In fact, genetics has allowed us to refine our knowledge in many cases, pinpointing more precisely those extinct species that are cousins of each other, and those that are direct ancestors or descendants. One example is that of bats: it was once thought that (based on fossil evidence alone) that megabats might be descended from primates, and [ts not hard to see why.](https://wckedmara.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/flying-fox-malayan-3.jpg) Based on genetic evidence, though, we now know that all bats (megabats and microbats) share a common basal bat ancestor - they are monophyletic.

&gt; As far as I can know, you can't. 

You and I will agree here. Creationism/ID is not (in the broadest sense) falsifiable, as a powerful enough creator could be resourceful enough to fool us, to make things look as if they had evolved. This is why, for example, John Marburger, George W. Bush's Science  Advistor once remarked that ""Intelligent design is not a scientific theory..."" and that he doesn't ""regard intelligent design as a scientific topic.""

&gt; Which is why I don't understand of genetics can be considered good evidence for evolution over intelligent design.

Genetics (and evolutionary theory in general) make testable predictions which come true on a daily basis, and form the basis for a lot of useful and practical applications. For science, that's sufficient. But again, when it comes to pseudoscience like ID/creationism, no amount of credible evidence can be enough to disprove it.

Let's carry that analogy one step further. As a software developer myself, I'm familiar with source control systems like git and svn. Just as good software development consists of tracking all code changes as well as branches in development, geneticists can track ancestry using things like ERVs. Because of biomolecular evidence like ERVs (but certainly nowhere near limited to them) we know that evolution consists of processes that happen over very long time periods - millions and *billions* of years. 

This brings me back to my original question at the end of my previous comment which you have yet to answer: if there is a designer that takes existing forms/blueprints/etc and makes slight changes, iteratively, over millions of years, ***how then do we tell that apart from entirely natural processes that are capable of doing the same thing?***

You better jump to the observational evidence directly.

The very simple start of any debate with creationits is to just start with ""evolution is a observed fact"". An d here's why:

- the geological formations below our feet show many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer was a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ribbles and buried dune structures indicate a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you might see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a sea floor again, ending up in shallow sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that they contain fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ).

- whole classes of species that are living today are lacking in the older formations and there is, literally, not a single specimen to be found that breaks this rule.

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: life forms changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. And a constantly changing biodiversity is just another word for ""evolution"".

And, note that I did not make any assumptions about the factor time: I ONLY implied that geological formations differ greatly in biodiversity. I did not say anything about their age or about which one were to be older or younger. I do not need to assert anything about time to prove that the fossil record unambiguously and inescapably *forces* us to conclude that life changed over time during the natural history of the earth.

No they do not come up with explanations of how an observation could be explained with evolution. This practice is common among creationists, it's the hallmark of creationism: only accept the evidence that does not contradict the bible and disregard the rest. 

First of all, there are numerous ways to falsify evolution. But yet, until now, nobody ever managed to actually falsify it. 

Secondly, this is simply not how science works. When **biologists** (the correct wording for ""evolutionists"") come up with an explanation for an observed phenomenon, it must cover all aspects of such observation. When one part of the observation is not covered, you immediately will encounter a lot of critique by peer biologists pointing you out to that and demanding an account for the unexplained facts.

311,"&gt; That source just lists species and asserts that they are transitional. Can you provide actual evidence for why they are transitional?

Fossils are transitional because they show a graduate change in all relevant traits. So why are you asking when on the Wiki page you can examine all presented transitional species? Why should I do your work to check out the presented evidence? For instance, on [the Wiki section on the evolution of whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils#Early_artiodactylans_to_whales) you see all the transitional species listed. You can click on each link as well as to the explanatory Wiki article [""Evolution of whales""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_whales), linked to on top of that section.

But, not for you but for others here with a more sincere attitude, here's the information:

- cetaceans like whales and dolphines are mammals because they share traits with other mammals that are unique to them.

- cetaceans share traits that are unique for artiodactyl mammals. Artiodactyls are the even-toed ungulates.

- of all extant animals, the DNA of cetaceans resembles most that of hippopotamus, a land dwelling artiodactyl.

- we have a whole bunch of fossil cetacean species that clearly show the change in traits from artiodactyls to extant whales and dolphins: the nostrils migrating to the top of the head becoming the blow holes, the gradual loss of hind limbs and the pelvis, forelimbs becoming flippers, increase in vertebrae, change in sacral bones, in baleen hwales the gradual loss of teeth etc. etc.

- we know these fossils belonged to cetaceans because they have unique traits that are typical for cetaceans and set them apart from other animals.

More detail [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/78lq1t/when_whales_walked/dowsf9x/).

As a matter of fact, in that post I decribe the cetacean species Dodudon. It has quite typical hind limbs.

- first of all, they were extremely small for such rather large animal (Dorudon was ~ 5 meters tall and weighted up to some 2 tons). The size of Dorudon’s hind limbs was about a modern housecat’s ones. I don’t think an animal that long and heavy could have walked with such small hind limbs.

- but, moreover, the pelvis was detached from its spinal cord. You just can’t walk with hind limbs detached from the spinal cord. You cannot even use it properly to propel.

- also much of the ankle bones and carpals were fused as well, again making walking impossible.

Now WHAT was a fully aquatic, marine animal doing with such vertebrate, artiodactyl hind limbs in the first place?

If we hadn't find any other cetacean fossil but only Dorudon, it already would had been a comp0letely sufficient evidence for the evolution of the cetaceans from an artiodactyl origin.

314,"&gt;Can you provide actual evidence for why they are transitional?

It's explained pretty well in the links to the individual fossils. But in short they are transitional because they display features that are intermediate between two groups. And to be extra clear it's not begging the question to say that, those intermediatefeatures would exist no matter what you wanted to believe.

Take Archaeopteryx for example, a fossil long held as an example of a transitional form in large part because it's so obvious (creationists being the only people during the last century and a half who dispute this)

It has feathers which are an obvious bird feature.

It has a proper jaw with teeth and a boney tail, obvious reptile features.

It has partially fused bones in its wing. litterly half a wing. A feature that's intermediate between those two groups.

It doesn't matter what you believe those are indisputable facts. It's also a fact there are many more reptile/bird fossils out there showing different stages.

You asked why a common creator isn't a good answer... well because you can't explain observable facts with that assumption. And more importantly you can make predictions about what fossils we will find in the future. 

Evolution can and has answered questions about what we observe and what we will find in the future. It also explains why bats insects and birds all developed different ways to fly.

All you have is ""God did it"" so can I ask what evidence do you have to support that. If God is acting on our world in a noticeable way that would certainly be in the relm of science to test and measure. ",1,1510441497,2017-11-11 18:04:57

No, we *observe* transitional fossils. [Here is a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils) of 24 evolutionary transitions by fossil evidence. This is only a short list. So [GuyInAChair's](/u/GuyInAChair) question again, a little moderated: how would you explain *this observed* huge number of intermediate or transitional fossils?

&gt; That's not evidence for evolution. That's evidence that given evolution is true, mammals must have evolved from reptiles.

No, that's what we *observe*. We *observe* strata with reptiles which lack fossils of mammals. We can tell because both mammals and reptiles have unique, observable and traceable traits. But layers above those we find both reptiles and reptiles which start to exhibit *some* mammal traits. And some more layers above, we start to *observe* animals that have more mammals traits. And then some more layers above the first animals that have all traits that set mammals apart.

Evolution predicts such transitions. It is a hypothesis like: if evolution is true, we must find transitions of non-mammals animals to mammals. And indeed we find them. And then you say: ""no that's only assuming evolution"". That's not only humbug but also extremely dishonest.

Evolution is an observation by only the fossil record.

The fossil record of each geological formation is unique in the way that they contain fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants - not even *one single* specimen. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ).

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: life changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. ""Life changed over time"" is only another way of saying ""evolution happened"".

And, note that I did not make any assumptions about the factor time: I ONLY implied that geological formations differ greatly in biodiversity. I did not say anything about their age or even about which one was older or younger. I do not need to assert anything about time to prove that the fossil record unambiguously and inescapably *forces* us to conclude that life changed over time during the natural history of the earth. There is no getting around it.

&gt; This wouldn't be expected by evolution because evolving half sized wings that are too small to fly with, are usually an evolutionary disadvantage, so evolving from no wings to fully functioning wings would be extremely rare if not impossible, not something you would expect to happen repeatedly.

Unless those half sized wings are forelimbs the animal still can use for all other purposes forelimbs are for. Mostly, evolution is about adjusting *existing* features to serve new purposes. Even in extant life we observe animals that have ""half wings"", like gliding squirrels that use their forelimbs for all purposes normal for forelimbs (walking, climbing, grabbing food etc.) but also to glide by employing a flap of furry skin (the patagium) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. So your comment is already directly falsified by *[numerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_and_gliding_animals)* examples in *extant* life.

Furthermore, the release of energy from such an event would boil Earth's ocean, making a flood impossible.

The Flood cannot explain angular uncomformities and erosion should be evenly distributed throughout the world meaning rock formations would be shaped the same way.

346,"&gt; My counter argument to this is that this ""prediction"" can also be considered as evidence for a common creator. All life forms sharing certain things in common can be equally considered evidence for a common creator. 

Where we run into problems, however, is that there are organisms who share common features that we would *not* expect from a competent designer. For example, we would not expect whales and dolphins to have the genetic machinery (albeit, usually deactivated) for hind limbs. When such ancestral genes become activated by mistake, they present in the form of [atavisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atavism). [ERVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus) are among other examples.

Now, you could make the argument that the creator created by taking existing blueprints and making modifications, leaving clues to the ancestry of design iterations, but then how would we differentiate between a creator whose actions virtually mimic evolutionary processes as we know them today, versus evolutionary processes that are entirely unguided?

I guess you could say that God created in such a way that the fossil record resembled what one would expect if evolution were true. But than you're inserting magic in place of an answer with plenty of evidentiary backing.

A common designer also fails to answer how or why some organisms have the same function but different ""engineering"". Bats, birds, pterodactyls, insects, etc... all fly but do so in very different manners. So how and why and when did God create these things? And these are not common designs at all, did they have different designers? How could you answer that question other than an assertion based on your religious beliefs.

Evolution does have an answer. Convergent evolution, when the same selective forces are in play but nature gives different solutions to the same problem. And there's also tons of examples of this, either in morphology or in genetics.

God did it isn't an acceptable answer to any other question we can or could ask. Why is traffic bad? God did it!?!?! Why am I sick? Why is it winter? Why is there a storm?

The  reason god did it isn't an acceptable answer to any of those questions and many more is that there's no evidence of God every intervening in any of those things. There's also no evidence of God intervening in biology either. While it might be tempting to insert God as an answer to complex problems we may not have the answer to, it's never been a correct answer the 1000's of times we've tried it in the past.

*According to the paleoevidence, all species persisted morphologically unchanged in the paleorecord for a mean time period of about T = 3 x 10^6 years (three million years) and then became extinct. (Namely this relative morphological constancy allows one to unambiguously ascribe particular remnants to a particular species.) It is established that the species life span does not depend on body size and population size (species abundance). It is on average the same for small unicellular species with huge populations and for macroscopic multicellular species of, e.g., mammals, birds, etc., who have population sizes by many orders of magnitude smaller. Total number of species N inhabiting the biosphere at any give moment of time, despite considerable fluctuations, did not change its order of magnitude. Currently it is about several million species (3-10 million). This means that extinction of old species is invariably accompanied by the appearance of new ones.* ***From this the rate of evolution can be estimated by the ratio N/T ~ 1-3 species per year.***

As best I can tell, the author of that passage was working strictly from observed instances of speciation and extinction, without any regard to evolutionary theory. If the author was indeed calculating the speciation rate on the basis of evolutionary theory, you’re gonna have to explain it to me.

&gt; Also what's wrong with the way I calculated speciation rate?

Since *I* didn't say *anything* about ""the way [you] calculated speciation rate"", I can only recommend that you address this question to someone who actually *did* criticize ""the way [you] calculated speciation rate"".",1,1510390476,2017-11-11 03:54:36
363,"Evidence against the Flood? Okay, let's look at the order in which fossils appear in the fossil record. At first glance, it might seem as though a truly *global* Flood would deposit dead carcasses at random through the fossil record, such that there should be *no* order whatsoever—pretty much *any* fossil should be equally likely to be found in pretty much *any* stratum. This is not what we see; instead, we see that particular fossil specimens are only found in particular strata.

The standard YEC 'explanation' for the actual, observed, order of fossils invokes three principles.

One: Hydrodynamic sorting. Some body forms are more streamlined than others, and more-streamlined forms would be expected to sink faster than less-streamlined forms.

Two: Ecological zonation. Life-forms exist across a wide variety of altitudes, and critters that live at *lower* altitudes would be expected to be found lower-down in the fossil record than critters that live at *higher* altitudes.

Three: Differential escape. Not all life-forms are equally capable of escaping onrushing Flood-waters; the more-mobile critters would be expected to be found higher up in the fossil record than less-mobile critters.

These three principles do not work well. As a concrete counter-example, consider sea turtles. Hydrodynamic sorting: Sea turtles are pretty streamlined, so hydrodynamic sorting says they should be found towards the bottom of the fossil record. Ecological zonation: Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the ocean, and you can't decently *get* much lower than that, so ecological zonation says they should be found towards the bottom of the fossil record. Differential escape: Sea turtles are not noted for their ability to move out of the way of floodwaters—they're pretty darned slow—so differential escape says that sea turtles should be found towards the bottom of the fossil record.

Alas for YECism, sea turtles don't show up in the fossil record until the Jurassic period, which is distinctly closer to the *top* of the fossil record than the bottom.

Also: According to the three YEC principles, dolphins and plesiosaurs should be found in the same strata. They aren't. Pterodactyls and albatrosses are not found in the same strata, even though the three YEC principles say that they should be found in the same strata. And let's not forget plants; mangroves are found no deeper than Cretacious strata, about 114 million years ago, which is a great deal higher up in the fossil record than the remains of allosaurs have ever been found. Apparently, mangrove trees (found at sea level, rooted to their respective spots) were better able to escape the onrushing Floodwaters than allosaurs..?

Another problem that plant fossils present to the three YEC principles, hydrodynamic sorting in particular, is *pollen*. Very small particles tend to sink through water at rates *inversely* proportional to their size—so if YECism is true, fossilized pollen grains should *not* be found in the same strata as fossils of the plants which originally produced those pollen grains. Rather, fossilized pollen should be sorted by size, from the largest grains on the bottom-most strata to the smallest grains on the top-most strata.",1,1510383891,2017-11-11 02:04:51

You better try to sum up what doesn't refute the Flood caboodle.

Here are [some 60 problems with the biblical Flood](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html). Each single of them are fatal to the story.

It doesn't even mention some other problems. Like the fact that there are human genes that have up to 6000 alleles. The combined genome of the human population after the Flood (Noah, his wife, sons and their wives) implies no more than 10 alleles max for any gene. The 4,500 years since then comprise some 220 generations. How on earth could 220 generations produce such an extensive 6,000 alleles for some genes? This presupposes an evolutionary pace by all means entirely impossible according to all genetic laws.

And:

Because there were no plants - plants won't survive being immersed in meters of salt water for months (let alone kilometers): that will stop fotosynthesis due to a lack of sunlight and makes respiration impossible. So what exactly did the herbivores eat after the flood? How did the plants resurrect themseves BTW?

And: 

What exactly did the carnivores eat? Because every instant they ate something, another species went extinct on the spot because of all prey animals only two members were living in the aftermath of the flood: the single male and single female who made it to the ark. Eating any one of those and that species died out instantly.

And the [website of Oldearth ministries](http://www.oldearth.org/), especially the entries on Noah's arc, geology and the Grand Canyon that per geological evidence just make minced meat out of the Flood story.

385,"&gt; Bring a prediction, because since evolution is false, it can't make predictions. I'm going to cite one of those posts where biologists were able to predict where a fossil was. Help finding it?

Here's an *EXTREMELY* small list out of the hundreds of thoudands predictions made by evolution theory, just choose one at your will:

- Darwin predicted that precursors to the trilobite would be found in pre-Silurian rocks. He was correct: they were subsequently found, they already are abundant in the Cambrian and precursors even have been found in the pre-Cambrian.

- Darwin predicted that Precambrian fossils would be found. He found the total absence of fossils in Precambrian rock ""inexplicable"" (the famous ""Cambrian explosion""). When such fossils were found, starting in 1953, it turned out that they had been abundant all along. They were just so small that it took a microscope to see them.

&gt; There are two kinds of whales: those with teeth, and those that strain microscopic food out of seawater with baleen. It was predicted that a transitional whale must have once existed, which had both teeth and baleen. Such a fossil has since been found.

&gt; Evolution predicts that we will find fossil series. And we do (see my previous post with the Wikipadia list).

&gt; Evolution predicts that the fossil record will show different populations of creatures at different times. For example, it predicts we will never find fossils of trilobites with fossils of dinosaurs, since their geological time-lines don't overlap. 

&gt; Evolution predicts that animals on distant islands will appear closely related to animals on the closest mainland, and that the older and more distant the island, the more distant the relationship.

&gt; Evolution predicts that features of living things will fit a hierarchical arrangement of relatedness. For example, arthropods all have chitinous exoskeleton, hemocoel, and jointed legs. Insects have all these plus head-thorax-abdomen body plan and 6 legs. Flies have all that plus two wings and halteres. Calypterate flies have all that plus a certain style of antennae, wing veins, and sutures on the face and back. You will never find the distinguishing features of calypterate flies on a non-fly, much less on a non-insect or non-arthropod.

&gt; Evolution predicts that simple, valuable features will evolve independently  repeatedly (convergent evolution), and that when they do, they will most likely have differences not relevant to function. For example, the eyes of molluscs, arthropods, and vertebrates are extremely different, and ears can appear on any of at least ten different locations on different insects.

&gt; In 1837, it was reported that during a pig's fetal development, part of the incipient jawbone detaches and becomes the little bones of the middle ear. After Evolution was invented, it was predicted that there would be a transitional fossil, of a reptile with a spare jaw joint right near its ear. A whole series of such fossils has since been found - the cynodont therapsids.

&gt; It was predicted that humans must have an intermaxillary bone, since other mammals do. The adult human skull consists of bones that have fused together, so you can't tell one way or the other in an adult. An examination of human embryonic development showed that an intermaxillary bone is one of the things that fuses to become your upper jaw.

&gt; From my junk DNA example I predict that three specific DNA patterns will be found at 9 specific places in the genome of white-tailed deer, but none of the three patterns will be found anywhere in the spider monkey genome.

&gt; In 1861, the first Archaeopteryx fossil was found. It was clearly a primitive bird with reptilian features. But, the fossil's head was very badly preserved. In 1872 Ichthyornis and Hesperornis were found. Both were clearly seabirds, but to everyone's astonishment, both had teeth. It was predicted that if we found a better-preserved Archaeopteryx, it too would have teeth. In 1877, a second Archaeopteryx was found, and the prediction turned out to be correct.

&gt; Almost all animals make Vitamin C inside their bodies. It was predicted that humans are descended from creatures that could do this, and that we had lost this ability. (There was a loss-of-function mutation, which didn't matter because our high-fruit diet was rich in Vitamin C). When human DNA was studied, scientists found a gene which is just like the Vitamin C gene in dogs and cats. However, our copy has been turned off.

&gt; Darwin wrote: ""If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection."" This challenge has not been met. In the ensuing 140 years, no such thing has ever been found. Plants give away nectar and fruit, but they get something in return. 

&gt; Darwin pointed out that the Madagascar Star orchid has a spur 30 centimeters (about a foot) long, with a puddle of nectar at the bottom. Creatures that drink it must rub against the top of the spur. So, Darwin concluded that the spur had evolved its length as an arms race. So, he predicted in 1862 that Madagascar must have some insect species with a tongue just slightly shorter than 30 cm. For detailed reasons he also prodicted it must be a moth. The creature that pollinated that orchid was not learned until 1902, forty years later. It was indeed a moth, and it had a 25 cm tongue. And in 1988 it was proven that moth-pollinated short-spurred orchids did set less seed than long ones, which is the evolutionary reason Darwin came up with to explain the orchyd part of the arms race.

&gt; A thousand years ago, just about every remote island on the planet had a species of flightless bird. Evolution explains this by saying that flying creatures are particularly able to establish themselves on remote islands. Some birds, living in a safe place where there is no need to make sudden escapes, will take the opportunity to give up on flying. Hence, Evolution predicts that each flightless bird species arose on the island that it was found on. So, Evolution predicts that no two islands would have the same species of flightless bird. Now that all the world's islands have been visited, we know that this was a correct prediction.

&gt; The ""same"" protein in two related species is usually slightly different. A protein is made from a sequence of amino acids, and the two species have slightly different sequences. We can measure the sequences of many species, and cladistics has a mathematical procedure which tells us if these many sequences imply one common ancestral sequence. Evolution predicts that these species are all descended from a common ancestral species, and that the ancestral species used the ancestral sequence. This has been demonstrated for pancreatic ribonuclease in ruminants. (cows, sheep, goats, deer and giraffes are ruminants). Measurements were made on various ruminants. An ancestral sequence was computed, and protein molecules with that sequence were manufactured. When sequences are chosen at random, we usually wind up with a useless goo. However, the manufactured molecules were biologically active substances. Furthermore, they did exactly what a pancreatic ribonuclease is supposed to do - namely, digest ribonucleic acids.

&gt; An animal's bones contain oxygen atoms from the water it drank while growing. And, fresh water and salt water can be told apart by their slightly different mixture of oxygen isotopes. (This is because fresh water comes from water that evaporated out of the ocean. Lighter atoms evaporate more easily than heavy ones do, so fresh water has fewer of the heavy atoms). Therefore, it should be possible to analyze an aquatic creature's bones, and tell whether it grew up in fresh water or in the ocean. This has been done, and it worked. We can distinguish the bones of river dolphins from the bones of killer whales. Now for the prediction. We have fossils of various early whales. Since whales are mammals, evolution predicts that they evolved from land animals. And, the very earliest of those whales would have lived in fresh water, while they were evolving their aquatic skills. Therefore, the oxygen isotope ratios in their fossils should be like the isotope ratios in modern river dolphins. It's been measured, and the prediction was correct. The two oldest species in the fossil record - Pakicetus and Ambulocetus - lived in fresh water. Rodhocetus, Basilosaurus and the others all lived in salt water.

388,"&gt; Show the best fossils providing proof for evolution. Ten to twenty, although I'm sure he'll shift the goalposts. I'm planning to look stuff up on rationalwiki. 

I do not even need a whole series of transitional fossils to provide decisive evidence for evolution. I need only *one*: Dorudon. Dorudon and also another later, extinct cetacean, Basilosaur, have [fully developed hind limbs, attached to a pelvis]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Durodon_pelvis.jpg) and, [another specimen]( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7072/7282107938_e31856d35f_b.jpg) (both linked examples are of the species Dorudon atrox).

Those hind limbs were still fully developed according to basic amniote anatomy. Amniotes, meaning ""membrane surrounding the fetus"", are a clade of tetrapod (""four footed"") vertebrates comprising the reptiles, birds, and mammals that lay their eggs on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother, which is made possible by the membrane - the anamniotes like fish and amphibians don't have such a membrane and need to lay their eggs in water. Amniotes can lay their eggs on the dry land which enlarges their habitats greatly.

The typical amniote hind leg anatomy is:

- femur including patella

- fibula and tibia

- tarsals and metatarsals

- digits

- neatly attached to a pelvis.

But pesky those hind limbs were indeed:

- first of all, they were extremely small for such rather large animal (Dorudon was ~ 5 meters tall and weighted up to some 2 tons). The size of Dorudon’s hind limbs was about a modern housecat’s ones. I don’t think an animal that long and heavy could have walked with such small hind limbs

- but, moreover, the pelvis was detached from its spinal cord. You just can’t walk with hind limbs detached from the spinal cord

- also much of the ankle bones and carpals were fused as well, again making walking impossible.

Now the next, profound question here is: what was a *full-blown marine* animal doing with *fully developed, amniote type of* hind limbs which were *detached from the spinal cord* and *too small* for such a large animal and *whose ankle bones and carpals were fused*, making walking entirely impossible. In other words, what was a fully marine animals, that used front flippers and a tail fluke for propelling, doing with hind limbs in the first place but also ones it couldn’t walk with?

Well, it's because those hind limbs are vestiges and point out to the terrestial origine of cetaceans. 

But if Bruce insists on sequences of transitional fossils (he needs to because he won't be able to address the Dorudon hind limbs so he needs an escape route), there are at least 24 evolutinary transitions having a completely sufficient fossil record (according to all relevant scientific standards). For that see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils).

Beware of all (irrelevant) creationist tricks:

- ""we need to show the fossils of all thousands of steps between an ancestor and its descendant"". Well, we don't. We don't need to have documents of all subsequent generations of speakers to prove that Modern English comes from old Anglo-Saxon. If you have Cædmon's Hymn (~658-80), Beowulf (~925), Canterbury Tales (~1400), King Lear (1605-6), anmd random documents from the 18th and 20th century will greatly do.

- ""you can't prove that particular ancient species if the ancestor of the extant species"". Well we don't need to. Paleontology is not about reconstructing the geneological lineage of a species but about the consistent change of traits that lead to the observed traits in that extant species. For instance, a typical trait of humans is their skull volume. We have a perfect sequence of fossils throughout time that show a gradual increase of skull volume but of some of those transitional species we do not even know for sure it was our ancestor. The latter would be nice and interesitng to know of course but is not necessary to determine whther that ancient species show the transition of skull volume.

&amp;nbsp;

Response:

&amp;nbsp;

First of all, that's not a paper. That's a blog post pretending to be a paper. Jeanson can make-believe he's doing science, but what he's actually doing is manipulating other people's data and calling it science. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, oh my f'in goodness. The D-loop doesn't have a constant mutation rate across lineages! It's completely inappropriate for molecular clock analysis. 

I knew there'd be an error here. I didn't think it would be *that* obvious. 

In [one of the links](http://www.evolutionpages.com/Mitochondrial%20Eve.htm) I posted earlier, the authors explained clearly and in some detail why you have to *exclude* the D-loop from molecular clock calculations. 

&amp;nbsp;

You also can't pool data from multiple studies like that. Different techniques, different times, different populations. Completely unacceptable. 

To give you an analogy, in my own work, I evaluated error catastrophe in viruses. If I set up different populations at different days over a month, and then stopped them after different amounts of time, and measured the mutations differently, but then pooled all the results together to get an average mutation rate, I'd be laughed out of the room. 

But that's what Jeanson does here. It's embarrassing, really. He's just cherry-picking data and putting it together in seemingly arbitrary combinations until he gets it to look like he wants. He's pulled this trick before. It's a go-to move when one never does their own work, but instead makes a career out of misrepresenting the work of others. 

He's a straight-up fraud. ",1,1510290026,2017-11-10 00:00:26

396,"&gt;I'm going to disregard what you said and repeat the same thing I've said before as though it will be correct this time. 

Seriously. The earlier Crotty work doesn't address the shortcoming I indicated; it shows that ribavirin is a mutagen, and that treatment with ribavirin decreases infectivity. But ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue, which means it could mess with a ton of different cellular processes in addition to causing mutations.

To give you an idea of how important this point is, when I did my Ph.D. work on this *exact* topic, I specifically picked a mutagen that *wasn't* a nucleoside analogue, because had I used the former, I would not have been able to to convince anyone that there wasn't some *other* mechanisms messing with viral infectivity. 

And you know what? Crotty et al. had the same problem back in '00, which is why they followed up with the work you've previously cited. Except there, under different conditions (that isolated mutations as the mechanism), they couldn't induce error catastrophe, instead needing to expose viruses to so much mutagen they were killed *in a single generation*. 

Which means you're 0 for 2 with Crotty's work. 

Don't get me wrong, it's good, solid work. It very strongly informed the work I did in grad school. I just doesn't show what you want it to show. ",1,1510285745,2017-11-09 22:49:05
397,"Hey, sorry I didn't get back sooner.  Still having health issues but I'm definitely better than I was.  Thanks for your good wishes.

&gt; Did they show that deleterious mutations accumulate over generations?

The authors did in their [previous paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11100123).  Table 2 shows that after 4 days, poliovirus treated with ribavirin had its population reduced from 2x10\^9 to 9x10\^8 accompanied by a 480% increase in mutations. After four days, 1000 µM ribavirin reduced the viral population to only 60.  This study did not technically show the viral population reaching zero, they followed it to theh point of ""0.00001%"" of its starting size, so that seems difficult to contest.  The authors concluded that ribavirin does indeed cause error catastrophe.

The paper we were discussing above was the author's follow-up showing that ribavirin's mechanism was through mutations and not something else.

&gt; humans are right now experiencing error catastrophe, when we haven't even demonstrated it in viruses?

Given an equal number of harmful mutations per generation, a human is much more likely to be on a path to error catastrophe than a virus, even though that path will take much longer in a large genome like ours with lots of our redundancy.  I feel like we've [been through this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dn70umq/), but these are the reasons why viruses should be much better at avoiding error catastrophe:

1.  They make dozens to hundreds of copies of themselves.  If their average mutation rate is 3 and they make 100 copies of themselves, then on average 5 of them will have 0 mutations.  You can calculate this with [Stat Trek's Poisson calculator](http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/poisson.aspx) with 0 and 3 in the first two inputs.  This will of course vary depending on the type of replication a virus uses, but you get the principle.

2.  Selection is much stronger in RNA viruses because they have around 300 thousand times fewer nucleotides than a mammal and therefore each mutation will have on average a much larger selection coefficient.

3.  A larger total population in RNA viruses makes selection more easily able to act upon mutations with small selection coefficients.

4.  And because their whole genomes are many times smaller than the distance between recombination points in a mammal genome, causing good and bad mutations to much more easily hitchhike together in mammals.",1,1510269087,2017-11-09 18:11:27
398,"It's their excuse for why fossils are not all mixed up. From what I've read from AiG and other places (including the Ark Park), they believe the main mechanism by which the flood sorted fossils is by progressive burial of preflood habitats. 

In essence this would sort things by elevation of their habitat. First bottom dweller marine life, then fish, then animals on the coast, and so on. The idea has many issues, such as: 

1. Why are the ecological zones, which should have been ordered progressively more inland, buried *on top* of each other? Are we really supposed to believe the flood could rip up entire communities, then lay them down on top of each other, with no mixing of them? (See here: https://thenaturalhistorian.com/2016/10/20/wyoming-fossils-coming-to-grips-with-the-absurdity-of-the-flood-geology-model-of-fossil-origins/) 

2. Why are whales and marine reptiles never found buried together? Both of these would have shared the same pre-flood environment (shallow marine). Even assuming modern whales didn't exist until later, fossil ones like dorudon must have. These are never found in the same layers, ever. And even if we grant some ""God made them not live in the same spots"" excuse, they should still be in layers that correlate to before the K/T boundary. But they haven't. Ever.  And the distribution of whale fossils makes *no* sense if they were buried by the flood. (See Duff's most recent post here: https://www.facebook.com/Naturalis-Historia-179325738815535/) 

3. It wouldn't apply to animals who could escape easily like birds, at least not nearly as much. So why are pterosaurs and birds not found together in higher layers?

403,"Hmmm interesting that Bologna Detection Kit. Let's apply it to creationism:

- Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”

Apart from the bible: no independent confirmation.

Evolution theory has multiple lines of independent evidence: fossil record, biogeograpgy, genetics, biochemistry, comparative anatomy, evidence of selection, evidence of speciation.

- Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.

Never happens in creationism, erat demonstrandum the echo chamber.

In biology, paleontology, genetics and other scientific disciplines related to evolution, there is abundant and lively debate from different points of view.

- Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.

Creationists ought to listen to the elderly and ministers and shut up for the rest.

- Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.

In creationismn there's only one hypothesis and the rest is not even taken into consideration.

- Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.

No further comment needed.

- Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.

Nothing in creationsim is quantified. The ""concepts"" used are not even making quantification possible.

- If there’s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.

In creationism not even one link works this way.

- Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.

That's actually not a good representation of Occam's razor. Occam's razor, *non sunt multiplicanda entia praeter necessitatem*, is implying that new principles should not be invoked when existing principles already provide an explanation. If, however, the simpler explanation does not cover all the details, then additional ""entities"" are necessary. 

Evolution perfectly well explains all relevant observations, creationism doesn't. For instance, evolution explains the vestigial hind limbs in ancient whale species like Dorudon and Basilosaur. Tiny, housecat's sized hind limbs fastened to a pelvis that is distached from the spine, yet all are anatomically intact. Creation can't explain those. Or the recurrent pharingual nerve. Creation can't explain it. But evolution does. So off with creationism when applying Occam's razor.

- Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.

None of the hypotheses of creationism are falsifiable. As a matter of fact, they do not even pass as as hypotheses. Evolution is extremely well falsifiable. Otherwise look at the numerous creationist websites that are filled to the brom with attempts to falsify it.",1,1510261405,2017-11-09 16:03:25

420,"[Here's a quick sketch illustrating this with a couple of generations.](https://i.imgur.com/gkbXf9j.png) The idea is that a very small number of mutations will accumulate per generation because most of the mutations that occur will not get passed on. 

So if we were to sketch this out over thousands of generations rather than three, where did all the mutations we observe have to happen? They had to happen in the germline tissues. Or else they wouldn't get passed on. 

So if we look at very divergent populations, like African and Native American, those differences that have accumulated in each lineage have to be due to germline mutations. They *cannot* be due to somatic mutations, since those don't get passed on. And that allows us to calculate the time since those two populations shared a common ancestor. 

&amp;nbsp;

The trick that Jeanson pulls is he take data from just two generations, parent and child, and attributes *all* of the variation between them to germline mutations. That's *crazy*. He's sweeping up germline and somatic mutations in the data he uses, and then attributes them all to germline mutations, which inflates his calculations. It's an error so blatant that I have to believe he's being dishonest. ",1,1510200203,2017-11-08 23:03:23

I think he's saying ""But what if the mtDNA differences we measured came from mutations in somatic cells,"" so he's essentially saying how do we *know* the differences we measured were from the germline specifically. 

I don't feel your response really responded to that point, though maybe I just missed it. How do we know the differences were germline (which Jeanson obviously accepts)? Do we measured the mtDNA differences in germ cells specifically? Forgive me if I missed your point here, I'm just curious as to how we actually know what we're measuring.

424,"He doesn't get into anything remotely relevant until part iii, which I'll break down bit by bit:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The author tries to explain away my published mutation rate by invoking three possible scenarios under which my actual mutation rate would drop.

&gt;The first scenario envisions a movement from heteroplasmy to homoplasmy; the author thinks this is not a mutation. For the sake of argument, let’s grant the author this conclusion. But now let’s take it to it’s logical conclusion. Ask: Where did the heteroplasmic mutations come from? The only possible answer is mutation. Therefore, perhaps we should look at changes in heteroplasmic mutations, rather than changes in homoplasmic. If you look at the same table from the Ding study, you will find that the rate of heteroplasmic changes is 4x higher than the homoplasmic ones–which makes the problems for evolution even worse. So this argument doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. (In fact, sticking to homoplasmic mutations is the most scientifically conservative approach to this question, for reasons that get into significant technical depth.)

Jeanson here handwaves away the objection by saying ""this is complicated, I'm an expect, don't worry about it."" He doesn't actually address the objection, which is that you cannot tell whether any single mutation appeared in the germline or not when doing a pedigree survey, i.e. sampling parents and children. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The second scenario and third scenarios invoke a similar principle–that I scored somatic mutations rather than germline ones. In theory, this could be a valid objection. But, again, let’s take it to it’s logical conclusion. For example, the author of the blog took for granted that number of mitochondrial DNA differences among the different people groups. But how many of these have been validated as germline changes and not somatic ones? For example, the author has no problem with my citation of 123 differences being the max difference between two humans–but how does the blog author know that these differences are germline ones? 

That last question is the lynchpin, and unless Jeanson really skimped on his classes, he knows the answer. If you take an individual from a native African population, and and individual from, for example, and indigenous South American population, the only connection those individuals have is through the germlines of their ancestors back to a common ancestor. With the exception of the relatively few mutation that will occur de novo in the two surveyed individuals, all of the variation is due to mutations occurring in germline tissue and inherited in their respective lineages. That's why that number (123 differences) sets the *maximum* rate. It may be lower (in which case the time to a common ancestor is *longer*), but it cannot be higher. 

Again, I want to emphasize that Jeanson either does know this and is lying about it, or *should* know it but doesn't, and is dishonestly pretending to be an expert in a field of which he is woefully ignorant in spite of his credentials. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Furthermore, the evolutionary mitochondrial Eve and out-of-Africa model is founded on the assumption that mitochondrial differences among ethnic groups are germline. Should this be questioned now as well? If the author of the blog is not careful, he will soon undermine the entire mitochondrial DNA field!

With this last bit he's just blowing smoke. Do the differences in widely disparate populations have to be due to germline mutations? Duh. Nobody's passing on mitochondria from their somatic cells. 

Like I said, these errors are embarrassing for an ""expert."" Purdom and Jeanson should be pariahs, but a Ph.D. and willingness to lie can go a long way in creationist circles. ",1,1510190171,2017-11-08 20:16:11

430,"&gt; It's a broad and somewhat personal question so feel free not to answer if you don't want to.

I don't live in the USA where you should be cautious not to shout out you're an atheist, so I have no problem explaining it to you.

Here are some of the arguments:

- the bible is full of nonsense about the origin of the cosmos, world and life. So *hopefully* for god it was not written by him.

- not only does the bible contain nonsense but, especially the OT is a deeply immoral book which condones misogyny, slavery, genocide, violence, infanticide, directly ordered by the god of Israel.

- so to me the bible is nothing more than the very next, random bronze age mythology book among other such mythologies (Rig Veda, Upanishads, I Ching, Gilgamesh Epic etc.). Frankly, there are mythologies that are much more interesting to read, like the Greek mythology.

- If you had been born before 863 in Russia, you would believe the old Slavonic supreme gods Rog and Svarog or any of the other, lower deities in the former Slavonic pantheon. When you were born in Iran before the Islamic conquest, you would have been a Zoroastrian. After the Islamic conquest you believe in Allah.
Born in India, you either would be a Hinduist or a Buddhist. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera (to be repeated ad finitum).

- The PARTICULAR ""eternal truth"" you are believing apparently depends on the particular spot you were born and in the particular era.

- The whole of language you talk, the arguments you use and the mindset are the very same when discussing a Muslim. If you leave away ""Jesus"" or ""Allah"", you hardly can tell the difference. The same claims in the same type of words and with the same kind of reasoning.

- If I would be a perfect Christian without any sin, I inevitably STILL go to hell - the Muslim one, due to still being an infidel in the face of Allah. Or any other hell of some other random religion. And if by splendid and delightful Benevolence by His Almighty Allah I was granted to leave the Muslim hell after 3 trillion years of service (be praised His Righteousness), I yet would be claimed by any other god to nonetheless serve my punishment in HIS hell. After thousands of Benevolences (that many religions mankind came up with) and quadrillions of years in numerous hells I would at last be reincarnated as a miserable bug - the Hinduist punishment for not fulfilling one's karma. And the whole caboodle starts all over again.

- If you are a believer, you *actually* are an infidel like me because you don't believe in any of the other few thousands of gods mankind came up with. The only difference between you and me is I just disbelieve ONE more.

- You should Bart Ehrman's *Lost Christianities. The Battle for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew*. along with his *Lost Scriptures*. It contains the English translations of no less than 47 gospels and other canons of faith which have been considered as leading and authoritative as the now so trusted canon of the New Testament. In the first 3 centuries Christianity knew a variation and diversity in convictions, principles and theology that dwarfs the current differentiation in protestantism, catholicism and orthodoxy. We had Christinans in those days who believed in 2 or 3 gods (the Holy Trinity is how the church ""solved"" this problem) but also ones who thought there were no less than 35 or even 365 gods. Just as in hte old days of pantheism. There were Christians who conceive Christ as a normal human being (but still a remarkable and gifted person) while others thought he is god himself descended from heaven. And of course both human and godly ghost combined. Somewhere in the 4th century the Church wiped away many of those variants, mostly violently, and since then we have ""the Bible"".

- Everything that can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

- Lack of belief in unsubstantiated claims does not require belief that the evidence is lacking. 

- Why is god not just showing up: ""here I am, I am your creator and hark what I have to tell you"". Well because if god shows up, it will make faith obsolete. But that's exactly why god is not showing up. Because he needs faith so badly. If you know what I mean.

- In other words, i want to base my life on *real* things that can be demonstrated in any reasonable way. I don't want to base my life on ghost stories and fairy tales from some random semi-nomadic tribe dwelling the deserts of the Middle East some 3000 years ago.

Yeah and the witers of the old Bronze Age book as well - ~3000 years ago. In other words, get with the times indeed. today in biology evolution rules.

&gt; The core of science is hypothesis, experiment, and synthesis. Because of experiment, the facts of reality as we understand them are constantly changing, which means the theories of the 19th Century simply don't fit with the observations of the 21st Century.

Now what about the 3000 years old story of Genesis. The idea alone that the earth must be only 6000 years old has been disastrously falsified by at least 100 different lines of observational evidence.

&gt; However, that doesn't stop evolutionists from claiming that they still believe in evolution, no matter how complex life turns out to be.

However, that doesn't stop creationists to believe 3000 years old stories that have been distroyed beyond any recognition.

This in great contrast to biologists who have established the modern theory of evolution to be the very core of their scientific discipline.

&gt; As far as theories go, you need to have a specific enough theory that it can be falsified.

""Kind"", ""6 days"" (in the creation story), ""god"" are extremely vague concepts that have 1000 meanings depending on the invidual taste.

The irony of the fact that creationists are still trying to character assassinate the guy. 

&gt;his theories were all wrong, and we have evidence Darwin never dreamed possible. 

Natural selection remains a proven aspect of biology and yes, we have evidence he never would have dreamed of...that went on to confirm that he was overall right. While evolution (and biology itself) have been greatly expanded upon since Darwin, the guy's no more wrong than Newton was about physics despite Einstein's expansion or Galileo was about the Earth moving despite all we've learned about astrophysics since. 

&gt;Stop believing in wrong theories, and start doing science.

If irony could kill, he would not have even been able to post his comment on account of his heart literally exploding inside his chest. 

&gt;As far as theories go, you need to have a specific enough theory that it can be falsified. ""Variation"", ""heritability"", ""competition"" are awfully vague terms, and can mean contradictory things. 

Variation: differences between one thing and another. In this case, differences in certain traits within a species such as beak size or fur color. 

Heritability: Traits that are passed on from a progeny to the next generation. Including the size of one's beak or fur color. 

Competition: When two or more individuals are attempting to get something that is unobtainable by both at the same time such as competing for food or shelter. 

None of these terms are vague and there's plenty of examples of them within biology. You're just begging the point that they're vague because you don't like the idea that these things have been indisputably demonstrated to be aspects of biology. 

The examples he listed are poor straw men. He knows just as well as anyone else when people are talking about variation in biology, they're not discussing the differences between people and fish yet he posts that crap as if it's a slam dunk against evolution. It's actually really really pathetic. 

&gt;Give me a specific theory, and let's start doing science. Continue to preach mythology, and I'll use my religion to combat it.

2,"&gt; Well, I have more trouble accepting macro evolution as a real phenomena without any post-zygotic barriers we know about. Otherwise, when using God of the gaps of course, it's easier for me to conclude that micro evolution is a trait given by God (assuming there is one of course, and that species stay the same (species = animals that can breed with succes) even after millions of years. In other words, that post-zygotic barriers are static, not dynamic. 

You don't need post-zygotic barriers as evidence for macro-evolution. The fossil record suffices greatly:

- the geological formations below our feet show many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer was a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ribbles and buried dune structures indicate a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you might see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a sea floor again, ending up in shallow sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture whereever you start to dig.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that it contains fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial and algal mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ). Whole classes of species that are living today are lacking in the older formations and there is, literally, not a single specimen to be found that breaks this rule.

- there are also very clearly different instances of mass extinction observable. the most severe one was the Permian-Triassic maas extinction event, when ~90% of all species still found in Permain layers are missing in Triassic strata. But a few million years later in the Triassic, biovidersity regained with thousands of new species not spotted in the Permian strata.

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: life forms changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla and kingdoms of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. Biodiversity changed greatly many times up to the level of kingdoms.

So you don't need genetics as such to prove for macro-evolution.

&gt; In other words, that post-zygotic barriers are static, not dynamic. 

Pre-zygotic barriers often can be pretty static as well.

Moreover, macro-evolution is micro-evolution on the long run. They represent the very same mechanisms but macro-evolution occurs when micro-evolutionary changes accumulated beyond the species' boundaries (in sexually reproducing species marked by the occurence of genetic isolation). Evolutionary change is driven by genetic mutations and natural selection. Natural selection changes species as long as environmental change lasts. And genetic change will *always* happen and environmental change, when it happens, will continue to drive natural selection as long as it lasts. Moreover, there is not a single mechanism known to geneticists that would halt this change just before the point genetic isolation kicks in. And when there are no such mechanisms, the species' boundaries *will* be crossed, inevitably.

Add this to the abovementioned observations on the fossil record and the picture gets clear and undeniable.

&gt; With no direct evidence for dynamic post-zygotic barriers, I see no reason to assume that all the transitional fossils are related in such a way, that there are transitions between 'species'. I could also assume that those are all species that look like each other, living in the same area, and that some simply died and others continued their lineage. 

The transitional fossils ARE *not* related this way! They DO NOT form lineages. And, they don't need to in order to make a point for evolution! The fossil record is not about recontructing ""geneological"" lineages between a putative ancestral species and its later descendant(s). The evolutionary evidence from the fossil record is about *the transition in traits*. Let's provide an example.

When you think that all land vertebrate tetrapods (""with four limbs"") evolved from fish, you must find a fossil with mixed traits of both fish and the most primitive land vertebrate tetrapods, the amphibians. And indeed Shubin found one, Tiktaalik, which is really the transitional fossil we were looking for: it had still undeniable fishy traits but also clear features that are only found in amphibians and even ""in between"", ""fishapod"" stuff. But was Tiktaalik on the actual direct lineage from bony fish to land tetrapods? No it didn't happen to be so and it doesn't matter. It wasn't because they later found foot prints of very primitive tetrapods in Poland that predated Tiktaalik. So, apparently, Tiktaalik was on a side-line, a critter that still retained older features of its own ancestors back in time that also gave rise to the actual lineage of early tetrapods (like the one that made those foot prints).

In the meantime we also found many other fossils on the fish &gt; tetrapod transition. Nobody knows whether one of those was an actual ""fishapod"" ancestor of the first amphibians and frankly nobody cares in paleontology because for purpose of providing evidence for such envolutionary transitions it suffice greatly to prove for the transition *in traits* in a chronologically concordant fashion. In paleontology we look for fossils with the predicted traits in the right timeframe.

3,"I don't think you can say that Darwin got things wrong as much as you hardly can say that Newton was ""wrong"". Newton's laws of motion, momentum and gravitation were found to be wrong when trying to explain the orbit of Mercury around the sun. Later physicists found that Newton's laws were altogether wrong in all instances of very strong gravitational fields (like the sun and Mercury from due to the sun's mass and their very close distance). So Newton's laws only applied in weak gravitational fields. Einstein's relativity theory describes the motion and gravitational effects well both in weak and strong gravitational fields (although in itself it also has some restrictive problems). So you could say that Newtron's laws now are a subset of Einstein's theory and you can even mutate from Newton's equations to those of Einstein with basic mathematics.

Likewise, Darwin's theory of natural selection as driving force of evolution only applies when the environmental conditions are changing. Species can only survive when they adapt to these changing living conditions. But when the environment doesn't change much, we often still observe evolutionary change. That's because we now know there's also such a thing as genetic drift: the change in the frequency of existing gene variants (alleles) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.

6,"I can give you the short version:

Darwin didn't know about genes. He called them ""heritable factors"". Mendell figured out how genes work, in general (though he missed a lot of stuff), in the 1860s. 

Darwin didn't know about chromosomes or DNA. Thomas Hunt Morgan figured out chromosomes in the early 20th century, but it wasn't demonstrated conclusively that DNA was the molecular of heredity until Hershey and Chase in 1952.

But even then, we didn't know how DNA operated at the molecular level, so it took Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, Watson, and Crick to figure out the double helix structure (1953), Chargoff the base pairing rules (late 1940s), and Meselson and Stahl figuring out replication (1958) to explain how inheritance actually works. 

And Darwin only really talked about selection. Neutral theory wasn't really a thing until Motoo Kimura published on the topic in 1968, and even then wasn't a well established field until he published ""The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution"" in 1983. 

More recently than even that, we now have genomics and epigenetics, which have given us a much more realistic understanding of the complexities of genome organization and regulation. 

So basically, Darwin got the big picture right, and he's a great writer, so on those grounds alone he's worth reading, but there's a LOT he just didn't know about that the time that's really important now. So read him, then read other stuff. ",25,1506356217,2017-09-25 12:16:57

10,"&gt; Why shocking? Ring species merely is an extra bonus in the endless lines of evidence for evolution. It is a nice one because we could catch out speciation happening in vivo.

Well, I have more trouble accepting macro evolution as a real phenomena without any post-zygotic barriers we know about. Otherwise, when using God of the gaps of course, it's easier for me to conclude that micro evolution is a trait given by God (assuming there is one of course, and that species stay the same (species = animals that can breed with succes) even after millions of years. In other words, that  post-zygotic barriers are static, not dynamic. 

With no direct evidence for dynamic post-zygotic barriers, I see no reason to assume that all the transitional fossils are related in such a way, that there are transitions between 'species'. I could also assume that those are all species that look like each other, living in the same area, and that some simply died and others continued their lineage. 

Ring species used to kind of glue together the whole micro-macro evolution story for me. 

Maybe I'm wrong for making these assumptions? Is there something I don't know about evolution yet, that would convince me macro evolution is indeed happening just as micro evolution is?

Edit 1: How about this? Seems like postzygotic speciation evidence, or not? https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-5-3 

Edit 2: How do we call the problems that occur when a cat and a dog try to breed? That would probably be post zygotic right? Now what if in a lab, they still let them breed together. Would there be no baby or an unhealthy baby?

If I understand it right, we only have real life examples of pre-zygotic barriers (change in singing, appearance, so no recognizion for pairing although they would biological be able too) and actually no real life examples of post-zygotic barriers (non biological breeding possible), right?

Well not unequivocal examples of ring species but blurred. 

Why shocking? I used to apply the ring species argument easily previously but in science you always follow where the evidence leads to so now I have more to explain and be more cautious to use the argument in its simple way. 

&gt; The only way we know post-zygotic barriers can develop within species is by extrapolating with help of other evidence for evolution, right?

Ring species merely is an extra bonus in the endless lines of evidence for evolution. It is a nice one because we could catch out speciation happening in vivo.

&gt; Or are there any observed animals that had the 'breed definition' of a specie (they could breed), whereafter the ancestors weren't able to breed anymore because of too much adaption/evolution?

When we apply the pre-zygotic part of defining genetic isolation we have numeroud examples. And there is really nothing wrong with pre-zygotic barriers. When *for any reason* subpops do not interbreed anymore, there is no gene flow between both of them and that will accelerate genetic divergence. The same happens when people who speak the same language will part due to migration. After a few centuries, they speak already quite different languages. But in the homeland people tend to speak the same language because there's still constant exchange of (new) words and grammar. If there is contact and direct exchange, things tend to stay more stable and not diverge. As soon the populations are separated, diverging kicks in.",2,1506345623,2017-09-25 09:20:23
12,"Well for someone who had such an idiotic response, it sure did seem to get to you. 

I never asked for links proving the uniqueness of humans. In fact you asked me to expand on my claim that humans are unique, and I gave you an answer grounded in the latest science as well as common sense. Your links did not disprove in any way the claims that I made, which you would know if you delved a little deeper into the latest studies and complexities of why our brains are so amazing. Our mortality and location in the Universe do not make us any less unique (what a terrible argument that is). 

I indeed did read both of your links. The first link demonstrated that 1. Scientists are in disagreement over how to define speciation (problem)  2. The best examples they could give of MACROevolution are plants turning into a slightly different version of plant, or the fish you mentioned. Both are terribly unsatisfactory examples of macroevolution that will not resonate with anyone who uses their own brain and doesn't dogmatically swallow whatever is sold to them under the title of ""scientists say"". In fact, they sound an awful lot like examples of microevolution that scientists are desperate to fit into the criteria of macroevolution. 

If I understand your argument correctly it goes something like this. . .""A plant changing into a new plant! A fish turning into a new fish! Bacteria that eat plastic! How could you look at that slam dunk evidence and not believe land animals evolved from sea creatures and birds evolved from dinosaurs??"" It's not super convincing, I hate to tell you. 

I think you would rather believe that this evidence is not resonating with me because I am some fundamentalist zealot with a middle school education. In fact I was raised by a science teacher who literally wears a necklace with a picture of Darwin around her neck, was NEVER taught creationism, and attended Lyceum and IB magnet programs, both of which hammered evolution into us from 6th grade on up. My biology highschool classes connected almost every lesson back to an understanding of evolution. My husband and I have been huge believers in evolution our whole lives and only recently started to question the lack of evidence for macroevolution after having it drilled into our heads throughout college. Science and common sense can work in conjunction, y'know. 

You also seem to want to nitpick the words that I use to describe macroevolution, though the terms I used are correct. Macroevolution is defined as one species changing into another species. As you said, giving rise to something new that doesn't exist. I never contested that. The best proof scientists have of macroevolution are chichlid fish evolving into other types of chichlid fish? Fruit flies with more wings than usual?? An inability to explain how humans grew the big brains that we have, making us human? Thats the best evidence?? Because yikes.  *Based on that evidence* everyone should accept that every species on earth evolved from ALGAE, or else be labeled an anti-science whackjob. Well ok. 

Many respected evolutionists such as Jay Gould admit that there is a major lack of evidence for macroevolution. I can see both sides of the coin. I can understand how someone can see the evidence for microevolution and wholeheartedly believe that macroevolution is the best explanation for how all species on earth came to be. There may one day be enough evidence for macroevolution, so that any educated layperson could easily understand it in the same way that adaptation and microevolution are clearly observable and true. But until then, a belief in macroevolution is a faith based conclusion in my opinion. ""Science"" does appear to be your religion right now, whether you admit to it or not.

13,"&gt; you tried to provide an example of kingdom-level change, which is subjective

It really isn't. What traits separate the archaeplastid supergroup, which is plants, green algae, and red algae, from the other three eukaryotic supergroups? The BIG thing is having a *primary photosynthetic plastid*. When I say primary I mean ""acquired via primary endosymbiosis,"" as opposed to secondary endosymbiosis. 

So we can point to that trait and say, objectively, the acquisition of a primary plastid is a supergroup-level change. (Also, ""supergroup"" is between domain and kingdom, hierarchically, so that should satisfy ""kingdom-level"".)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;it is not a new trait or a new gene. It just moved into a new organism.

See what you did? 

&gt;new trait or new gene

As though that's the same thing. Traits and genes are not the same. This process involves the movement of genes, but the resulting traits are completely new. The *Paulinella* genus never had photosynthesis, and never had plastids, at any point in its lineage, prior to the acquisition by *P. chromatophora*. That's a brand spankin new *trait*, and a pretty damn complex one, *that we're observing appear in the present*. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think the specific definition is the sticking point. I think the sticking point is very clear: You will never admit that *any* observed change qualifies as evidence that evolution can explain extant biodiversity. Because you hold, as a matter of faith, that it does not do so. And that's fine, but be honest about it. Don't pretend there's something out there that's going to change your mind. If rhizarians and animals becoming photosynthetic won't do it, nothing will. ",2,1506345213,2017-09-25 09:13:33

Please don't twist my words. I said that we haven't observed species diverge into two distinct kingdoms or phyla. That is, the common ancestor of kingdoms and phyla was not directly observed to give rise to these groups. And I recognize that *this observation would not be expected* because it happened over millions of years and took place billions of years ago (according to the popular model).

However, you tried to provide an example of kingdom-level change, which is subjective. This subjectivity, I think, is the cause of our misunderstandings and frustrations.

15,"Oh, yeah, there's WAY more evidence for evolution than just those too. The basic evidence of common ancestors (are you talking genetic?) and the fossil record for transitional species become hugely compelling when taken together.

- so many lines of reasoning point to exactly the same thing, that it is compelling enough to recognize it as a significant mechanism of our world rather than just a one off occurrence.

Kurt Wise? Please remove him form you list of ""honest creationists"". Wise wrote:

&gt; Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth, I am a young age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture.

WHICH [scientific reasons](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation)?

&gt; ...that the rejection of evolution does not necessarily involve the rejection of all of science.

This is *deliberately* leaving away that young earth is also rejected by: geology, genetics, physics and other major parts of science that are not related to evolution. And I call this *deliberately* because Wise holds a PhD in paleontology from Harvard University, under Stephen Gould no less. So he is perfectly well aware of the state of affairs in science.

&gt; Creation isn't a theory. The fact that God created the universe is not a theory, it's true. However, some of the details are not specifically nailed down in Scripture. Some issues such as creation, a global flood, and a young age for the earth are determined by Scripture, so they are not theories. My understanding from Scripture is that the universe is in the order of 6,000 years old. Once that has been determined by Scripture, it is a starting point that we build theories upon. It is within those boundaries that we can construct new theories.

Wise deliberately uses the colloquial definition of ""theory"" as if it were scientific. As a Ph.D. in paleontology, he ought to know what theory actually means in science and he *must* know it.

He also exhibits an attitude that directly and diametrically contradicts scientific methodology. But then he claims we still can build ""scientific"" theories on the permise the Babble is true. This is an enormous abuse of the scientific method od epic proprtions and everything BUT honest.

So what will a creationist do when he faces this obvious obviousness. Well ... change the definitions. So:

&gt; Well no. The fossil record is primarily sudden appearances followed by stasis, and the gaps increase as the taxonomic hierarchy is ascended. 

But that's about *the pace* of evolution, not about whether evolution explains this well. Punctuated equilibrium *still* is evolution, according to the ones who coined it, Eldredge and Gould.

&gt; Speciation has been observed in microbes and in more complex forms of life. However, species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

The fossil record:

- the geological formations below our feet show many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer was a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ribbles and buried dune structures indicate a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you might see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a sea floor again, ending up in shallow sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture whereever you start to dig.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that it contains fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial and algal mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ). Whole classes of species that are living today are lacking in the older formations and there is, literally, not a single specimen to be found that breaks this rule.

- there are also very clearly different instances of mass extinction observable. the most severe one was the Permian-Triassic maas extinction event, when ~90% of all species still found in Permain layers are missing in Triassic strata. But a few million years later in the Triassic, biovidersity regained with thousands of new species not spotted in the Permian strata.

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: life forms changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla and kingdoms of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. Biodiversity changed greatly many times up to the level of kingdoms.

31,"&gt; As I mentioned before, I find it hard to throughly understand it all because I have no educational basis for biology or evolution. 

Let me explain a bit with an example. In many species, male birds produce songs to attract females. Each bird species has its own song. So the female only answers the particular song of males of the same species but ignores other ones. Biologists have found that sometimes males start to sing other songs, for instance after two subpopulations of originally the same species were separated geographically for a while. So females of subpop A don't answer calls from males of subpop B. 

It's the same as with humans who talked the same language but after a few centuries of separation, groups talk different dialects and after yet some more time even different languages. We know from attests that Saxons having migrated to England in the early Middle Ages some centuries later still somehow could understand the language of the ones that were left in Holland and Northern Germany. But today those Saxons talk English and German or Dutch respectively and those have become quite different languages.

In birds this process happens much faster. But, moreover, when birds have changed their ""dialect"", they won't interbreed anymore. And when they don't interbreed, genetic isolation kicks in and technically we are talking about different species. But further research showed that genetically the genomes of both subpops are still compatible. When you artificially would fertilize a female of subpop A with sperm of a male of subpop B, this female neatly produces valid offspring. That's pre-zygotic without post-zygotic barriers. A post-zygotic barrier is when the 2 genomes are diverged to the extent that the genomes of A and B are not compatible anymore. Offspring is infertile (like mules after interbreeding donkeys with horses) or no offspring is produced at all.

&gt; Are there any real life examples of ring species which have post-zygotic barriers?

Yes but the picture is often blurred. The best way to comprehend the problems here is to read [this article](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/there-are-no-ring-species/) by genetic biologist Jerry Coyne.",1,1506316924,2017-09-25 01:22:04

  *  ""Formation of five new species of cichlid fishes which formed since they were isolated less than 4000 years ago from the parent stock, Lake Nagubago.""

Like I said, it occurs in nature.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If macroevolution existed wouldn't we see a wide spectrum of different animals that had evolved over millions of years, not seperate distinct species?

We have a wide spectrum of different animals, that are separate distinct species. Do you not understand how biology works? We have a wide variety of different groups of animals, and in those groups of animals we have a wide variety of species. It is literally what you say we should see. We see it, but for some reason you can't.

Again ""Formation of five new species of cichlid fishes which formed since they were isolated less than 4000 years ago from the parent stock, Lake Nagubago."" Hell we keep discovering new species.

Macro-evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Micro evolution, sure. There's loads of evidence. But one species changing into another distinct species that continues to flourish?? Nope. 

Again, I must ask, what the hell do you mean when you say ""one species changing into another distinct species?"" Because I have told you, evolution isn't one thing turning into something else **that already exists** it is giving rives to something new that doesn't already exist.

&gt; At the end of the day, whether or not scientists classify humans as apes, who also evolved FROM apes, and evolved alongside apes, yadda yadda, is pretty meaningless to me and I would suspect most people. 

Then you are admitting you don't care about facts or accuracy. But, from what you have posted so far that is already evident, I'm just glad you admit it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Trying to use that as ""evidence"" that humans are not unique is just pompous and flies in the face of common sense. 

Common sense is a terrible thing to trust. Despite what common sense tells us, we know time can be sped up, or slowed down. Despite what common sense tells us we know photons can be in two places at the same time. Despite what common sense tells us we know it is impossible to know both the exact location of an electron and the exact speed of that same electron. It is impossible to know both at the same time. That doesn't make sense, and yet it is a fact.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You completely lose me when you actually try to argue that humans are not unique in all the ways I described.

But I showed exactly that, we aren't unique.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Your links to animal studies prove nothing

Well, they literally proved you wrong. The opposite of what you claimed has been observed. Do you not know how proving things works?

&amp;nbsp;

By your lack of logic we should literally have to re invent the whole of science in order to advance one iota. Like every other human advancement we have, we work where other left off, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Maybe that is why you don't understand science, because just like evolution it is a incremental buildup over numerous generations.

That is why science works, and religion doesn't.

If macroevolution existed wouldn't we see a wide spectrum of different animals that had evolved over millions of years, not seperate distinct species? In the references you provide I was not able to find one example of succesful, naturally occuring macroevolution of one species changing into another. Micro evolution, sure. There's loads of evidence. But one species changing into another distinct species that continues to flourish?? Nope.  

The best ""example"" I could see given was the housefly, but even that ""evidence"" is laughable. You take the fruit fly which is very easy for geneticists to work with, so if you're going to demonstrate macroevolution with any species, it would be the fruitfly.

64,"&gt; The boundary would be between one species turning into another. Adaptation within a species is clearly observed, but we have never observed one species turning into another.

The wording of this makes it a little difficult. Evolution doesn't claim one species can turn into another species **that already exists.** Evolution doesn't say an African painted dog will evolve into a hyena or a zebra would evolve into a Clydesdale. If that is you're understanding, you have been misinformed.

&amp;nbsp;

However, one species giving rise to a new separate species? That **is** evolution, and more importantly it has happened. We have observed it both in the field(nature) and in the lab(artificial). We have [Observed Instances of Speciation](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html) and we have [Some More Observed Speciation Events ](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; There is still no concrete evidence for apes turning into humans via evolution

Apes don't turn into humans, humans ares apes. We are a subset of apes. You can't out grow or evolve out of your lineage. Humans are primates, apes are primates. This is true for the same reason we are both vertebrates, for the same reason we are both deuterostomes. All humans are apes, but not all apes are humans.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We have never observed one species turning into another, which evolutionists say is due to how long evolution takes, but to me thats still a significant lack of evidence. 

No. It has been observed. Most of the time it takes a long time or serious changes to occur, but if you are only talking about change on the species level, its already been done.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You seem to want to deny that humans are distinct and set apart, but we have many abilities that other animals do not. Language, use of tools and burying the dead are not unique to human beings, but civilization, use of symbolism and religion are.

Depends on how you define civilization. Bees, ants, termites, all live in colonies which some could argue is a primitive civilization. But none of those insects are *that* intelligent. But octopus are highly intelligent. And it seems that, in a least this one instance, [they have formed a city.](https://qz.com/1077632/octlantis-is-a-just-discovered-underwater-city-engineered-by-octopuses/)

&amp;nbsp;

Religion and symbolism, those are tougher. We can't communicate with the other species, so we really can't test that claim but:

 *  [Symbolic Communication Between Two Pigeons, Columba livia domestica](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/207/4430/543)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We humans have language skills that are unparalleled compared to other species.

Again, really difficult to test. We know [Bees Are The First Insects Found To Understand The Concept Of Zero](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/bees-are-the-first-insects-found-to-understand-the-concept-of-zero/) So being able to understand an abstract concept is amazing, I would assume they could communicate too.

  * [Rationing ravens and merciful monkeys: can animals be altruistic?](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/26/rationing-ravens-merciful-monkeys-can-animals-be-altruistic)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We write down stories... everything that makes us different is quite sad, to be honest.

&gt; The gene mutation you talk about is more along the evidence I am looking for, though I would like to see the actual evidence for that. Can you provide a link for that claim? Because I suspect that is not actually the solid ""proof"" you claim, as scientists have stated that they do not have the evidence for why our brains are so much bigger and our minds so different.

I have to make one correction, we didn't lose a tumor suppression gene, we lost a growth regulation gene, but it was *near* the tujmor suppression gene.

But I learned of another mutation, we lost some of the function of SRGAP2, which also makes it possible for us to grow larger brains.

  * [This loss of functionality appears to stop the SsrGAP2 protein working properly....More rigorous tests have revealed that by loosing functionality SsrGAP2 makes neurons create fewer branches ahead of them. Since these branches slow the neurons down as they move around the brain, this mutation would result in faster migration.

&gt; Also, whether it's a theory or a hypothesis so you understand the flaw in that hypothesis, and how do you explain it? Just the gene mutation? 

Smaller jaws and eating meat are probably related to brain size. Meat is a more dense energy and nutrition source. So we don't need a large of jaws, and it helps to fuel our brain better.

No, not assumed. Happening right now. You may think it isn't happening before *your* eyes, but that's only the case if you squeeze them shut. Like, we can watch individual *Elysia chlorotica* ingest algae, isolate the chloroplasts, and use them for months, which wouldn't be possible without HGT from the algae to the sea slug. Another species, *E. viridis*, does a similar thing, but we don't have evidence of HGT in them yet; they probably started doing it more recently. 

We also know how to find HGT. Codon bias, for example. Dead giveaway. It's really obvious when a gene is recently-acquired in a genome, and that's what we see in these cases. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So evolution by HGT cannot account for the whole of modern biodiversity.

Why is it always that a single process has to account for ""the whole of modern biodiversity""? Again and again, I've said to you and others that *all* of the mechanisms have contributed to extant biodiversity: mutation, selection, drift, gene flow (which includes HGT), and recombination.

You can't take each one on its own and be like ""well that can't account for what we see,"" and after deciding that's the case for each one, conclude ""well look at that, evolution isn't possible."" They're all operating, all the time.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Another question would be how did we humans evolve from apes in such a dramatic way, as to acquire such unique capabilities and characteristics that are not seen in any other animal.

You need to be far more specific in this claim. What capabilities and characteristics are purely human ones?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Of course when studying the bones and DNA of gorillas and humans there are many similarities, but in real life the differences are glaring.

Humans and chimps have ~98.5% identical protein coding DNA. That is the important DNA that makes your body do all the things your body does. Also, please elaborate on these alleged differences.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Humans are clearly set aside as being different from every other animal.

First, again I must demand you back that statement up with examples and evidence. Secondly, thank you for admitting humans are animals, you are a step ahead of many creationists.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The theory that I learned in anthropology class was that humans were eating a lot of fish and meat which caused our brains to grow bigger, but we know that this is not how evolution works

First of all, that is a hypothesis, not a theory. A theory explains a body of observations and evidence. Gravity, cells, evolution, and e = mc^2 are theories.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; anthropology class

There is your problem. Learn biology from biologists and biology teachers. There are two special mutations that make humans a little different from the other apes. First is a mutation that gives us a smaller jaw. We don't have the bone ridge on top of our skull to anchor large jaw muscles to, this allows for a larger skull to develop.  The second mutation is an inactivation of a brain tumor suppression gene. This makes it more like for us to develop brain cancer, but the loss of the gene also mean we grow more brain matter than our ape cousins, giving us larger more capable brains. Both of these mutations occurred around the same time, and having a more capable brain far out weighed smaller jaws and a slight increase in chances of brain cancer.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; One generation ... brain grow bigger.

Not relevant, think I already explained things.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; There is a HUGE physical leap between the digestive tract of a herbivore (ape) and ominovore (human).

&gt; The major downfall of the Ring Species concept is that the end populations, which by definition cannot interbreed, have been found to interbreed even in the wild, typically with fertile offspring. 

and:

&gt; It can also be noted that the the gene flow which is expected to continue around the ring has usually not been found. Instead, most of the groups have sharp breaks in the genetics which show distinct populations rather than gradual change. 

The first claim is not affimed by the literature the article refers to, such source is not mentioned. So it completely escapes me how to conclude this wile the literature does not mention it.

The second claim is only affirmed by two cases of ring species, the herring gull and the Australian parrots. The other ones are not even mentioned. The conclusion of the article, ""most of the groups have sharp breaks in the genetics"", makes me wonder WHAT populations of WHAT species because most of the known ring species are not even involved. Moreover, the study on the herring gull ends with the conclusion:

&gt; Contrary to the ring-species model, we find no genetic evidence for a closure of the circumpolar ring through colonization of Europe by North American herring gulls. However, closure of the ring in the opposite direction may be imminent, with lesser black-backed gulls about to colonize North America.

So let's await what happens here.

Conclusion: unallowed inference based on evidence that not justifies such.

And ***OF COURSE*** we have the ***USUAL*** strawmen, and these have consequences:

&gt; The changes that are actually observed are typically referred to as Pre-zygotic Barriers which mean characteristics used in choosing a mating partner rather than Post-zygotic Barriers whose characteristics mean successful fertilization cannot occur even when attempted because of genetic dissimilarity. 

Hola! This is classic case of unallowed narrowing of a definition to suit your deceitful business. Genetic isolation *also* happens when due to behavioral, temporal, mechanical, gametic and habitat isolation. The only definition is genetic isolation.

But all studies the article referred to genetic studies, mainly concerning mitochondrial DNA analysis. But post-zygotic genetic isolation is just *one* way of speciation.

As the herring gulls and Australian parrots were cases of genetic isolation due to pre-zygotic genetic barriers, they STILL ARE CLEAR cases of ringspecies.

For evolution to have worked in this way in relation to the ""we had access to more meat and fish"" theory, there would literally have had to be some of us who could not tolerate eating as much fish and meat and somehow died off, leaving only the ones who ate more meat. And even then that would only improve your ability to eat meat, not make your brain grow bigger.

&gt; There is a theoretical goldilocks zone where the mutation rate is juuuuuust right to cause harmful mutations to occur without killing everyone directly, and where selection is weak enough that these mutations can accumulate over time and cause extinction, but we haven't found an actual situation like this, and we haven't been able to create one experimentally.

The size of goldilocks zone is going to scale with genome size and/or organism complexity.  A small RNA virus has little-to-none redundancy.  A mammal's genome is mostly redundancy.  

Second:  When the mutation rate is lower, selection will be able to effectively remove lower selection-coefficient deleterious mutations.  That means only the even less deleterious mutations can accumulate, making the experiment take even longer.  Maybe it's the case that some RNA viruses are more prone to others with this--I don't know.

Keeping that in mind, now let's get to your main point:

&gt; The question is whether there is a concentration of mutation (and therefore a mutation rate) that will cause the viruses to accumulate deleterious mutations over time without all dying right away.

In the ribavirin case it didn't kill all of them, but it instead led to a ""99.3% loss in viral genome infectivity.""  So that sounds like they landed somewhere in the goldilocks zone.

&gt; Well, duh, mutagens are toxic.

Yes but what they did next is the important part:  they took the surviving polioviruses and tested them in a mutagen-free environment.  Here's a table that combines data from their table 3 with the middle paragraph of page 6898:


 **Ribavirin** | **Mutations per Replication** | **Viral count per microgram**
:---------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------
 0 μM          | 2.1                           | 1,500,000

The more ribavirin was used, the less they were able to replicate in the mutagen-free environment.

&gt; We can do the math on the population genetics, and there's no theoretical reason why this can't happen.

88,"Okay, so the question here is whether error catastrophe is demonstrated in this experiment. 

Error catastrophe is when mutations accumulate over many generations, eventually resulting in the average reproductive output in the population falling below the level of replacement, resulting in population extinction.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going to quote a line from the abstract, and part of a paragraph from the results. See if you can spot the problem.

From the abstract:

&gt;A 99.3% loss in viral genome infectivity is observed after **a single round** of virus infection in ribavirin concentrations sufficient to cause a 9.7-fold increase in mutagenesis.

And from the results:

&gt;In the presence of 400 mM ribavirin, there was an 18-fold reduction in genome viability (Fig. 2B, Table 2). Additionally, there was a 6-fold reduction in total genomic RNA (Fig. 2A, Table 2), which was likely due to the inactivation of many replicating viral genomes in the ribavirin-treated cells during the multiple rounds of replication and mutagenesis occurring in **a single infectious cycle**.

I've highlighted the important parts. See the issue?

&amp;nbsp;

What these authors showed is that if you hit the virus with enough mutagen, you can kill most of the population in a *single* generation. Well, duh, mutagens are toxic. That isn't the question. The question is whether there is a concentration of mutation (and therefore a mutation rate) that will cause the viruses to accumulate deleterious mutations over time *without* all dying right away. 

We can do the math on the population genetics, and there's no *theoretical* reason why this can't happen. But in practice, we tend to see one of two things: Either the population dies right away, like in the work you cite, or it tolerates the elevated mutation rate just fine, as Bull et al. reported.

&amp;nbsp;

Why does this matter for Sanford and ""genetic entropy""? Because ""genetic entropy"" is a made-up creationist term for ""error catastrophe"". The requirements are the same: Slow accumulation of fitness-decreasing mutations. This is not something we see in nature, and it's not something we've been able to induce. Either the mutation rate is too low, in which case the population does just fine (no error catastrophe), or the mutation rate is too high and everyone dies from the mutations that occur in that one generation (also no error catastrophe). 

There is a *theoretical* goldilocks zone where the mutation rate is juuuuuust right to cause harmful mutations to occur without killing everyone directly, and where selection is weak enough that these mutations can accumulate over time and cause extinction, but we haven't found an *actual* situation like this, and we haven't been able to create one experimentally.

&gt; By putting it in terms of generation, you compress many rounds of replications together and compare it with a single genome replication in other organisms.

Ugh.  We are measuring the number of mutations between each round of selection.  Yes there is also germline selection but it is insignificant because the genetic material needed to make a functioning sperm or egg cell is trivial compared to the amount needed for all the cell types doing all the functions in a human.  This is the same technique used in all the population genetics papers on this, but for some reason you insist on questioning only me when I rely on what's already widely accepted in the field.

I'm glad that you're at least open to the idea that humans are in fitness decline.  And yes, weak selection accelerates that process.

Humans have 6 billion base pairs in their diploid genomes, and many other complex animals have genomes around that size.  So yes, all of them likely also experience genetic entropy, although those with shorter generation times and more offspring are less affected.

With 100 mutations per generation, and with all the backups of genes (ploidy, additional copies, and unrelated gene networks that do the same job), it takes a long time for decline to happen.  For example [here](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions/#A-Simple-Model) I do a back-of-the-envelope calculation that if we start with a 100% functional genome where every nucleotide matters, it would take 6 million years to reach the point where 11% of our genes have both diploid copies destroyed.

The first major discovery was that stasis was much more prevalent in the fossil record than had been previously supposed. Many paleontologists came forward and pointed out that the geological literature was one vast monument to stasis, with relatively few cases where anyone had observed gradual evolution. If species didn’t appear suddenly in the fossil record and remain relatively unchanged, then biostratigraphy would never work—and yet almost two centuries of successful biostratigraphic correlations was evidence of just this kind of pattern.""

108,"My response was actually not at all that Xtians rilly rilly believe anything. I'm simply offering you a few problems with your assertions.  I'll point out a few more problems and you can re-write your reply if you please. First, not all Christians believe there was no death before the fall and therefore Adam and Even really can know what death is. These people you're attacking are young earth creationists and are not really a group I care to defend. With this being the case your point about God punishing the ignorant is a point I'm going to ignore for good reason.  

Lets go on to your point where you claim I acknowledge a problem and then drag my superfluous faith into the mixture. ""most Christians would hold to the fact that God won't tell you anything in your mind that isn't already written in the bible. "" What I said was people believe the bible. Therefore people acting in a not loving way aren't Christians and people acting in a loving way won't listen to this voice you're suggesting. So, the people that don't believe God is good, atheists - since they take this logic not to believe in this God, shouldn't listen to God at all. This leaves us with people who believe in God and listen to him to do good things, people who think they are Christians yet are not (you and I both reject these people) and people who don't listen to God as they are atheists. There's no need to make me out to be a friend to the insane.

Also, I know you rilly rilly BELIEVE morality that has evolved is best, but it's not founded on anything. It seems to be founded on survival of some species and we can't even argue this species survival is a good thing. If we're talking about the survival of life human death may actually be a great thing. This is the issue with the atheistic view of morality in the lack of ability to prove it's good. (I'm totally OK if you want to push the ""it's not supposed to be good"" approach, but if you do that, please don't talk to me about crazy people doing things in God's name...)

There are all sorts of side rants here about how if you want to argue with someone who doesn't have a good God then you shouldn't debate a Christian. If I do start to believe in a God that isn't good I'll reconsider all your points and promptly stop believing in him since he's clearly not good.

I gather from your post that you won't be happy until I recant, so with our lack of ability to please you I recommend we not debate further.

145,"&gt;Actually Darwinists are often racists, starting with Darwin himself who argued for ""Preservation of Favored Races.""

This appears to be a reference to the full title of Charles Darwin's book: *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*. To one who is content to judge a book by its title, without any regard for, like, the *content* of said book, that title may well suffice to 'prove' that Darwin was a racist. But if one goes so far as to, you know, *read* Darwin's book, one notices an omission which is rather peculiar, under the presumption that Darwin was bigoted against humans with darker skin: Search the pages as you will, and you won't find any reference to *human* races. Darwin writes of races of cabbage, and races of pigeons, but races of *humans?* Nope, not there. The concept to which Darwin applies the word ""race"" would, in current discourse, be expressed by the term ""variety"", or perhaps ""subspecies"". 

&gt;He and other white Darwinists after him thought dark skinned people were closer to apes than white skinned people.

It is true that some people who accept that the theory of evolution is valid, also have racist beliefs. It is far from clear that the former is in any way a causative factor for the latter, and if one wishes to argue that acceptance of evolution *does* somehow predispose one towards racist beliefs, one had damn well better offer a more substantial argument than a *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. Consider that many *Christians* have racist beliefs; racist Christians are a group that includes, but is *far* from limited to, the devout, upstanding, God-fearing Christians who believed it was God's Divine Will that Whites own Black slaves, and founded the Southern Baptist Church because of that belief.

&gt;
&gt;Yes, I think the lack of ability to distinguish is a problem.

I'm glad you acknowledge that it's a problem. Do you have a solution for this problem?

&gt;Two thoughts on the matter though, most Christians would hold to the fact that God won't tell you anything in your mind that isn't already written in the bible.

Just to make sure we're on the same page (so to speak): This is the same Bible in which it is written that this God person explicitly states that It ""creates evil"" (Isaiah 45:7), that this God person imposed a death sentence on two people who had no idea what 'death' even *is* (assuming the standard Xtian no-death-before-the-Fall notion applies) for an offense they committed while they literally *did not have any knowledge of good and evil* (Genesis 2:17), and that God had to cheat in order to beat a human in a wrestling match (Genesis 32:25), right?

Before you respond to the above, consider two points. First: Religious belief is decidedly off-topic here. Second: Xtian morality is no more consistent/unified/monolithic than is Creationism, so if you want to argue the 'inherent superiority' of Xtian morality, you *will* have to either (a) defend horribly immoral positions that absolutely *are* (or at least *were*) bog-standard Xtian teachings, or else (b) explain how come *all those other guys* got God all wrong, but *you* got It right. Neither of those positions strikes me as one *I'd* like to be in… but, eh, you do you.

&gt;Secondly isn't this the exact argument Christians use against atheists in noting that ""morality"" might ""evolve"" differently if it had another chance, so why listen to the voice in your head/heart/whatever body part?

No. You seem to be thinking that these unnamed atheists were arguing that morality is nonsense; in my experience, atheists are no more likely than anyone else to argue *that* proposition. I suspect those unnamed atheists were *actually* arguing against the notion that morality has a single, unified Divine source, *not* that morality is nonsense. I can understand how someone who mainlines the Xtian kool-aid might misinterpret *no unified, Divine source of morality* as *no morality whatsoever*… but that *is* a misinterpretation, mm'kay?

&gt;In short I don't understand how you could say theistic evolutionists are doing science wrong. It seems you're saying they take it to inferences that aren't necessary, which is a different mistake than error in the science.

Look at you: When faced with the question *how can you* ***tell*** *whether a voice-in-the-head* ***really is*** *a message from God?*, you went straight to *B-b-but we Xtians* ***rilly, rilly BELIEVE*** *that God is good, honest we do!* Okay, fine, I already knew that you Xtians believe this God person is the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, *and* all that + a bag of chips.

So friggin' what?

Your (literally) dogmatic religious commitment to the belief that God Is Good has *nothing whatsoever* to do with the practical, operational question of *how can you tell the difference between a brain malfunction and the Real, Genuine, Accept-No-Substitutes Voice Of God™*. You *did* manage to acknowledge that ""the lack of ability to distinguish is a problem"", and good for you. But *you didn't stop there*. You *immediately* dragged your superfluous god-belief into the discussion, in a gratuitous display of Xtian Faith.

There are some Xtians who can and do manage to keep their Xtian beliefs safely compartmentalized away where said beliefs won't do any harm, when those Xtians are doing science. And then there are Xtians who just can't resist the temptation to ram their God down into the deepest depths of *every* available orifice, at *every* opportunity which presents itself to them, *regardless* of how appropriate or otherwise that ramming might be.

It seems to me that Creationists, as a group, have a disproportionately high percentage of the latter sort of Xtians.",1,1506066638,2017-09-22 03:50:38
148,"&gt;Thanks for the great question.

Yes, it *is* a great question, and thanks for noticing. The question makes it perfectly clear that Current Lack Of 'Natural' Explanation For Event X *is* ***not*** *sufficient grounds on which to conclude that Event X is supernatural*.

&gt;First of all, there appears to be to connection between these two events (am I right?), so they would be examined entirely independently. To the scientific investigator, neither, either, or both could be natural or supernatural.

[shrug] Alright. The only commonality *I* had in mind between Event X and Y was that they both share a Current Lack Of 'Natural' Explanation, but I don't see how it makes any real difference to specify that Events X and Y are not connected in any way, so whatever.

&gt;Second, I would point out that wrong explanations are given for events all the time. The nature of the Scientific Method is not deductive (inferring a particular result from a general premise), but rather inductive (inferring a general conclusion from a set of particular premises). As such, the Scientific Method is actually faulty logic and can provide erroneous conclusions. For example, I can examine a thousand horses and observe that all of them are brown; from this I can scientifically, but erroneously, conclude that all horses are brown. To handle this problem, we say that all scientific conclusions are tentative (subject to error and subsequent revision upon examination of further data).

I agree with this observation; scientific conclusions *are* tentative, and if there ever were a properly scientific conclusion that some event was 'supernatural', that scientific conclusion would be tentative, as well.

I also note that acknowledging the tentative nature of scientific conclusions does *not*, in fact, come within a country mile of answering my ""great"" question. That question, just to remind you, is: * How can we tell whether Event X or Event Y is genuinely supernatural?*

&gt;Nevertheless, you are probably thinking that there exists no evidence that would warrant a supernatural explanation.

Incorrect. What I *actually* think is that the word 'supernatural' has no coherent meaning—that the word 'supernatural' refers to an ill-formed, inchoate notion which is so bleedin' *vague* that it the term ""supernatural explanation"" is just as nonsensical an oxymoron as ""married bachelor"".

No doubt you disagree with me on this point. That's fine. If you care to pony up a definition of ""supernatural"" which is sufficiently well-defined that it *does* make sense to speak of a ""supernatural explanation"", I'm all ears (figuratively speaking).

&gt;That is simply not true. If you think that, you have been operating under the BDMNP for so long that you have lost all ability to discern supernatural agency.

I cannot say whether or not I have indeed ""been operating under the BDMNP"", as I have no idea what the initialism ""BDMNP"" means. ""MNP"" *might* stand for ""Methodological Naturalism Principle"", but even then, what's the ""BD"" stand for?

&gt;Here are a couple examples where a supernatural cause would be warranted:
&gt;The cause (if there is one) of the Big Bang.

Hold it. The Big Bang is certainly a good example of an event for which there is not *currently* any 'natural' explanation, yes. But as I've noted above, *Current Lack Of 'Natural' Explanation* ***is not*** *sufficient grounds on which to conclude that Event X is supernatural!* So if you're concluding that the Big Bang was 'supernatural', you obviously must have *some* evidence *other than* its Current Lack Of 'Natural' Explanation. Do you?

&gt;If the Big Bang is uncaused, i.e., the universe and all time-space simply spontaneously came into existence, it would violate our most fundamental notions of causation — it would be the only assumed uncaused event.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't ""our most fundamental notions of causation"" kind of assume, up front, the existence of Time, of some sort of progression from Past to Present to Future? If ""our most fundamental notions of causation"" are, indeed, dependent on Time, it follows that ""our most fundamental notions of causation"" *cannot* apply to any scenario in which TIme is absent.

Can you demonstrate that ""our most fundamental notions of causation"" *are not* dependent on the presence of Time?

In at least some formulations of Big Bang, Time isn't a thing until *after* the Bang, um, *Bangs*.  Can you demonstrate that Time actually was a thing *before the Big Bang happened?*

And apart from anything else, I am still waiting for you to answer my question, which you described as ""great"": * How can we tell whether Event X or Event Y is genuinely supernatural?*

&gt;However, if it has a cause, it is necessarily supernatural (or more properly, extra-natural). So, if we assign it a cause (as most scientists/philosophers do), it must be a supernatural cause. Both the Many Worlds Theory and the God Theory are supernatural, and science cannot speak to the correct option (but philosophy may).

That's nice. It also isn't an answer to my ""great"" question—*How can we tell whether Event X or Event Y is genuinely supernatural?*—but it's nice.

&gt;The Intelligent Design (ID) Theory. Whether you subscribe to it or not (I do; you probably don't), it claims to provide a methodology for identifying intelligent causation.

I agree that ID ***claims*** to ""provide a methodology for identifying intelligent causation"", yes. Sadly, all such claims I know of are unfounded. Dembski's Explanatory Filter is more indicative of the Filter-user's ignorance than of the Design-status of whatever it's being used on, for instance.

Still awaiting your answer to my question: *How can we tell whether Event X or Event Y is genuinely supernatural?*

&gt;Flavors of ID are routinely used to identify human causation…

I call bullshit.

Those fields of science which *do* ""identify human causation"" *do not and* ***cannot*** *be dependent on any product of the contemporary ID movement*, because they all make use of tools and techniques which *vastly predate the advent of that movement*. Said fields of science identify Design by forming hypotheses regarding the Manufacture of whatever-it-is, and then *testing* those hypotheses. Metaphorically, you might say that real science identifies Design by looking for the 'tooth-marks' of the 'saws' which 'cut into' the 'wood'.

What did ID bring to the Design-detection table? The notion that Design could be detected ***without*** *any knowledge of Manufacture—indeed, without* ***any historical knowledge whatsoever*** *of the development of the Designed-entity-in-question*. If this notion were true, or even practically valid, it would be way-cool… but alas, this notion has proved to be scientifically barren.

Still awaiting your answer to my question: *How can we tell whether Event X or Event Y is genuinely supernatural?* Seeing as how, you know, you haven't yet come within a country megaparsec of *answering* my question.

&gt;…and are accepted in forensic analysis, anthropology, cryptography, and the search for alien intelligence.

Forensic analysis *et al* all make use of putative 'flavors of ID"" which *do not* make use of the Explanatory Filter, nor of Dembski's version of 'specified complexity, nor any other alleged Design-detection tool that the ID movement has yet managed to disgorge. This being the case, 

&gt;However, some phenomena seem to exhibit ID, but, like the big bang, cannot possibly have a natural cause.

Hold it. How do you *know* that Big Bang ""cannot possibly have a natural cause""? You're not arguing that Current Lack Of 'Natural' Explanation is a valid reason to conclude It's Supernatural, are you?

151,"I'm sure *some* Creationists definitely *are* racist. YEC George MacReady Price, one of the seminal figures of the modern Creationist movement, wrote this 'charming' bit of doggerel:

&gt;*His skin grew black, as the fierce sun beat*

&gt;*And scorched his hair with its tropic heat,*

160,"&gt;Darwin was completely wrong

Darwin was one guy who worked over a hundred years ago on biology. His scope was far more limited than what's available today and he lacked some of the bigger evidences for evolution that we know now. The fact that he (and Wallace) were able to figure out all of this in of itself is pretty incredible despite their disadvantage. Just because creationists believe literally everything people thousands of years ago said doesn't mean scientists do to. 

Science has since moved on from his days. While he understood that life all emerged from a common ancestor, his ability to create a 'tree of life' based on it was sorely limited because all he had to go by was physical appearances. 

The funny thing is, the article itself isn't saying that evolution is wrong, only that the analogy of a tree of life is too simplistic to account for what we know today. It's like if a geocentrist posted an article about how circular orbits don't work saying ""AHA! Take that, Earth movers!"" and it turns out the article was describing how elliptical orbits better account for the movement of planets. ",4,1506031804,2017-09-21 18:10:04
161,"&gt;Note that I qualified that the winner bought a single ticket in each lottery, rather than buying every ticket they could find:

I know, that's why I claimed that you were assuming independence. That's fine as an example on it's own, and I agree that such a situation would be extremely suspicious. My issue is with using this as an analogy for inferring design: all it really suggests is that your model for estimating the likelihood of the observation is wrong.

To bring the analogy back to biology, I agree that the spontaneous formation of a (proto)cell or large organic macromolecules is unlikely to the point of impossibility. But this does necessarily imply design, it only means that the generating model is almost certainly not a series of independent events. This obviously the case, because nature follows various patterns that make certain outcomes more likely than others, and feedback loops can make certain outcomes almost guaranteed. This the whole point of abiogenesis research, we're trying to find the initial conditions and understand the physical and chemical dynamics that resulted in the formation of life.

The probability of an interstellar cloud of  hydrogen gas spontaneously arranging into a configuration that enables fusion and creates a star is effectively zero, but we see stars. Should we assume that stars must be designed? My position is that we only can infer that our model is wrong: the position of each hydrogen atom is not an independent, uniformly sampled random variable. That each atom was meticulously put into position to form each star by a designer is one possible alternative, but the existence and effects of gravity is a makes such a designer unnecessary.

&gt;You're right that ID Theory assigns a cause to the anomalous statistical event. But in the appropriate circumstances, we routinely do so as well.

Only when the evidence suggests such an outcome.

&gt; In a murder trial, the identification of evidence of intelligent agency will, depending on the context, implicate or exonerate the suspect.

We go with the best supported model, as always.

&gt;And who would drive by Mount Rushmore without attempting to identify the author?  Similarly with the Easter Island sculptures (although we still have not identified the sculptors).

The likeness of these objects to ourselves is strong evidence that it was humans that created them. For all we know, we could be surrounded by similar works produced by alien life that are completely unrecognizable to us.

This is a big issue I have with design theories, you must assume or know something about the designer. Otherwise designs may be impossible to identify.

&gt;Those constrained by the BDMNP also search for a cause. In the case of the universe's amazing fine tuning, BDMNP adherents strain for an explanation, and must satisfy themselves with the Multiverse Hypothesis (which is untestable, unfalsifiable and every bit as supernatural as an appeal to God, but has no moral baggage). 

We search for explanations of patterns that enable us to understand, predict, and/or exploit our environment. We *choose* to constrain ourselves in this way because we care about utility and gathering useful and verifiable knowledge.

When a paramedic calls in to the hospital from the ambulance to report on the patient's situation, the first data he provides is: (1) the patient's age, (2) the patient's race, and (3) the patient's sex, like this:

&gt; ""I have a 22 year-old white female...""",-1,1506015788,2017-09-21 13:43:08

187,"&gt; ""If a person reinvested their lottery winnings back into the lottery in the form of buying every lottery ticket they can find, their chances of winning multiple times would go up.""

Note that I qualified that the winner bought a single ticket in each lottery, rather than buying every ticket they could find:

&gt; ""And you'd really get suspicious if the same woman won the same lottery again the very next week, **after purchasing a single ticket**.""

You're right that ID Theory assigns a cause to the anomalous statistical event. But in the appropriate circumstances, we routinely do so as well. In a murder trial, the identification of evidence of intelligent agency will, depending on the context, implicate or exonerate the suspect. And who would drive by Mount Rushmore without attempting to identify the author? Similarly with the Easter Island sculptures (although we still have not identified the sculptors).

Those constrained by the BDMNP also search for a cause. In the case of the universe's amazing fine tuning, BDMNP adherents strain for an explanation, and must satisfy themselves with the Multiverse Hypothesis (which is untestable, unfalsifiable and every bit as supernatural as an appeal to God, but has no moral baggage).",1,1506014916,2017-09-21 13:28:36

189,"For those interested, these are Luther's recommendations about how to treat Jews (extract from Luther's treatise ""On the Jews and their lies"" - 1543, translated from German):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies. This will bring home to them the fact that they are not masters in our country, as they boast, but that they are living in exile and in captivity, as they incessantly wail and lament about us before God.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside, since they are not lords, officials, tradesmen, or the like. Let them stay at home.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping. The reason for such a measure is that, as said above, they have no other means of earning a livelihood than usury, and by it they have stolen and robbed from us all they possess.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam (Gen. 3 [:19]). For it is not fitting that they should let us accursed Goyim toil in the sweat of our faces while they, the holy people, idle away their time behind the stove, feasting and farting, and on top of all, boasting blasphemously of their lordship over the Christians by means of our sweat. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants.

200,"I'd rather not get sucked into this discussion, but I think that it's worth mentioning that your definition of information assumes that all events are independent.

If a person reinvested their lottery winnings back into the lottery in the form of buying every lottery ticket they can find, their chances of winning multiple times would go up. If the dynamics of the system encourage certain outcomes and discourage others, these kind of calculations can significantly overestimate the amount of information necessary to describe something.

Consequently, that's why this approach is useful for detecting fabricated noise.  Noise is often expected to be independent.

ID did not invent this kind of analysis, however. This is just simple probability and statistics. You assume a model of your data (independent, normally distributed samples white noise), measure the likelihood of the the observed data under your model, and then compare that to the expected likelihood of data generated by your model. If there are big differences, it means your model is probably ~~wrong~~ not the generating model for the observed data.

But here is where ID diverges from the approach that science takes. Science just notes that the model is a bad fit, and tries to find a better model. ID makes the jump to conclude *intent* behind the data. They both recognize a pattern, but science doesn't care where that pattern comes from or *who* generated it, we just want to know what it is.

This is also how these techniques are/could be used in the other domains you brought up. We know or assume a model of the usual and/or anomalous  dynamics of the system, compute or estimate the likelihood of the evidence under possible models models, and then go with the model that best explains the evidence (weighted by the prior of course, this is essentially Bayesian analysis at this point).

As an example, imagine a victim of sexual assault that a suspect is uncannily familiar. For two people uniformly sampled from the population, this is unusual and could be indicative of a stalking situation or extensive planning on behalf of the suspect. And then the defense provides records that show the suspect was a postal worker that delivered mail to the victim's neighborhood. This reasonably explains the victim's sense of familiarity with the suspect as an expected result.

ID is not the first to discover pattern recognition. It's just the first to claim that all or at least some patterns are designs. Many of us here question the utility of such a claim. What exactly does it provide us with that focusing purely on understanding the patterns does not? We observe many patterns in the universe that can be described as interaction of simpler patterns, and the success of such an approach suggests that we should place a high prior on these kinds of models. ID instead places a high prior on the design explanation for certain patterns, which is unjustified given that we have exactly one instance of a known designer.",1,1505969894,2017-09-21 00:58:14

My readings, highly dumbed down, suggest that they found a marker for a gene group on the island that is also found on the mainland. However, the carriers of that gene group were not similar to the mainland carrier, suggesting that the marker arose a second time.

224,"Not the OP, but I can provide some examples:

   1. All the inputs and outputs to the brain have to cross over to the opposite side. So inputs from the right side of the body cross over to the left side of the brain and vice versus. Same with outputs.  Except for what becomes cranial nerve 4, which crosses over twice.
   2. All the fibers traveling from one side of the brain to other have to squeeze through a narrow section, the corpus callosum, forcing related areas of the brain to travel a much further distance to communicate than they really need to. It isn't necessary to divide the brain to this extent, not even all mammals are structured this way.
   3. The visual cortex is in the back of the brain, as far as possible from the eyes. This increases the distance traveled and thus decreases reaction time.  By comparison the auditory cortex is right near our ears, but that doesn't actually help because the fibers have to travel to the opposite side of the brain anyway.
   4. The 6-layered neocortex is overly complicated and appears to be a historical accident. Birds have similar levels of brain ability as mammals but only have 5 layers.  They have the same cells types, they just don't need to divide them up as much as we do.
   5. The eye (developmentally part of the brain) is installed backwards, leading to a huge variety of problems.
   6. Our eyes develop right out of brain tissue, unlike the rest of our senses.
   7. There is wide variation in where and how senses are processed. Most visual processing happens in the neocortex, while most olfactory processing happens in the more primitive alocortex, while probably about half of auditory processing happens in the most primitive areas the brain stem and midbrain.
   8. Most senses pass through nerves to a central processing and comparison structure called the thalamus, except smell where the receptors go right into the brain through a bunch of small holes in the skull.  This is despite the fact that our eyes develop directly from brain tissue while our nasal receptors don't, and despite the fact that vision and hearing are much more important to rapid response to danger than smell is.
   9. The nerves exiting the brain are a huge mess. For example there are nerves that connect to dozens of muscles and others that only connect to one. Some connect to multiple senses, others to only one. Closely-related muscles can be innervated by unrelated nerves exiting from a completely different part of the brain.",3,1505938881,2017-09-20 16:21:21

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ota_Benga

&gt;Ota Benga (c. 1883[1] – March 20, 1916) was a Congolese man, a Mbuti pygmy known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri in 1904, and in a human zoo exhibit in 1906 at the Bronx Zoo. Benga had been purchased from African slave traders by the explorer Samuel Phillips Verner, a businessman hunting African people for the Exposition.[2] He traveled with Verner to the United States. At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in Virginia, for the rest of his life.

234,"Finding ""soft tissue"" is highly blurring wording. Mostly the research involves the very laborious extraction of *proteins* out of the already mostly mineralized tissue.

I don't think this part of Scheitzer's research is at stake. In other instances also ""soft tissue"" has been retrieved from ancient fossils: [here](http://www.history.com/news/scientists-find-soft-tissue-in-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-bones), [here](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0131/How-a-195-million-year-old-dinosaur-bone-could-still-have-soft-tissue-in-it) and [here](http://westerndigs.org/americas-most-complete-armored-dinosaur-soft-tissues-intact-found-in-montana/) and [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028195) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3831950/). And Schweitzer herself confirmed a second find by her team concerning a hadrosaur.

So that part of the research on ""soft tissue"" seems to be pretty much establishing itself. There have been other researchers struggling to extract peptides from ancient fossils but that doesn't falsify the cases where it has been, especially when these concern other specimens than the ones Schweitzer used. If these studies were about the same specimen of Schweitzer, I would agree with your red flag.

But there is a spinoff of Schweitzer's research: could the molecular sequences of ancient protein be used to establish phylogenetc relationships. This research was done by Asara et.al (including Schweitzer). For instance, does the collagen of the T. rex specimen found by Schweitzer confirm that dinosaurs are indeed closest relatives to birds (and not mammals or reptiles). And the results of the one study on this matter has now been challenged. It seems that the results could well [be due to mixing up with modern materials and statistical flaws](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5892/1040.2.full?rss=1).

So it seems that this research has to be done again in order to establish the phylogenetic relationship between dinosaurs and extant birds and is yet indecisive.

238,"&gt; In this case, they discovered his experimental outputs were fully simulated, produced from a function. You could do that by running line of best fit on his data and then finding no error rate.

I think you are typing without having any idea what happened in the Schön case, and without any idea what ID Theory says.

In the Schön case, Wikipedia says (and as I already quoted above):

&gt; Lydia Sohn, then of Princeton University, noticed that two experiments carried out at very different temperatures had **identical noise**.

It was not the data points that got Schön in trouble. He was smart enough that he could falsify the data, complete with experimental error. It was the **background noise** that convicted him. He copied the same background noise into multiple graphs that supposedly were raw data taken at separate times. All the graphs had the same background noise. Background noise that has a certain threshold of data points (500 bits' worth) will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever repeat. So if you see two graphs with 500 bits or more worth of background noise, and the noise is identical, you *know* that the noise was ""designed"", i.e., not randomly generated or correlated by chance.

Do you see that? That is ID Theory in action, whether or not the investigators intentionally implemented it (I doubt that they did). ID Theory is so commonsense that you and I routinely implement it without even knowing it. ID Theory quantifies your intuitive hunch.

Think of a lottery player that wins the lottery, against a million-to-one odds. There is nothing special about that — someone has to win it. But you'd get suspicious if that winner just happened to be the lifelong BFF of the Games Commissioner — in fact, it's his live-in girlfriend. And you'd *really* get suspicious if the same woman won the same lottery again the very next week, after purchasing a single ticket. Well, winning the lottery at a million-to-one odds represents 10^(-6) = 2^(-20) probability, which contains 20 bits of information. In order to satisfy the strict requirements of ID Theory of 500 bits of information, that same woman would have to win the lottery 25 times in succession (20 * 25 = 500), after purchasing a single ticket each time! I know that you and everyone else would be certain that this was not a mere random happenstance on the first or second round. But 25 rounds?? ID Theory sets a high bar indeed for detection of intelligent interference.

By the way, there is another possibility in the above scenario, and that is that the lottery effectively had a flawed random number generator, and the lottery results were not random. ID Theory handles that possibility as well.

I would feel more like we could have a productive discussion if I knew that you had some familiarity with the principles of ID Theory, and were not simply parroting the criticism of others (who don't understand ID Theory, either). You don't have to accept it to understand what ID Theorists claim.

Like, you're not even using the right words for things. You're saying mutations, but you're describing substitutions. Do you understand the difference, and why it matters? 

&amp;nbsp;

Like, here's why your wrong. I want to preface this by saying this is pretty basic evolutionary biology. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, you don't seem to care that we describe mutation rate in terms of mutations/site/replication, rather than per generation. How many replications per viral generation? One. How many per human generation? A lot more than One. But what's the rate of replications? Faster in humans or viruses? See the problem? By putting it in terms of generation, you compress many rounds of replications together and compare it with a single genome replication in other organisms. Makes no sense. 

Same with substitutions. It's changes/site/*year*, not generation. So on a per generation basis, humans accumulate about 100 substitutions. But that takes 20 years, on the low end, or about 5 subs/year, absolute maximum. An RNA virus population that replicates even once per day (slow for RNA viruses) is going to accumulate a ton more substitutions in that same time period.

Which means we would *absolutely* expect those RNA viruses to be experiencing error catastrophe over time, if the mutation rate was high enough. But we don't, so it isn't. Which means the notion of error catastrophe in the human genome is laughable.   

And that's not including the enormous population size compared to humans and other mammals. And it's not including the importance of genome density - &gt;90% sequence specificity in the small, dense viral genomes that are almost entirely functional vs. &lt;10% in human genomes that are 10-20% functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

Is this all new to you? Or do you just not care? I mean, it's genuinely surprising just how precisely you're able to be wrong. You pick the *exact wrong way* to measure mutation and substitution rates, which also happens to be the way that allows you to portray the data in such a way that would make non-experts think it supports your argument. I don't think you know the ins and outs of this stuff well enough to be that specific in your wrongness, but whomever you get these talking points from sure does, and you should know they're feeding your bullshit.

263,"&gt; The reason for the redshift is because of the universe itself expanding. This stretches out the light, increasing its wavelength. It isn't the same as the classical Doppler shift.

I know and I really also wanted to mention that the universe itself is expanding but that's not the way to fare with layman as I experienced earlier. So I tried to bring it back to understandable analogies. On an earlier instance it ended up in people (virtually) running away because the whole time/space fabric itself expanding is just beyond normal comprehensibility.

&gt; That is also not correct. A photon of light of a lower frequency has less energy than a corresponding photon of light of a higher frequency. So a photon of red light has less energy that a photon of blue light.

If you paid well attention that was not the thing at hand here. The OP's claim was the other way round.

&gt; Also not correct. Some galaxies are moving relative to each other, independent of the overall expansion of the universe. Some galaxies orbit other galaxies, some galaxies collide (the Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with us). The universe is a messy place, so of course there is variation on their movement and this does alter the redshift (or blueshift, in the case of the Andromeda galaxy) due to the Doppler effect.

But that also wasn't at stake here. OP was referring to galaxies that were thought to be approximate relative to each other, *without* orbiting each other, nor belonging to a local group like the Milky way and Andromeda or on collision course but still appeared to have a completely different red shift. I only forgot that case. It caused a lot of fuzz in the world of astronomy and of course creationists were preying on it.

So we will see that object as it appeared in the past, whenever that light was actually emitted or reflected toward us. The object is still very old but we will see the object in as it was when it was young.

Some galaxies are very, very far away. They will look young to us, since we are seeing them as they were long ago the past. A galaxy that is 10 billion light years away will appear to us as it was 10 billion years ago.

My guess is that it was a matter of chance. They were clouds of gas and dust that have been relatively undisturbed for pretty much their entire life.  However, relatively recently something, such as a close pass with another galaxy or rogue black hole, destabilized them and leading to the gas and dust they contain to start collapsing under its own gravity into stars.

He had several plots of data that included background noise, and the noise was identical in multiple graphs. If the background noise data points comprise more than the threshold of 500 bits of information, it is impossible for random data to match. As such, it was determined that the random data was ""designed"": he fudged the data. He was dismissed and his promising career ended.

Wikipedia states:

&gt;Lydia Sohn, then of Princeton University, noticed that two experiments carried out at very different temperatures had identical noise. When the editors of Nature pointed this out to Schön, he claimed to have accidentally submitted the same graph twice. Paul McEuen of Cornell University then found the same noise in a paper describing a third experiment. More research by McEuen, Sohn, and other physicists uncovered a number of examples of duplicate data in Schön's work. This triggered a series of reactions that quickly led Lucent Technologies (which ran Bell Labs) to start a formal investigation.

296,"Redshit is the same when an ambulance paases by: when it approaches the pitch of the siren is higher than when it distances. The same with light: when a galaxy approaches the earth its light shifts a bit to the blue spectrum of colors, when it distances itsd colour shifts to the red sid eof the spectrum - hence blueshift and redshift. The more redshift, the greater the speed of distancing. 

When we observe the light of galaxies, we see that the farther away a galaxy, the greater the redshift. This corresponds to a spherical structure expanding. But if you reverse a sphere expanding, trying to reconstruct wheere it zame from, you finally will end up in its center. So physicists and astronomers reversed the process and tried to figure out what happened. What they came up with was the big bang model. 

This model rewinded the process of the *observed* cosmic expansion, using the current models of physics (gravitation, atom model, relativity theory of Einstein, quantum mechanics, etc.). So, scientists thought what would happen by using the established models and how far can we get. Well we can go back as far as a fraction of second after the moment the expansion started and the model still remains within the current physical framework. Beyond that horizon (called the Planck epoch), the current laws of physics fall apart and we just can't tell what happened because to tell we need those physical laws to make sense.

So when asked what caused the cosmic inflation to start and what was before, scientists will tell the moment inself most likely would be quantum fluctuation but for the rest they will answer ""we don't know"". When scientists do elaborate about what happened during the Planck epoch, they will immediately say it is a guess, an educated guess perhaps but stil just guessing.

&gt; Ignoring these ~~problems~~ gaps in our understanding, what evidence is promoted for the Big Bang?

Evidence for big bang theory: [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Observational_evidence). The next line of evidence, when the space observatories are ready and launched, coming soon: primordal gravitational waves.

&gt; Astronomy is a hot bed of evolution.

And *who* the hell provides them licenses to teach children.

&gt; The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos and immense explosion of mass-energy about 14 billion years ago. Ever since, matter has been expanding outward. Stars, galaxies, planets, and people graduallly formed from these fragments.

Grossly this is correct. At least current cosmology says the onset of the universe was a state of hot, extremely condensed energy. VERY different from creationists who mostly think god created the universe ""[ex nihilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_nihilo#Christian)"" - out of nothing but who still somehow manages to criticize *us* for thinking that the big bang implies that everything came from nothing while it explicitely does not while *actually8 main theology DOES. It is accusing someone else for your own misbehavior. That is deceit of the highest order.

Now WHAT society allows these deceivers to stand before the classes polluting the minds of children?????

&gt; Evolutionists must tread lightly over problems like:
&gt; 
&gt; *Where did the intial mass energy come from?
&gt; 
&gt; *What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

~~Evolutionists~~ Cosmologists and physicists do NOT tread lightly over these problems. AGAIN LYING. These are main subjects of current ongoing research. These problems are *gaps* in our understanding and these gaps do not falsify the current model. 

And WHERE the fuck are the creationists models. Because they have a RIDDLE of HUGE problems:

- they think that the universe was created ex nihilo - out of nothing. they have no explanation for where the initial mass energy came from EITHER

- they have no explanation of all the *observations* the big bang model has no problems with, like redshift, cosmic background radiation, abundance of primordial elements, the particular galactic distribution, primordal gas clouds, etc.

Thus, applying Ocam's razor, the creation model has to be discarded due to unnecessary redundancy.

&gt; The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

If you compare cosmic expansion with an inflating balloon, is is *quite easy* to deomstrate that ANY RANDOM spot in the balloon will disctance form any other random spot when the balloon is inflating.

&gt; As light moves away from a star its energy is lessened and thus its frequency is shifted.

As distance is shortened between you and the object, the object blue shifts because the waves are being compressed through movement and reach your eye faster. Red shifting stretches out the waves as distance is put between you and the object and causes them to reach your eye slower. No energy is gained or lost at all. All photons (=light particles) move with the speed of light whereever you obserrve them. Redshift has NOTHING to do with the energy of the moving object. Redshift and blueshift are due to object parting or approaching. In the Doppler equations (the mathemitical description of change in frequence of waves) the factor energy is not mentioned.

Now WHAT *rediculous* society permits itself to put teachers into the classe rooms who have such a poor and troubled understanding of the stuff they supposed to teach??????

&gt; Another problem Hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

299,"A lot of good answers already, but I hope to add something to it.

First of all, if you are interested, the book The Big Bang by Simon Singh is quite good. It's a very accessible history of cosmology and follows the discoveries from the start of astronomy to the more recent cosmology. I find it is always wonderful to know what we know, but also why/how we came about knowing it.

The Big Bang Theory: https://goo.gl/qG5DA7
ISBN-10: 0007152523
ISBN-13: 978-0007152520

It is important to remember that the Big Bang was not an explosion of matter and energy, but of time and space itself (since these dimension are closely tied to each other). Someone mentioned it already, there is no time before the Big Bang. So you can really say that the energy has always (as long as there has been time) been there.

Also important to know is that cosmologists can make mathematical models that agree with our measured data back to about a planck after t=0. That is from t=0 to t=0 + 1x10^-43 seconds. The reason the models break down before that is because the tools physicists use to measure things (natural laws and constants) were not fixed and separated yet. If it it impossible to distinguish gravity from the strong atomic force, for instance, it becomes very hard to measure things. It's like asking you how tall you are, but I want the answer in pounds and I give you a ruler made out of elastic.

So yeah, stuff is complicated but we know a heck of a lot more than creationists will ever let on.

A fun proof of the Big Bang is Cosmic Background Radiation. As it happens, the theory predicted that there had to be a pervasive, non-directional radiation at a specific frequency left over from the Big Bang (basically the very first photons redshifted to the extreme). 

In the 1960, two cosmologists (Penzias and Wilson) found that their antenna picked up some noise, regardless of where they pointed it. They checked every connection, even scrubbed all the pigeon poop out of the dish and it never went away. They mentioned this to some colleagues who were working on CBR and it turned out that that noise was cosmic background radiation. The theory predicted it had to be there, and by accident someone who didn't know about it, found it. I always think that is some powerful evidence.

With regards to redshift: it isn't just that most galaxies are redshifted (moving away from us), but far more revealing: that the distance and the speed have a 1:1 correlation, i.e. a galaxy that is twice as far away from us than another, will be moving twice as fast.

Distance is speed over time. If distance doubles and speed doubles, then time remains constant. This naturally gives rise to the idea that at some point everything was in the same spot.

As a closing thought: I always find it hilarious when creationists point to the biggest names in physics to somehow prove a flaw in the theory. Einstein predicted that light is affected by gravity. 
/s Really? Do tell, who is this Einstein guy and why have physicists apparently never heard of him? /s

Cosmologists really do know light is affected by gravity and account for this in their models. :-)

303,"&gt;Astronomy is a hot bed of evolution.

Wrong.  They're two completely different areas of study, one deals with stars and the other with biology.  Hell, Astronomy isn't even really the right term for what he's probably talking about, with the Big Bang theory - what he's really referring to is astrophysics.

&gt;The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos

Not even close to Big Bang cosmology.  The Universe (all matter and energy) existed in a ""hot dense state"" at the beginning of time.  The Big Bang was the expansion of the Universe, and the beginning of time.

&gt;Where did the intial mass energy come from?

It has always existed.  ""Always"" is a temporal term, and since the Big Bang was the beginning of time...  well, it should be fairly obvious.  Asking where it came from *before* time would be a nonsense question, like asking what's north of the north pole - you're referencing causality when the continuum in which causality applies doesn't exist.

&gt;What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

It's always been expanding.

&gt;The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

That's not correct - It works if we're all getting further and further away from each other.  There is no center to the Universe, it's all relative:  is there a center to infinity?  No, it's a nonsensical idea.

&gt;Another problem hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

Not a problem - one's moving away faster than the other - nobody said it has to be uniform.

&gt;I have no idea what redshift is

306,"&gt; -The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos and immense explosion of mass-energy about 14 billion years ago.

The big bang was not an explosion, and it wasn't really all that chaotic initially.  Small initial differences got amplified over time as the universe expanded.

&gt; Ever since, matter has been expanding outward.

The universe has been expanding outward, the matter has just been carried along with it. (more on this later)

&gt; But, hubble was causing trouble, further out, younger galaxies all over, are mixed with older galaxies.

Not sure what they are talking about here.

&gt; Also, light can be redened by gravity. (Einstein predicted this in 1912. Gravity can bend light.)

Yes, gravity can change the frequency of light.  But the effect is so low as to be practically undetectable, no where near strong enough to account for what we observe. 

&gt; As light moves away from a star its energy is lessened and thus its frequency is shifted.

No, this is flat-out wrong. Yes, the energy from an energy source that radiates in all directions drops as you get farther away from the source, but that is not because the frequency changes.  It gets a bit finicky due to the fact that light can act as a wave or a particle, but an easy way to think about it is that the energy of each photon stays the same (the frequency of the light), but there are fewer photons in a given area.  

Imagine a balloon. Tape little stickers to the balloon. Those are photons. Now inflate it. That is the photons moving outwards. As you inflate it, the space between the photons gets larger, but the photons themselves stay the same.

As I said, it gets a bit trickier in the details, but the basic idea is correct: the energy change is not due to a shift in frequency.  If it did radio station frequencies would change the further you are from the station, which doesn't happen.

&gt; But this is ruled out because of asymmetry. The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

No, there is no ""center"" to the universe.  All points in the universe are accelerating away from all other points at exactly the same average speed per unit distance, so all points see all other points having the same redshift as a function of distance.

Take my balloon example. Instead of the stickers being photons, they are galaxies.  Inflate the balloon again. As far as each sticker is concerned, it seems like all other stickers are moving away from it, with stickers further away moving more quickly. But every sticker sees that, even though none are at the center. 

Also, this symmetry refutes the point about gravity.  If this was due to gravity, we would expect the redshift to change depending on the gravity in that area.  We don't see that.  Instead the redshift is extremely uniform.

&gt; -Another problem hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

Yes, on average objects are moving away from each other at a certain speed, but that is only an average.  Some are moving away from us faster than others, and some (like the Andromeda galaxy) are moving *towards* us. 

Take my balloon example again, but instead of stickers they are ants wandering randomly.  As you inflate the balloon, there is going to be variation in their speed relative to one another.

&gt; Btw, I have no idea what redshift is. I am interested in biology and evolution, not the Big Bang theory.

Redshift is the observations that on average stars have a shift in their frequencies to the red end of the spectrum. This means they are moving away from us. The further they are from us, the more they are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, and thus the faster they are moving away from us.

This has to do with the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and color.  The frequency and wavelength of light are essentially synonymous, but people usually talk about frequency while wavelength is more useful here.  

Light waves, like all waves. repeat.  The distance or time between two repetitions is called the wavelength (distance and time are synonymous since light in a vacuum travels at a fixed speed).  The smaller that distance or shorter the time, the more energy a photon of that light has.  Frequency is the inverse of wavelength. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, and the higher the energy.  A photon of red light has a lower frequency, longer wavelength, and less energy than a photon of blue light.

The reason that there is a red shift has to do with something I said towards the beginning: since the big bang, the universe has been expanding. It isn't just objects moving away from each other, space itself has been stretching.  Since space is stretching, light that is moving through space is also stretching.  This results in the wavelengths getting longer, and thus the light shifting more towards the red (lower-frequency) end of the spectrum.  The further the light has traveled, the more space has expanded while it has traveled, and thus the more red it has become.

We know that it has gotten more red because we know what the frequency should be. Each element absorbs and emits energy at particular characteristic frequencies (these are due to the energy in their electrons, which is a whole other can of worms).  So by comparing the patterns of bands we see to what the patterns of bands should be for real elements we can tell how much it has shifted.

This same principle applies to redshift due to gravity, except that is so weak it is practically impossible to measure even with modern instruments, while redshift due to the universe expanding was discovered more than 90 years ago.",7,1505789490,2017-09-18 22:51:30

309,"&gt; *Where did the intial mass energy come from?

&gt; *What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

The real question is why can't we say ""I don't know"" as an answer to these? This is a variant of the first cause argument. By definition, the first cause argument is always going to come down to ""I don't know"". At the moment we don't know what happened before the big bang. We have ideas, but we're not certain. If we find out what happened before the big bang, you can ask what came before that. Then the answer will be ""I don't know"".

The thing is creationists say God created everything, and God existed eternally before that. That simple narrative covers the entire history of the universe, and answers every possible question about origins. But that's all it is, a narrative. It doesn't address evidence, or logical inquiry. It just states an idea, and its believers assert that idea as truth. They compare their beliefs with naturalistic beliefs based on two completely different standards.

&gt; Astronomy is a hot bed of evolution.

Astronomy and cosmology are completely separate from evolution. This is a strawman. It's a case of creationism redefining evolution to cover an entire naturalistic worldview so that they can attack that position instead.

&gt;-The dominant theme today is the Big Bang theory.

Yes, but details of the theory are still up for debate and subject to change.

&gt;-The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos and immense explosion of mass-energy about 14 billion years ago.

All we know is that space is expanding and everything is moving apart. If we run time backward, then things will get closer together and space will contract. Eventually, the entire universe would have been condensed to an extremely small volume that would have been immensely hot.

But this is more or less in agreement with the scientific consensus, ignoring the loaded word ""chaos"".

&gt; Ever since, matter has been expanding outward. Stars, galaxies, planets, and people graduallly formed from these fragments.

More or less. The Wikipedia article has a very detailed breakdown of the early evolution of the universe. There are some issues and unsolved problems  with our theories, but this is a really hard problem with very little evidence to work with.

&gt;-Evolutionists must tread lightly over problems like:

Again, these are problems for physicists and cosmologists. Unless it's alive and has DNA/RNA, biological evolution does not apply.

&gt;*Where did the intial mass energy come from?

Don't know. As far as we can tell it's always existed.

&gt;*What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

Don't know. Such a dense and energetic state is naturally unstable and would expand, but it was the universe itself expanding. We have no idea what rules govern entire universes.

&gt;Ignoring these problems, what evidence is promoted for the Big Bang?

These problems are getting to the limits of science. It's not particularly well-suited for answering ""why"" questions, and it's *really* hard to get data pertaining to the origin and properties of the early universe. Most of what we know about it is based on inferences and extrapolation based on observations and our understanding of physics.

Science doesn't have the benefit of divine revelation. We can only work with what we have at our disposal and follow where the evidence leads.

&gt;-The measured redshift in the light radiated from different stars. Light from most stars is found to be reder (longer wave length) thus moving away. Thus the universe is expanding. But, hubble was causing trouble, further out, younger galaxies all over, are mixed with older galaxies. Also, light can be redened by gravity. (Einstein predicted this in 1912. Gravity can bend light.) As light moves away from a star its energy is lessened and thus its frequency is shifted. But this is ruled out because of asymmetry. The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

This isn't a problem. The universe itself is expanding. It's not so much that things are moving apart, but distances are just getting larger. Imagine drawing points on a deflated balloon, then blow it up. As the balloon inflates, all the points move away from each other. From the point of view of the points, each one appears to be the center of the universe (the surface of the balloon).

&gt;-Another problem hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

I'm not qualified to address this point specifically. But I imagine that relative motion of galaxies could account for this.

&gt;(Btw, I have no idea what redshift is. I am interested in biology and evolution, not the Big Bang theory.

Redshift is refers to the phenomenon where light becomes redder as the light source moves away. The wavelength of light determines it's color, and moving the source away ""stretches"" the light, increasing the light's wavelength and making it appear more red.

Think of when ambulances or police cars drive by. As the vehicle approaches, the sound waves are compressed and sound higher pitched. As the vehicle moves away, the sound waves are elongated, and the pitch drops. This is analogous to blueshift (compression) and redshift (elongation).",9,1505784321,2017-09-18 21:25:21

Certainly.  And it is difficult to reconcile this with a global flood.  You would think there would be more mixing.

&gt; evolution has occurred

Well no.  The fossil record is primarily sudden appearances followed by stasis, and the gaps increase as the taxonomic hierarchy is ascended.  This pattern better fits design than evolution.

Using the Poisson distribution, if each virus produces at least e\^2.6 = 13.4 copies of itself, then on average 1 will have no new mutations.  You mentioned that T7 uses rolling cycle replication, which may mean that unlike for other organisms the Poisson may not be the right distribution, but regardless there will be a distribution with some having fewer mutations and some having many more.

Humans and complex mammals also have much more than 2.6 del. mutations per generation.  Even at 2.6, selection is much stronger in your RNA virus than a huge-genome mammal:

1.  300 thousand fewer nucleotides in an RNA virus means each has a much higher selection coefficient on average.
2.  A larger total population in RNA viruses makes selection more easily able to act upon mutations with small selection coefficients.
3.  Mammal DNA is linked in huge blocks of millions of nucleotides, making beneficial and deleterious mutations hitchhike together, and it can take hundreds generations to separate them out at the granularity of the size of an RNA virus genome.

1.  Bacteria and simple eukaryotes just about all have far far less than 1 mutation per generation.
2.  RNA viruses have up to 1-2 mutations per generation.
3.  Humans and other mammals have around 100 mutations per generation.

So #1 probably doesn't have a problem with del. mutation accumulation, #2 sometimes does or doesn't, probably depending on a lot of different factors, and it's inescapable for #3, even if we assume only 10-20% of DNA is nucleotide specific functional.",2,1505783025,2017-09-18 21:03:45
316,"&gt;  what other specialists in the field

Scott Buchanan is a chemist, not a geneticist.  I've spent a lot of time already reading through his two responses to Sanford and he makes a ton of errors.  Pick a point he makes and we can go through it.

Other population geneticists largely agree that:

1.  Humans are currently in a path of declining fitness.
2.  Evolution can only produce function at a very slow rate.

The main difference between them and creationists is how much DNA is functional vs junk.

317,"&gt; -Evolutionists must tread lightly over problems like:

&gt; *Where did the intial mass energy come from?

The simple answer, of course, is that biology is not cosmology. You don't go to your automechanic for advice on how to fix a toilet.

If you asked a cosmologist this question, they might say that [the total mass of the universe adds to zero.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-energy_universe)

&gt; What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

Cosmologists might disagree over the word ""unstable"". 

The circumstances surrounding the very, *very* early universe are things cosmologists are still working on. You might introduce yourself to the books and videos of someone like Sean Carroll who has made cosmology somewhat accessible. Lawrence Krauss is another name you might google.

&gt; ...what evidence is promoted for the Big Bang?

[I really can't compete with wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Observational_evidence)

&gt; I have no idea what redshift is. I am interested in biology and evolution, not the Big Bang theory.

You know how when a fast car approaches you, it sounds high-pitched, but as it passes you, the sound drops in pitch? Even little kids playing with toy cars will go ""rheeeee... whumm..."" It's called the Doppler effect. Like sound, light also moves in waves, and so a light source that moves towards you is going to have you measuring a higher frequency, than if the source was moving away from you.

By looking at the light from distant galaxies, based on the Doppler effect, we can measure how fast they are moving away from us (or towards us). Hubble's big discovery was that most galaxies are moving away from us (they are red-shifted, as the frequency of light from those galaxies is a bit redder than normal) and that those that are farther away, are moving *faster*. This observation was the one that led some scientists to think the universe was expanding. We have a lot of other evidence to support this, as I linked to above.

Your teacher is a hack. Biology and astronomy aren't really related, except for a few interesting areas like organic molecule formation in space. Only creationists tend to lump cosmology and biology into the same group, because both disagree heavily with a literal interpretation of the bible.

It's not an argument from incredulity when it's backed up with solid mathematics.

&gt; That's a description of natural selection. I'm not sure what you are trying to argue, but you have found a quote from Darwin describing natural selection.

Of course it's a description of natural selection. It's a direct quote from Darwin's paper. But Darwin's description, involving infinity and immeasurable subtleties, is a ""metaphysical"" formulation, which could be true, but fails as a theory because it is untestable and unfalsifiable.

322,"I do not think there is such a thing like methodological naturalism. Scientific methodology is about the primacy of observations and this requires the avoidance of any preassumption about reality - also about naturalism as its foundation. It works like this:

- we only deal with observable phenomena;

*No assumption about naturalism made.* Only about the principle of observability.

- we provide hypotheses about the causal relationships between these (observable) phenomena;

*Still no assumption about naturalism made.* Only about the need to build a causal model.

- we also provide a sound model that provides an outline of the mechanisms that determine such causal relationships and these mechanisms *also must be observable*;

*Still no assumption about naturalism made.* Only about the need to precisely detect the mechanisms of the causal model and the requirement that those mechanisms must be observable on their own.

- we test the hypotheses and models per observational evidence;

*And even now still no assumption about naturalism made.* Only the principle of testing per observational evidence.

- when the observational evidence contradicts the hypotheses and models, they thereby are falsified and either need to be adjusted or discarded.

*And even at this point no assumption about naturalism made.* Only applying the principle of primacy of observational evidence to the causal model and hypotheses.

See? I shortly outlined the methodological principles of science and didn't need to assume *anything* about naturalism. These principles are *void* of any assumption about naturalism. As much as they are void of any assumptions other than naturalism. As a matter of fact, ANY proper and valid methodology does not assume ANYTHING about the properties of the object of research. That would be a louse methodology to begin with.

But *in the same time* you can easily see why supernatural ""entities"" just won't meet any of those methodological requirements and again and again fall off the table.

The next observation is when you do assume supernatural entities, it mostly leads to nowhere. Praying, studies showed, do *not* help you. Their results even indicate a worsening effect - although I think that praying as such is not the damaging factor but the mere fact that praying people tend to avoid proper help. (Praying though may help you mentally to get through the dark moments - ""whatever gets you through the night, it's alright"").

Because this topic isn't really relevant to evolution, which is the focus of this sub. /r/creation would be the place to go if you want the opinion of creationists, although you will need mod approval to post there. This seems on-topic and honest, so I expect they would allow it.

&gt; I am talking about the explanation of why immune systems exists in the first place in the framework of creation?

This is actually an interesting question, and I hope you do post it over there because I would like to see their responses.

Some adhere to the belief that life was originally ""perfect"" and harmonious, with suffering and imperfections (under which bacteria and viruses would fall) only appearing after the big screw up in the garden. For them, the question could summarized as, ""Did Adam and Eve have an immune system?""

If they did, it seems like God was planning for our failure, although it could be spun as a thoughtful backup plan in case we screwed up.

If they didn't, then there is the question of where immune systems came from. They are probably too complex to be the result of the kind of adaptation that most creationists accept. I would imagine that most would just claim that God interfered to give us a fighting chance.

You can't really catch creationists with ""gotchas"" like this. They have an infinitely flexible position thanks to an unconstrained meddling diety that's willing to jump in an patch up any holes. ",2,1505770761,2017-09-18 17:39:21

Where are all the intermediate languages? All the transitional speakers? If languages are constantly changing into other languages, there should be plenty of speakers that are speaking half Latin and half French.

And you're ignoring the problems of linguistic entropy. Most incremental changes to languages will just produce nonsense words and meaningless/ambiguous sentences. How exactly are languages supposed to evolve if the transitional speakers can't even understand each other?

Not to mention that the shear complexity of the problem is mind boggling (not that it would take much LOL). The probability of all the French words spontaneously forming out of Latin characters in someome's mind is at least 1/2^(99999^9999^...), which is a really, really small number. I just don't see that happening.

And all this supposedly occurred over the course of only a couple thousand years, at most! Impossible.

326,"&gt;What you are referring to when you say something that contradict observatiions

I'm asking why creationists come here and demand uncontroversial and clear evidence for our claims while lacking any evidence for their own claims, somr even admitting that no evidence *could* exist for their claims.

&gt;Before you answer, keep in mind Bible doesn't try to explain natural phenomens like science does. It speaks at a metaphysical level and often use an allegoric language to do so.

I'm aware of this, but my question was aimed more at biblical literalists. They are the ones who have to deal with discrepancies between what the scripture claims happened and what we observe as having happened.

So not only do they lack evidence, but they must explain evidence that does not support their conclusions. Yet they ignore this and just demand more evidence on our part.

&gt;So if you try to read the Bible as a science textbook you'll find it very inaccurate, but you will not understand  what the words really mean.

I would question the value of using such a text to acquire empirical knowledge about reality at all. For spiritual purposes, sure, knock yourself out. But any interpretation that you use to claim something about our objective reality must pass the same test as all other such claims: actually matching observations.

&gt;Scientific method requires proofs (repeatable laboratory experiments) to prove theories real.

Repeatable experiments don't prove things, they generate data that serve as evidence. This evidence can support many explanations, and rule out others. Repeatability is nice, but lots of evidence is historical. We have to work with what we have.

The scientific method is inductive. We propose hypotheses, collect data, and reject hypotheses that are not supported by the data. We can never *prove* something in this manner as our experiments are limited. We can't test every possible set of initial conditions, we can't perform enough experiments to completely separate signals from noise, and we can't be sure that the experimental results hold always and  everywhere. We can only increase our confidence in our models as they pass more and more tests.

You could have tested Newton's model of gravity everywhere on Earth for as long as you like and gotten results consistent with your predictions. It's only when we watched Mercury closely that we noticed a discrepancy. 

&gt;Until then you can believe in theories and hold evidences true, but others cannot.
&gt;This is Galileian scientific method too

As far as I can find, Galileo pioneered the use of induction and experimentation as a method of supporting and rejecting hypotheses. In other words, he's the first one to argue that evidence is the best we can hope for and good enough. ",2,1505766578,2017-09-18 16:29:38

I didn't discuss prophecies of the Exile, because you'll say that the prophecies were made after the fact, which they weren't, but there are separate prophecies that tell the exact number of years of exile (70, one year for each seven of 490 years that Israel ignored the command to observe the sabbath year), and even the name of the king, Cyrus, who will permit them to return from exile.

There is a host of reasons the prophecies in Ezekiel don't apply to the first exile. They were in one nation-city, Babylon, not scattered all over the earth. God didn't hunt them down, nor drive them back.

I'm afraid that if you were a Hebrew wandering in the desert, you would have thought nothing of the fact that they collected manna (the name means: ""what is it?"") on six days only, but if they got lazy and tried to collect for more than one day, it went rotten and stank. But no manna came on the seventh, and the two days' supply they collected the day before didn't rot. Their sandals and clothing didn't wear out during their 40-year wanderings.

I'm giving the modern-day state of Israel as an example of fulfilled prophesy because all your doubts over whether it actually happened are quashed (it's happening before your eyes) and you can't say it was altered after the fact (we have millions of Bibles that were written before the events even looked possible).

Anthropologists say that a totally dead language can't resurrect (ever heard of Esperanto?), but the Jews did it.

They defeated enemies on all sides (Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon) in the Six Day War in, well, six days. They neutralized Egypt's air force in an afternoon, and defeated Egypt's military in the world's largest tank battle on the Sinai desert, surrounded the entire Egyptian army, and could have marched on Cairo if they had imperial designs. But they didn't. They let the Egyptian soldiers return, an event that Egypt celebrates as a great military victory to this day. They flew across the entire African continent and successfully rescued Israeli and other hostages from Idi Amin in Uganda, in a brilliant and nearly flawlessly executed operation filled with intrigue (watch the movie *Raid on Entebbe*). Since no nation would cooperate, they had to refuel in-flight on the way there and back.

373,"&gt; You know I posted a paper that outlines the specific steps to get from one structure to another, right? You ignored that post, but it's way up near the top of the thread.

OK, then let's discuss the flagellum. Has anyone, for this example or any other equivalently complex structure, enumerated and detailed the mutations necessary to bring it into existence where nothing like it existed before? You don't have to go back in history and name the actual mutations that occurred to satisfy me, but you *do* have to get specific and detail a *possible* pathway, mutation-by-mutation, and where the mutation does not enhance fitness, you have to again get specific and show the exact accompanying trait on the genetic linkage block that carried it to fixation. I claim that no pathway exists. Your papers speak at the high level; I claim that those pathways do not exist (ever heard of ""the devil is in the details""?). I have many times hatched wonderful, novel computer ideas in my head that, when I actually try to design them, are complete flops.

I don't claim that no pathway exists just to be obstinate. I have designed FPGA mutation-selection routing algorithms to route circuit boards and gate array chips that are too complex to be routed by hand or even by conventional computer programs. A certain level of success is achievable -- a higher level, in fact, than can be achieved by any other means. But the final result is far from the theoretically most efficient route, and looks like a rat's nest. And the controlling variables require vigilant regulation by intelligent agents (us) to produce any result at all. It is not like we just threw the circuit schematics into a blender and the results came pouring out. Many highly educated and motivated computer scientists and programmers spent careers designing the software.

Mutation/selection doesn't work. Evolution theory can be labeled, ironically, a ""metaphysical"" theory -- that is, it may be true, but cannot be demonstrated.

Darwin constructed a metaphysical formulation for natural selection when he wrote:

&gt; Owing to this struggle for life, **any** variation, **however slight** and from **whatever cause** proceeding, if it be in **any** degree profitable to an individual of **any** species, in its **infinitely complex** relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving.

Try finding a null hypothesis for that one!

375,"I am not a ""God of the gaps"" adherent (but I claim you are an ""evolution of the gaps"" adherent). Evolutionists cannot validate their most fundamental claims, but just say, ""evolution did it"", with no evidence to support it in many cases.

Scientists maintain that they are neutral on the question of naturalism vs. supernaturalism, since its determination is a philosophical issue. Therefore, intervention from outside nature cannot be ruled out. Miracles may happen. Yet the BDMNP categorically dismisses the possibility of assigning extra- or super-natural causation to any natural event. That means that scientists, hobbled by the BDMNP, are unable to recognize supernatural causation, no matter how blatant the evidence might be.

As I say, you evolutionists-of-the-gaps automatically assign a naturalistic evolutionary cause to every phenomenon, regardless of whether the evidence is abundant or totally lacking. Yet, you have nothing but the BDMNP, a philosophical, nonscientific presupposition, as a reason for excluding supernatural causation.

So if miracles cannot be ruled out without subscribing to philosophical naturalism, and you say that you are neutral on the naturalism vs. supernaturalism question, what if one does happen? Could you, under any circumstances, identify that a miracle happened? Or would you go on endlessly attempting to assign a naturalistic cause to a supernatural event?

I do not attribute unknown causes for natural events to supernatural agency. That would be ""God of the gaps"". Rather, I assign supernatural agency to natural events that violate known laws, where we have seen that intelligent agents can easily violate these laws, yet it is not possible for an intelligent agent within the natural realm to supply this agency.

Furthermore, as with any scientific conclusion, I hold these attributions to supernatural agency to be scientifically tentative, vulnerable to reversal should future new evidence warrant. Thus, it is not a ""science-stopper"". We, the supernaturalists, and you, those hobbled by the BDMNP, can continue to perform research to either reinforce or overthrow the conclusion.",0,1505714890,2017-09-18 02:08:10

Oh boy.

Sal, at least explain for once in a while: why are you lying all the time?

I just LOVE this one:

&gt; I asked an evolutionist over at TheSkepticalZone.com if he actually saw an act of special creation or a miracle before his own eyes, would he still believe in evolution? He said yes! That would only convince him God could do what evolution could do already!!!! 

Yeah but WHEN did that happen, Sal, those miracles and acts of special creation and WHAT are the chances of it happening in the future? Poor Sal even can't imagine how the overwhelming majority of Christians in the word outside his echochamber and cocoon think that god created the universe and used evolution to create life. Not my stance but at least trying to reconcile faith with modern science - which, as tose Christians realize, makes minced meat out of the Bronze Age myth caboodle.

Poor [Nomenmeum](/u/nomenmeum) is little bit more cautious and asks Sal:

&gt; Is the difficulty here one of constructing a coherent tree of life that relates these two? Is it that the proposed transition from one to the other is not probable?

No, there is no difficulty at all constructing *three* trees of life no less (DNA, molecular and morphological) that perfectly match mutually and relate both.

380,"The Bible gives a running account of things that will happen at some future time (future from when they were written) in Ezekiel 36, 37, 38, and 39. If we go back, say, 200 years, all the events chronicled there were still in the future. But we *know* what the Bible said 200 years ago. We have tens of millions of copies, at least, of Bibles printed before that time. At that time, ancient Israel (""Palestine"", a name which I dislike because the land of Israel was never an independent country in the 1700 years since 67 AD, and no city in its borders, including Jerusalem, was ever the capital city of any other country) was ""trodden down by the Gentiles"" ([Luke 21:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+21%3A24&amp;version=NRSV)), the Jews were a hated and persecuted subculture that was scattered worldwide (look up the definition of a [pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom), [ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto), or Henry Ford's [International Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Jew), for instance), Hebrew was a ""dead"" language (i.e., no one spoke it as his mother tongue or thought in Hebrew). The Bible even prophesied the Jewish persecution (which you might claim is a self-fulfilling prophesy). In [Ezekiel 20:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+20%3A32&amp;version=NRSV), God prophesies that His people will attempt to ""blend in"" with the Gentiles, as they did in Germany, resisting the Zionist movement and thinking themselves Germans first, then Jews. In the following [verses 33-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+20%3A33-38&amp;version=NRSV), God prophesies that the Jews will be scattered among the Gentiles, but that He will exercise wrath on His people and forcefully drive them back to their land (can anyone say, ""Nazis""?). God's anger with His people continues pretty much unabated throughout the book of Ezekiel, up to chapter 36. There, in [verses 22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+36%3A22-24&amp;version=NRSV), God says that He is going to regather the Jews, even though they are still a mostly secular people that have forgotten their God. This has happened. The [next verses, 25-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+36%3A25-32&amp;version=NRSV), are a mixture of already fulfilled and yet-to-be fulfilled prophesies: the land of Israel will blossom, and God will replace their heart of stone with a heart of flesh. In my opinion, the former has occurred but the latter not.

###But here's the amazing part:

In [chapter 37 verses 1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37%3A1-10&amp;version=NRSV), the ""Dry Bones chapter"", God yanks Ezekiel out ""by the Spirit of the Lord"" (i.e., a vision or dream) and... well, just read it. It's pretty clear and self-explanatory. The first time I read it as a new Christian some 39 years ago, I was reading chapter 37 in the Bible my wife had just bought me (and I still use). Verses 1-10 finished a page, so I [stopped to reflect before turning the page](https://imgur.com/a/MYoBy). ""What did God mean by this vision? Was it literal or symbolic?"" I didn't know, so after a moment I turned the page. [God answered the question for me](https://imgur.com/a/WAYes). It was symbolic, but of a literal event, yet to come. Notice in the previous link, that on the bottom of the page, the footnote to verse 11 correctly identifies that this vision clearly states that at some time, Israel would be regathered into its ancient homeland, and the time of God's punishment of Israel will be over. But note that it says, ""an event which is still future"". This footnote was apparently written before 1948, and was not yet updated to reflect current events of the day! These chapters are being fulfilled before our very eyes! I was born a few weeks after the new state of Israel declared itself on May 14, 1948. Since then, more Biblical prophesies have been fulfilled than in any other time, other than the days of Jesus. Read [37:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37%3A21&amp;version=NRSV); after more than 2500 years, who knew that Israel would be reborn on its ancient homeland, resurrect the Hebrew language, and fight and defeat oil-rich enemies that outnumber them 50:1! Although I have to say that I expected things to come to a head even faster than they have (on the basis of Jesus' prophesy in [Matthew 24:32-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A32-35&amp;version=NRSV)), it is dizzying to see the events that have occurred out of these chapters. For example, just recently Russia (Magog in [38:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+38%3A2&amp;version=NRSV)) established alliance with Iran (Persia in [38:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+38%3A5&amp;version=NRSV)). That is an amazing turn of events.

No culture other than the Jews hold a Scripture as sacred that prophesies as much doom and gloom on itself, and that repeatedly calls itself ""stiff-necked"" (stubborn and rebellious).

###So, to summarize, the Bible correctly predicts:

* The Jews, Israel, will be ripped out of their homeland because of God's anger
* They will be scattered among all the nations
* They will attempt to assimilate in their new homelands
* God will not allow them to identify with that land over their real ancient homeland
* God will hunt them down and vent His wrath on His people
* God will drive them back into their ancient homeland
* God will do this before the Jews deserve it, to vindicate His holy name
* God will make the new nation of Israel blossom like a rose
* God will remove the Jews' heart of stone and replace it with a heart of flesh
* God will bless nations that bless Israel (France, England and USA at various times)
* God will curse nations that curse Israel (long list)

###Future:

* Dreadful wars are yet to come
* Israel will defy all odds and come out victorious

I've yet to be presented with any good reasons to support such a belief. 

So far, all the examples we've encountered show that minds are the products of physical brains.

For example, when my mother-in-law had a stroke, the doctors correctly predicted that she would have near-total vision loss, but could regain some vision over time. That prediction was spot-on.

Physically speaking, Grandma may be just that - a collection of atoms. 

But, consider that what is of value to us is the *arrangement* of those atoms.

The arrangement may not matter in an objective sense, but it matters subjectively to humans or other arrangements of atoms that are capable of making value judgements.

You're supposed to reply to the person you're trying to address, big boy. 

&gt;You called me a wanker. Well, let me call you a moron in return

I said that you're acting like a wanker, which you are. Big difference. 

&gt;all I can say is that you are not seeing the argument.

I see your argument but I don't accept its premise and I think the whole thing is founded on faulty confirmation bias and ignorance of key factors. Truth be told, I don't think you understand the issue of population statistics or poor data sampling. 

&gt;You need to stop assuming that all the data to form your conclusions has been already provided to you so that you can then agree with me.

If you haven't provided all of the data then do it. That's how debates work. Withholding information from the other side is intellectually dishonest. 

And fuck no, you're not entitled to people agreeing with you especially when you've apparently willingly withheld data.

&gt;It is wrong to assume that all the data should be provided by me

Literally the opposite is true. Sit down big boy because I'm going to explain something to you. In a debate, one side brings up a premise and arguments about their positions such as....creationists are secretly racist. They then provide the data they have to back the argument up. Other people are then able to contest the argument made and point out errors in reasoning, how the data is either wrong or is being applied incorrectly, and even provide data of their own. Then the first person is able to defend their side of the argument and try to poke holes in the second person's argument. This can go on for as long as either side wants. 

Do you get it now? Do you understand how actually it is your job to provide the data for your argument if you're making an argument.....which creationists being racists for not debating chinese scientists is. 

 &gt;If you don't see the argument, then say that.

Once again, I see the argument. I **disagree** with its conclusions and think it's a faulty argument to begin with. 

&gt; But first, agree to do something constructive in this debate -- rather than simply point at me to fix whatever has gone wrong with it.

I'm not being constructive? You do realize that pointing out why your argument is shit is constructive? I'm not going to jerk you off through the internet telling you how awesome your arguments are when they're really total crap. And the fact that you're withholding the full argument is so intellectually dishonest, I seriously question if you aren't just a creationist trying to make the other side look bad. Holy hellfire you really don't understand how any of this works. 

&gt;I am not going to waste my time developing my arguments into something tangible so that someone I don't know can make sense of it

If you're the one forwarding an argument, it's your job to convince them, big boy. 

&gt;You don't seem to understand that I am trying to introduce a new idea

I don't care. The idea is shit. It's premise is faulty and its conclusions are shit. Do you understand this? The idea you are forwarding to the forum is just plain bad. It's wrong. Creationists are all somehow racist because you yourself haven't seen any like Ken Ham debate chinese and indian scientists? That's a poorly reasoned idea and as I've pointed out in my replies to you, which you've then blocked me for whatever stupid reason, there's a myriad of reasons why you personally aren't seeing creationists debate chinese and indian scientists other than racism.

397,"&gt; Ok, so then why don't they debate people who are non-whites?

Loaded question and an argument from ignorance. You are assuming they don't do it rather than they haven't done it, as if they are actively choosing not to debate people who aren't white. Secondly you are assuming because you haven't witnessed a creationist debate with someone who isn't white then it's never happened.

Have you seen a creationist debate a woman? If not does that mean creationists are sexist? Of course not.

&gt; What is your theory?

My answer is that there is inconclusive evidence that creationists don't debate non-whites therefore there isn't anything to make a theory on, let alone a hypothesis. I've no reason to assume that just because I haven't see such a debate that they don't happen because racism.

&gt; And how do you know I am not ""a Westerner""?

Because you said in your title that you are Sri Lankan. See I came to that conclusion based on evidence, that's how you do it.

&gt; I just find this line of reasoning totally weird.

Why do you find it weird that people in particular countries tend to talk to people from the same country and not as much other countries? You're the one with weird reasoning, assuming that creationists are likely racist.

How often do you see comments from South African people? Icelanders? Brazillians? Not often I bet. Does that make you racist or does that mean that these people tend to hang out in their parts of the internet more than the parts you hang around in just like Western countries mostly hang around their own?

I also will support his one.

When Ken Ham build his Ark in Kentucky, it took a construction-team of more than a thousand Amish craftsmen, heavy, modern equipment including cranes and iron pegs to hold the structure together. Yet the construction took more than a year to be built.

The Kentucky arc is completely unsuited for maritine shipping. As a matter of fact ship building engineers will tell you that not a single such a large, wooden ship can sail the oceans - it will not survive the enourmous friction of the undulating water waves, not even if the beams are held together with iron cramps - which Noah didn't have because for that you have to live in the iron age. Beyond a particular size, you just can't use wood to build ships. not even with building techniques of modern times. Hence, never has there any wooden ship been built of the size of Noah's arc.

I also need to inform that the arc was built in an environmental friendly way according to the LEED standard, including geothermal heating, rainwater capture, active and passive solar heating which I hoestly think is as such to be appreciated.

422,"Mishtle, new person being dropped into this debate. Call me Mr. M.

Let me debate with you on why the statistical argument is plausible. I agree that it may not be persuasive. In fact, I am not persuaded myself. Personally, I don't know if the racism is on the part of Creationists / there are racial barriers for, say, African-Americans to advance their names to Creationists for them to their credentials to be taken into such consideration as may be needed and a debate to be organized based on such consideration / there is bias in American society as a whole / there is structural racism which has impact outside of its immediate environment leading to profound cultural biases in terms of perception. I don't think any of us do. 

(a) But it is also odd that most, if not all, of the scientists that the Creationists and the religionists choose to debate are virtually all white. Let me start off with a short list of names- Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Bill Nye, Sam Harries, et cetera, et cetera. All white people.
(b) The fact of the matter is that there are *more* non-white scientists than white scientists -- around the world. So, isn't weird that only white people are picked?
(c) There is no reason to believe that Ken Ham is walking around Kentucky to pick his debate opponents. It is not as though they have to be within walking distance of his HQ for him to be able to talk to them.  In fact, he probably uses email, the Internet and what not -- despite being a Creationist. He is not exactly blind to the benefits of science and technology.

Let us build a statistical model here.

It would be like having two urns: 

(*) Urn A has 100 hundred balls in it -- all white. Urn B has X (X &gt;= twenty thousand) balls in it -- of many different colors, none of them white. 
A ball is picked with replacement from one of the two urns. 

Now, the experiment could be set up in one of two ways:
(a) either the urns are chosen at random with 50/50 chance, or
(b) the urns are chosen based proportionally weighted depending on the number of balls that are there in that urn. So that if X= 100 million, and the number of balls in the two urns are 100 to 100 million, then the chances are 1:1 million that the first urn is picked.

If someone said that they are pretty much always picking white balls, you wonder if their selection algorithm isn't somehow unfairly weighted. 

I think that is a pretty solid model, which illustrates what might be going on. The Creationists might have an unconscious bias in terms of what a scientist ""should look like"". And they proceed accordingly, picking their opponents in part based on their preconceived notions of  variable Z (where Z = ""scientist appearance"".)",1,1505686079,2017-09-17 18:07:59

Yes and ""believe in Jesus and follow him"" (basically the thing required for salvation and arguably one of the entire points of Christianity) is universal. Across every denomination.

443,"&gt;Well, this is a statistical argument

Statistical arguments require knowing something about the underlying distributions at play, otherwise they are not very persuasive.

Your claim that they are racist based on the few online debates you have seen where they only debated white people relies on the following assumptions:

- A considered opponent is equally likely to belong to any of a number of ethnicities.

- There are no correlations between ethnicity and the non-ethnic factors involved in evaluating opponents.

- Your observations are uniformly drawn from all the debates on the topic that have occurred.

If these assumptions held then you could reasonably infer racial motivations in choosing opponents if that's what the data shows, and your argument would get stronger with the more data you collect.

But they don't hold.

China and India. You know, where Chinese and Indian people are most likely to be. 

&gt; how come virtually all my samples come back with creationists debating people who are (i) not South Asian and (ii) not Chinese?

Because all of your samples take place in western countries from the look of it. You responded to another person asking why Ken Ham doesn't debate Chinese/Indian scientists (why those two particular groups anyways?) and it's because Ken Ham works in Kentucky and there's far more rural white people there than there are Chinese and Indians. 

&gt;that is actually not true. I know both Indians and at least one Sri Lankan who are interested

Ask them if they've ever debated any creationists and if not, ask why. If the answer isn't ""They didn't like Chinese/Indian people"" then it's a moot point. 

&gt;I am using just the debates on the Internet for my sampling. I am talking about Creationists debating Indian and Chinese scientists.

It's even harder to find debates based on race on the internet since a lot of internet identities are anonymous and there's no guarantee that Indian and Chinese scientists will use their internet presence to debate creationists. Hell, the vast majority of white scientists don't use their internet presence to debate creationists. 

&gt; that makes the case for ""White Privilege"" in scientific circles. That is, some people are advantaged in the scientific community because they are white.

And where have you seen a creationist actually make that argument? They've claimed that evolution is racist and that science has been used to promote racism, but they've never once to my knowledge made any claims about science having white privilege. That's the kind of stupid crap you find from social justice warriors who are less likely to be creationists. 

&gt;Racism is, in my opinion, a significant factor in almost everything.

Well maybe it's time to re-evaluate what you believe in because you personally never seeing videos of creationists debating scientists from a specific race doesn't mean those creationists hate members of that race.

Which is not true because each part of the flagellum that is ""removed"" from the system turned out to be functional and each part that is left after the ""removal"" as well.

22,"&gt; Okay so of course I lean towards the agnostic side of things, because both religion and evolution have things that need more proof.

Well, in a scientific context, ""proof"" only exists in mathematics and alcohol.  Science works with evidence.  In science, evidence is defined as a collection of facts that are either positively indicative of, and/or exclusively concordant with, only one outcome above any others.  In that vein, we have demonstrable and repeatable evidence that evolution happens, in the lab and in the wild.  Conversely, we have nothing that meets the definition of evidence with respect to the supernatural claims of religion.  

&gt;  Isn't that what makes a human a good human, if he helps the human race flourish?

Well, according to those Christians you align with, works don't count for anything, all that matters if faith.  

&gt;  I thinks I'm the missing link anyway because I got big feet.

Heh.  Well, there hasn't been any missing links for a long time now.  There was a missing link in 1859 when there were only two species of humans yet known in the fossil record, and no intermediate fossils to link them with any of the other apes we knew of at that time.  Since then, we’ve found the fossils of thousands of individuals of dozens of hominid species, many of which provide a definite link to the other apes.  But there were two particular pieces predicted to complete the puzzle: 

First, it was never supposed that we evolved from any ape species still alive today.  Instead the theory held that chimpanzees and humans were sibling species, daughters of the same mother (so to speak).  So, the first link we needed to find was an ancient ape apparently basal to either of us –to prove there was a potential progenitor of both groups.  We had already found that link in Europe five years before Darwin went public, so we already had an evident “chain” of transitional species from which only one more “link” was needed. 
 
The theory then required that another extinct hominid be found in strata chronologically between the Miocene *Dryopithecus fontana* and the earliest known human species, which from 1891 to 1961,  was *Homo erectus.*  We’ve found lots of candidates, as many as fifty species of apes which are now all extinct.  But more than that, the theory also demanded that we find one “half-way” between humans and other apes in terms of morphology.  We found exactly that too way back in 1974.  *Australopithecus afarensis* proved to be a fully bi-pedal ape who’s hands, feet, teeth, pelvis, skull, and other physical details were exactly what creationists challenged us to find, yet they’re still pretending we never found it. 

But worse than that, we didn’t just find that one.  In 1977, three years after we discovered the no-longer-missing link in the human evolutionary lineage, Harvard paleontologist, Stephen J. Gould mentioned an “extreme rarity” of other clear transitions persistent in the fossil record ‘til that time, and his comment, -taken out of context- remains a favorite of creationist quote-miners to this day.  But in the more than 30 years since then, there has been a paleontological boon such that we now have way more transitional species in many more lineages than we ever needed or hoped for.

Now the problem for evolution is that there are too many contenders, while a compounding problem for creationists is that not even one of them should exist if their story was true.  And yet they do –by the bushelful!  Despite their complaints to the contrary, the intermediate gradations in the human evolutionary line are now so fine that paleoanthropologists can’t agree whether they’re all different species or merely mildly modified varieties of the same ones, such that there are no more links needed for human evolution anymore.

24,"I am saying that a non-irreducibly complex precursor can lead to an irreducibly complex structure.

A stone arch is irreducibly complex. Removal of any stone in an arch will cause it to collapse. However, its precursor, an arch with scaffolding around it, is not irreducibly complex. You can remove a stone and it will still stand.

Similarly, if parts of a structure can be modified, then things that were once optional can become essential, making a non-irreducibly complex structure irreducibly complex.

Also, if parts of one structure can be re-used in another structure, components that were optional in the first structure can be essential in the second.

So irreducible complexity is only an issue for systems where parts can only be added. A system where parts can also be removed, modified, or re-used can easily produce irreducible complexity. Evolution can do all four, so it can produce irreducible complexity.",3,1501166626,2017-07-27 10:43:46

34,"&gt; ... if you could confirm that the rock dating methods were accurate, it's possible that evolution could have happened, and would gain some credibility in my eyes.

Piece of cake, already around for some 5 decades - as an example, here are the results of dating the layers of the Hell Creek formation where important dinosaur fossil were sitting in:

Name of the material | Radiometric method applied | Number of analyses | Result in millions of years
-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------
Sanidine | 40Ar/39Ar total fusion | 17 | 64.8±0.2
Biotite, Sanidine | K-Ar | 12 | 64.6±1.0
Biotite, Sanidine | Rb-Sr isochron | 1 | 63.7±0.6
Zircon | U-Pb concordia | 1 | 63.9±0.8

&gt;*Source: G. Brent Dalrymple ,“Radiometric Dating Does Work!” ,RNCSE 20 (3): 14-19, 2000.

Applying several dating techniques simultaneously on the same specimens (in this case different specimens from the same geological stratum) is called calibration, a VERY efficacious way to account for the methodological validity of measurements. Because all of the abovementioned dating techniques work on different principles and the odds of yielding the very same result by sheer random chance when applying such different techniques on the same specimen is virtually nil, *especially*, as creationists claim, when these techniques were to be flawed.

As a matter of fact, after all, even *if we didn't know the the absolute age of rocks*, evolution is still an inevitable and inescapable conclusion we necessarily must draw from the fossil evidence. And we only need one assumption to make here: geological layers sitting on top of deeper ones, are younger - and this is sheer logic because it is impossible to envision new layers being formed below existing ones. Example: when we find a layer A with fish fossils, we know it must have a former sea or lake floor. When this layer is sitting below layer B that only contains fossils of land animals, we know for sure A can't be formed later than B obviously. Yet, such sequences of subsequent geological layers we observe abundantly.

Now what do we observe more? Well:

- the geological formations below our feet show many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer was a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ribbles and buried dune structures indicate a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a shallow sea floor again, ending up in deep sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that they contain fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, yopu find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find *any* of the following groups of extant life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bancterial mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ).

- whole classes of species that are living today are lacking in the older formations and there is, literally, not a single specimen to be found that breaks this rule.

In other words, there is no other interpretation possible for these observations: *life forms changed over time*. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. The fossil record testifies of macro-evolution on *an epic scale*.

And, yet, again I didn't assume anything about the actual age of the rocks.",8,1501160907,2017-07-27 09:08:27

Not to be found in biology, genetics, paleontology or any other life science. So I have no idea what you mean with ""scholar"".

I think you must fundamentally change your perception of animals.

42,"&gt; I've also seen the whole God said and evolution happened creationism aproach but the sole fact come down to do you want to only live until you die or do you not care what happens afterward?

As I've stated before, it doesn't have to be either-or. If there is a God and he did create life, it created it with the property that organisms pass on an imperfect copy of their genetic traits to offspring. These genetic traits influence phenotypic traits, and environmental conditions favor certain phenotypic traits over others. Thus, organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass these beneficial adaptations on to the next generation, and the next generation will have some variable to enable the environment to continually test new traits. All of those observations are easily verifiable, and together they create a process of directed adaptation to a given environment, which we call evolution.

The fact that organisms change over time in seemingly directed ways is a observational fact. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria, domestication of plants and animals, HIV, nylon-digesting bacteria, lab experiments on *E. coli*, and the patterns in the fossil record are all clear evidence of this process that we can readily observe. Evolution by natural selection is a viable search method that is used in artificial settings to find innovative solutions to complex problems that we human could not ""design"" by hand or come up with on our own. In other words, we can mimic that process that I outlined above in software, and it works. I have used these genetic algorithms in my own work, and if there truly is a god involved in the design of life then all the evidence is pointing to them using one as well. 

Does it really say, ""believe *every* single word in this book literally or you will burn in hell"" in the bible? If not, then what stopping you from accepting clear patterns in the evidence? There is nothing in the theory of evolution that claims you will go to hell if you accept its interpretation of the evidence, or that makes any claims whatsoever regarding any religion. It is simply a very good description of the processes by which life on earth changes. 

&gt; When I said I align with Christianity I'm not there clean my soul I'm there because I'm trying to be optimistic and help people. Isn't that what makes a human a good human, if he helps the human race flourish?

Again, there is nothing about the theory of evolution that says anything to the contrary. As I've stated before, one of the things that got humans to our privileged position is our rich social structure, altruistic behavior, and teamwork. If we want to survive and flourish, compassion and empathy are important tools that need to be encouraged. When we work together, it's us against the world. When we turn on each other, it's each of us individually against the world and each other.

The people that have claimed that accepting evolution encourages a eugenics-like approach to survival misunderstand the theory, and ignore the extremely privileged position that we have created for ourselves.

&gt; I also hope I can see the people that died again one day.

Irrelevant (sorry!), but again evolution says nothing about this.

&gt; It also inspires me to be a better person which is nice for me and everyone else who is didn't get raised on good morales or even without parents. There's a reason there's so many people who have really fucked up in life go to church.

I don't dispute that religion has had and still does have some benefits. It was obviously favored by social and cultural selection throughout human history, and there is evidence that it was even favored by natural selection as well.

That said, religion can also bring many problems to the table. It can encourage us-versus-them attitudes, it can assert absolute truths or hold on to ancient traditions that make it difficult for adherents to assimilate with and accept other cultures,  it provides a belief in something greater than the individual that can be exploited for the personal gain of those in power, it encourages magical thinking and blind acceptance of authority, discourages critical thinking and objective evaluation of evidence, and it can encourage people to do things for ultimately selfish reasons (desire for personal salvation or to gather divine favor) rather than practical or pragmatic reasons. 

&gt; My point remains that there isn't concrete proof of either so why not choose to place belief with the loving people side of things that motivates you to become a better human and help stop world hunger. It would be nice. I thinks I'm the missing link anyway because I got big feet. 

Concrete proof is not something that is available when it comes to science and reality. The best we can do is interpret evidence and infer explanations. The best explanation we have for the history and current state of life on earth is the theory of evolution, hands down. Nothing comes close.

And nothing about the theory of evolution claims that hungry people should starve to death, so I really wish you would get rid of this arbitrary characterization of religious people as good, loving, caring benefactors and those that accept evolution as evil, uncaring, selfish jerks. This is a fabrication, and this clear distinction does not exist. Religion does not have a monopoly on ""goodness"", and in fact has a rich history of displaying the exact opposite. The truth is that humans can be ""good"" or ""bad"" independently of what beliefs they hold, and end up using those beliefs to justify their actions.

I personally would rather be on the side that values objective reality, rational thought, critical thinking, and recognizing this life as the only one we have and thus deserving of the utmost attention and care. Your god will not save us from our past, present, and future mistakes, and sticking our head in the sand and praying will not fix them. 

But again, this debate is not between religion and atheism, it is between scientific consensus and religiously motivated beliefs that ignore evidence in favor of placing absolute authority in the literal interpretation of ancient texts. It will not determine the fate of our souls, but will influence the fate of our most important tool for survival: rational thought.

55,"&gt; I think that if humans came from a monkey , why would we be the only sientient species on this planet.

Obligatory clarification that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor.

The exact series of environmental pressures that resulted in our ancestors developing sentience is still a mystery. However, we are not as alone as you might think. Other animals, particularly mammals and birds, are surprisingly intelligent. They can display complex social structure and behavior, tool use, complex vocalizations and communication, learning, planning, deception, empathy, altruism, and basic theory of mind. We even evolved alongside and eventually out-competed other hominids that were likely just as intelligent and capable. We now hold a monopoly on the ""intelligent generalist"" niche, making it difficult for other species to adapt in the same ways that we have. For whatever reason, we got lucky; much of evolution can be thought of as a series of accidents, being in the right place at the right time. But again, we really are not that special. If we disappeared overnight, another species could very well rise to the occasion and take our place.

&gt; I think there is more of a chance we were created than evolved because humans arent the strongest or the fastest creatures.

""Survival of the fittest"" is a bit of a misnomer when taken out of context. It does not mean that only the strong and the fast survive, but rather those that are best adapted to their environment. This adaptation can come in many forms. Humans are not the strongest or the fastest, instead we have survived through intelligence, teamwork, and endurance. You don't have to outrun predators if you can avoid them, hide from them, or trick them. You don't have to overpower adversaries if you can surprise them or use the environment to your advantage. You don't need to overpower or outrun prey if you can exhaust them, overwhelm them, or trap them. 

&gt; The chances that evolution making humans the only self aware species versus a alien giving us self awareness in this ever expanding universe is just an easy choice. 

This is a misinterpretation of evolution. What we see is exactly what we would expect. It's expensive for two species to compete for the same niche, making it unlikely for two species to adapt in the same exact way. The first species to develop our level of intelligence would have a significant home field advantage, and we have exploited ours quite effectively. Depending on what you mean by self-awareness, we may not even be alone on that front. Dolphins and whales show remarkable intelligence, but are somewhat limited by their evolutionary history and environment. Humans were lucky enough to already have sophisticated means of manipulating our environment in the form of our hands, and to evolve in a rich and varied environment that is extremely open to manipulation and exploitation. 

Your alternative is unsatisfactory for a couple reasons. Mainly, by what means would humans be ""given"" sentience, and where did these ""aliens"" get theirs? This does nothing but introduce new questions and push the problem back to the origin of these aliens. ",8,1501129364,2017-07-27 00:22:44

And it's possible there have been other intelligent species that simply died out before they could form a civilization. This almost happened to us about 70,000 years ago. 

We may not the strongest or the fastest, but we do have the greatest running endurance of any land animal. We would actually chase our prey until they collapsed from exhaustion. And our upright posture freed our hands to become excellent tool makers, which drove our brains to get even bigger.

The analogy is fine. Like most discussions of irreducible complexity this comes down to an issue of defining ""function"". With no stones, you can swim across the river. With a single stone you can do it more safely and consistently since you have a place to rest and recover. More stones let you jump across. The board lets you walk across.

Removing most of the stones under the board can make the board necessary for the function ""getting across the river without getting wet"" or ""carrying things across the river"".

62,What does this have to do with evidence?,9,1501109441,2017-07-26 18:50:41
63,"&gt;  Isnt evolution in the same way a hypothesis?

I was a bit generous in calling creationism a hypothesis. In most cases it is an assumed conclusion, and in the rest it's a failed or unfalsifiable hypothesis.

Evolution was a hypothesis at one point, back when Darwin first suggested that life changes through time through natural selection. Since then, the idea has made enough correct predictions and accumulated enough supporting evidence that it has transitioned to the status of *theory*. Theories in science are extensive and comprehensive collections of models and laws, together with supporting observations and evidence. They are the pinnacle of scientific knowledge and have withstood numerous attempts to disprove their claims and falsify their conclusions.

The modern theory of evolution was built by performing science. We made observations, proposed models, tested the models, and discarded/amended the models that failed our tests. It was constructed from the ground up, drawing conclusions from data and observations and finding or generating more data and observations to test those conclusions.

Creationism in most cases operates in reverse. The conclusion is that God created life, and this conclusion is assumed to be true. Then evidence and observations are shoehorned into this framework to support it. Anything that doesn't fit is thrown away. The conclusions are not made from data, the data is made to fit the conclusions.

Even when creationists try to go about it the correct way, it doesn't work. Some creationists have looked at the complexity of life and hypothesized that it was designed or created. That's at least the right direction, but it's a bad hypothesis. Good hypotheses need to be able to pass tests so we can know if they are wrong. We can't prove things right in science, so this is an important step that keeps us from pursuing ideas that are definitely wrong. For example, evolution would have failed if we did not find a method for traits to be modified and inherited. 

The creation hypothesis fails this test for several reasons. The most important is that we do not see a creator, nor do we see life being created or designed. The only evidence we have for a creator is the authority of religious texts. Without being able to interview the creator we have no reason to assume anything about their creative process, making it impossible to distinguish between created things and things generated by a natural process. In other words, we cannot falsify this hypothesis.

&gt; I think if anything, there are so many people who were raised in bad situations that turn their lives around for Christianity that I'd rather people believe in that than evolution. Realistically I think of myself as  optimistic for choosing to align myself with Christians but don't get me wrong I never want to knock on someone's door and tell them that they'll go to hell unless they accept my belief and think it's stupid. I would rather knock on someone's door and help them. Isn't the distinction between a good and bad humans determined around the choice to live with good morals? I think Christianity teaches just that, but I don't agree with a lot of the religion side of things. I'm the Christian that believes that Christianity is really just loving people. I believe the same thing a dioist does. The philosophy of love. 

I appreciate that you keep your religion to yourself and focus on the positive aspects of it. However, that is irrelevant to this discussion and to the larger debate.

There are plenty of Christians that do not reject the conclusions of science. It is even the official position of the Catholic Church to defer to science in most cases of apparent conflict with scripture. Science is not out to disprove the existence of God, it's only trying to describe and explain what we observe. The apparent conflict with theistic claims is self-inflicted by theists when they claim that God is intimately involved in processes that we can readily observe and explain through consistent, predictable natural processes.

The important part of this debate is that there are some religious people that are trying to subvert the teaching of objective science and critical thinking by including an ""alternative"" conclusion that essentially boils down to an appeal to authority. This is unacceptable. ",9,1501107138,2017-07-26 18:12:18

when you replace evolution with gravity the statement sounds completely absurd.  No one sits around debating about whether gravity is real, or whether it is 'just a theory'.
But in reality, we have more evidence for evolution than we do for gravity.
The only difference many theists think that evolution is at odds with the tenents of their faith, so they discard and deride evolution.  Even though it is confirmed through completely different branches of science and observation, backed by mountains of evidence and continues to pass the tests that would falsify it.

Evolution is a fact an observable fact.  The theory of evolution is simply the 'why' or 'how' of how the process works.  

the Theory of Evolution doesn't describe where everything came from.. it only describes how the observable fact of evolution works.

You can still love and treat people well and support the theory of evolution.

Creationism in *most* cases is not a rational belief. These people did not arrive at this conclusion through objective interpretation of evidence, which makes it difficult or impossible to dissuade via evidence. It is often rooted in emotion, religious faith, social pressure, and mistrust of secular science. As the saying goes, ""you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.""

As others have alluded to, this problem is not limited to the individual holding the belief, but also extends to the belief system itself. Creationism is not a science, making it immune to the methods by which science normally evaluates and discards hypothesis. It is an assumed conclusion. They are not looking for evidence and observations that contradict their hypothesis, only things that support it.

The T3SS isn't the only thought to be a homolog, there are also many others. The rotor's homolog, F1F0-ATP synthase, is a very ancient one because it sits at the very base of metabolism of all living cells. So the flagellum clearly arose by co-opting F1F0-ATP synthase. and then the many other ones. 

Hence, even *if* T3SS arose from flagella, we *still* have other homologs of the flagellum that beyond any reasonable doubt could never have been evolved later than flagella. And, thus, still it's proven that the flagellum is reducible complex.

Hox genes. Jawed vertebrates have four clusters. Arose via serial gene and genome duplication. Some of the clusters are missing some of the genes. So you start with, for example, one cluster with eight genes. (I'm making up these numbers because I don't feel like looking up the real numbers.) Two genome duplications. Four clusters, eight genes each. 

There's some loss of genes due to mutations - some gene become pseudogenes. If a required gene is inactivated, the organism dies. If an ""extra"" gene is inactivated, no big deal. So over time, you have all of the extras lost, and only the required genes remain, and you have something like four clusters, with seven, eight, six, and seven genes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, I made up those numbers, but something like that. The general process is that non-selective processes add neutral variation, selection pares it back to just what is necessary. These two operate all the time, pushing and pulling on genomes. ",3,1501039277,2017-07-25 23:21:17

This suggests a fairly ""direct"" path to the structural and/or functional precursor to most or all bacterial flagella, which was likely optimized and modified in various indirect ways after the divergence of bacterial lineages to result in the diverse flagella that we see today.

EDIT: I want to clarify something here. It's probably not correct to say they are exact synonyms, as the terms have difference uses and origins. The term [""interlocking complexity""](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/ICsilly.html) is derived from H. J. Muller, who described a process by which a structure can be built incrementally but end up being ""irreducibly complex"" by adding components and then modifying or removing others to make the added component necessary to the function of the structure. The example given in the link above is a series of stepping stones across a river, which can be improved by laying a board on top of the stones. The stones in the middle are rendered redundant by the board, and their removal makes the board necessary for the function of crossing the river since the stones would be too far apart.

So, irreducible complexity is a term developed by creationists to describe features that are apparently impossible to evolve, while interlocking complexity is a term used to describe these same features without that implication. ",2,1500893149,2017-07-24 06:45:49

...yes? That's how it works. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Our? Can you clarify?

The major bilaterian. Phyla like arthropoda, chordata, echinodermata, annelida (I think), the brachiopods (I forget if that's a phylum or not), and a bunch of other groups don't appear in the fossil record until the Cambrian. But they coalesce much earlier, meaning the the MRCA for all of these groups (which includes us, hence the ""our"") existed way before the Cambrian.

142,"&gt; Sorry, I was a bit vague. u/Denisova seems to imply that instead of the tree expanding exponentially from a single stem, existing branches diversified.

Correct, the Cambrian didn't start as a tabula rasa, the more pre-Cambrian fossils we find, the more diversified life seems to be at the start of the Cabrian. And this even still holds when we know that the previous era, the Ediacaran, ended with a mass extinction event due to Snowball earth. An extinction event opens many ecological niches to be filled by the surviving species diversifying and often triggers radiation events.

&gt; Our? Can you clarify? (&lt;our genomes that coalesce earlier than the Cambrian).

Our genome coalesce with those of chimpanzees because as primates we share a common ancestor with them. Our genome also coalesce with those of mice because as mammals we also share a common ancestor with mice. (... skipping a few steps...) Our genome also coalesce with those of [Spriggina floundersi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Spriggina_floundersi_-_MUSE.jpg/1280px-Spriggina_floundersi_-_MUSE.jpg), a pre-Cambrian species because as bilaterians we also share a common ancestor with Spriggina floundersi. The point of coalescence of the human genome with Spriggina floundersi is only laying far more back in time than the point of coalescence with mice or chimps.",2,1500809687,2017-07-23 07:34:47
143,"&gt; Which would leave a bunch of fossils behind.

- the formation of a fossil is a rather rare event, it takes a rare set of circumstances for an organism to be fossilized

- the older the geological layer, the less it's currently laying at the surface, open to investigation

- the older the geological layer, the more chance it's eroded away

- the older the geological layer, the more chance of it being subducted into the earth's mantle due to tectonic processes

- Cambrian life was entirely marine, except from bacterial mats. Many Cambrian sites currently laying at the surface were former dry land areas and no fossil to be find there

- many of the Cambrian organisms and probably all pre-Cambrian life mostly were soft-bodied, which causes the organism to completely vanish and many Cambrian fossils therefore are not the actual fossils but the cast in the matrix that was left

- many of the Cambrian organisms and probably all pre-Cambrian life were rather very small, microscopic, being hard to spot when you walk in the field as a paleontologist.

&gt; But it is still explosive.

No it's not really ""explosive"" for all the reasons I mentioned. That's why I put it between quotation marks. The official term is ""Cambrian radiation event"". For biologists and geologists, ""Cambrian explosion"" is only a nickname, just like Mitochondrial ""Eve"" and ""Y-chromosomical ""Adam"".

But by all means the Cambrian explosion was one of the most remarkable events in the history of life. If you want to emphasize that by using the qualification ""explosion"", be my guest but realize that in reality it wasn't much of an ""explosion"". Be careful with nicknames!

&gt; What are the best ancestral candidates then?

Depends on the specific phylum. and this is very difficult to establish due to a number of factors:

- soft-bodied organisms often do not leave behind real fossils (mineralized body parts) but only the casts the organism left in the rock maxtrix. Casts are far less detailed and difficult to interprete.

- the pre-Cambrian fossil record is even scarser than the Cambrian.

- all the reasons mentioned above but even more severely applying.

But [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6o2cy8/can_the_cambrian_explosion_still_be_used_as_an/dkhyk05/) I already tried to shed some light on the possible predecessors of trilobites.",2,1500808589,2017-07-23 07:16:29

146,"&gt;Indeed but in biological terms it represents 10 million generations, as we well may conclude that the generation time of those Cambrian organisms must have been 1 year or maybe even shorter. Diverse studies for instance, have shown that the evolution of the vertebrate eye from a mere patch of photosensitive cells would have taken only some 364,000 generations. But none of the Cambrian organisms did have vertebrate eyes but much simpler ones. Nilsson and Pelger found that, even parameters set most conservatively low, the evolution of the eye must have taken a few 100's of thousands years.

Which would leave a bunch of fossils behind. 

&gt;And then you have to count in that most of the changes in the Cambrian, as I explained earlier, weren't much spectacular but rather, using language as an analogy, ""dialects"".
Moreover, many of the phyla thought to have emerged in the Cambrian 50 years ago, are now pushed back in time to eras previous to the Cambrian, leaving ever less Cambrian diversity to be explained.

The article you linked doesn't seem to mention those phyla.

""The Cambrian, though “explosive,” should not be misunderstood to be instantaneously producing crown-group species.""

But it is still explosive.

&gt;Rapid evolution IS about diversification because diversification is caused by evolutionary change and the whole ""issue"" about the Cambrian explosion WAS the emergence of many phyla (=diversification) as we know them today, to be ""astonishing"" and unexplicable. Diversification and evolutionary change are two sides of the same coin.

My wording was a bit vague. 

&gt;As I wrote before, the diversification in the Cambrian merely involved ""dialect"" changes. And indeed of many phyla we have fossil evidence at the end of the Cambrian - as well as a few we don't have any fossil evidence of to trace them back to their eras of origin. And these fossil records are not quite massive but rather sparse, only comprising nine serious palonteological sites worldwide like the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang site.

Diversification is a primary effect of evolution. Different populations of the same species experience different selective pressures, causing them to take diverse evolutionary paths as each adapts to their specific environment.

What characterized the Cambrian period was that much of the earth was unclaimed by multicellular animals, and each new species created a new niche for other species to exploit. In the modern world, this branching pattern is often tempered by strong existing competition, making only a few branches viable.

What evolution predicts is that body plans will differentiate when organisms are simple enough that this will developmentally feasible.

That's odd, wouldn't evolution predict different species would evolve first? Then, as they became more different, different genus, then you could group their descendants in a different family, then all the way to phyla. That's what I mean when I say bottom up.

169,"DarwinZDF42 took the first article, I'll do the second.

&gt; It comes as a surprise to most people to hear that there is abundant evidence that the entire human race came from two people just a few thousand years ago (Adam and Eve), that there was a serious population crash (bottleneck) in the recent past (at the time of the Flood), and that there was a single dispersal of people across the world after that (the Tower of Babel).

Three mistakes here. I'll take them apart.

&gt; It comes as a surprise to most people to hear that there is abundant evidence that the entire human race came from two people just a few thousand years ago (Adam and Eve).

The actual genetic evidence is actual making minced meat out of this notion. Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome Adam are NOT our actual ancestors. Mitochondrial Eve, for instance, represents the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans, i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely from mothers to daughters.

First of all, it is a *great mistake* to assume mtEve was the only living human female of her time. That would be, by all biological and genetic means, sheer impossible. mtEve is the one you end up with when you go back in time from daughter to mother, but starting with *all* currently living women. So mtEve is the MRCA of all living humans in an uninterrupted lineage back in time. Like as depicted in [this graph](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--54SXzYYmtI/TuRYJtPazmI/AAAAAAAAAWI/rBlQe0Sg3Pc/s1600/Mitochondrial.png). 

Several people here already have pointed out to you that the title of ""Mitochondrial Eve"" is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but rather shifts forward in time over the course of human history. I add that mtEve was not the only living woman of her time. The other women of her time just didn't leave descendants all the way up to today. They may have descendants alive today but not in a direct female line, leaving only sons. And many even died childless leaving no genetic trace in the first place. Moreover, nuclear DNA studies indicate that the size of the ancient human population never dropped below tens of thousands.

Moreover, mtEve did not live 6000 but ~120,000 years ago. And she did not originate from the Middle-East, where the biblical story originates, but in Africa. And it is very unlikely that she lived in the same region as Y-chromosome Adam, let alone they could established a pair. And the most recent estimates tell that she didn't even lived in the same era but some thousands of years later than Y-chrom Adam, in some calculations even up to 140,000 years temporal disparity.

You *just can't* hijack an idea and horseshoe it into the biblical story of Adam and Eve. It not only is impossible to cram the concept of mtEve and Y-chrom Adam into biblical mythology, it is even diametrically opposing it. The *ONLY* thing that is binding the biblical account of Genesis to the genetic concepts of mtEve and Y-chrom Adam are the names ""Eve"" and ""Adam"", which, unfortunately I must say with hindsight, were given as nicknames to the mt-MRCA and Y-MRCA.

Could you please elaborate a bit on how ICR managed to present the genetic concepts of mt-MRCA and Y-MRCA to be depicting the biblical mythology of Genesis while de facto they contradict?

&gt; It comes as a surprise to most people to hear . . . that there was a serious population crash (bottleneck) in the recent past (at the time of the Flood).

Unfortunately the genetic bottleneck was supposed to be some 70,000 years ago and not 2000 BC as the biblical mythology of Noah depicts. Next, the cause was not a flood but by the Toba supervolcano eruption. But even that does not seem to hold groud as new studies revealed that the genetic bottleneck most likely must have been a pretty long event, some 100,000 years, only *ending* shortly before the beginning of the Stone Age some ~70,000 years ago. So the Toba eruption has been deleted from the list of possible causes of the genetic bottleneck observable in the human genome.

Moreover, the genetic calculations mostly estimate the lowest population size must have been some 10,000 individuals during this period.

Again the *actual* genetic evidence ICR is referring to, is completely discarding any biblical notion of a bottleneck ~2000 BC due to some catastrophe.

And thus, again, could you please explain how ICR manages to distort genetic notions to recruit them as evidence for a biblical myth while actually these notions contradict it.

&gt; . . . and that there was a single dispersal of people across the world after that (the Tower of Babel).

There was not a single dispersal from humans across the world but several of them. And they did not start from the Middle East, where most of the biblical stories take place, but from Africa. And these migration events were not from the time of the Babel myth but the first one, by Homo erectus some millions of years ago.

Whatever you find of the genetic conclusions above, you *are not allowed* to abuse them recruiting as evidence for something that's diametrically opposing them.

And up to now I only addressed *five* lines of text of the ICR article.

I shall also put an end to the silly idea that all humans are descendants of a single pair 6,000 years ago.
Of each gene there are several variants. Variant 1 of gene X may produce blue eyes, variant 2 brown ones. These gene variants are called alleles. Each individual carries max. 2 alleles: the one he/she inherited from his/her mother and the other from his/her father. A population of two people, as Adam and Eve are, can have a max. of 4 alleles. I am merciful because Eve was made of the rib of Adam and therefore must have had the very same alleles of the same gene as Adam. But, yeah I know, the almighty god. 

But Adam and Eve don't even matter as 2000 years later the Great Deluge flushed away all humans but the family of Noah. This population of a father, mother, three sons and their wives can only have a max. of 10 alleles. That is what i call a bottleneck indeed. But nowadays some genes in the human genome hve accumulated as much as 4,000 alleles or even more.

One would wonder how a population starting with 8 persons some 4000 years ago managed to increase the number of alleles for such genes from 10 to over 4,000.

This must have been evolution running at an insane pace. Moreover:

- *a lot of* new ""information"" - as creationists call it - has been added.

- I won't dare to call an increase in number of alleles ""genetic entropy"", although very popular among creationsists but unfortunately discarded by the direct implications of a 6000 year old human population of 2 persons, which also underwent a severe population and genetic bottleneck 2000 years later, reducing the human population to a mere 8 individuals.

If you know what I mean.

Darwin my friend, there are some areas where I disagree with Jeanson.  For example I think his explanation for Y-Adam/Y-Noah in that article is inadequate.  But his track record isn't any better or worse than yours or mine.  Because this comes up so often, I've kept a list of errors you've made in our own discussions--like when you said HIV required seven simultaneous mutations to evolve VPU, or when you misquoted me claiming I said all mutations are deleterious, then called me a liar.  I could just as easily make the same accusations against you that you bring against Jeanson, but I'm not.  And I've made errors too--like when I thought that linkage paper was referring to the LCA of all living humans, and it wasn't.

Here you're saying it's scanadalous for Jeanson to make alleged errors about the evolutionary model, but you get a free pass to misrepresent his creation model.

That is a moot point, because DNA is absolutely nothing like anything designed by humans.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Only two types of DNA sequences could act, hypothetically, like a simple clock. 

Any neutrally-evolving region (i.e. any region where mutations can occur at an approximately constant rate) of DNA can act like a clock. Only the Y chromosome and mt genome are inherited from a single parent, but the technique we're using to determine the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA), coalescence analysis, can be done with any region that accumulates mutations at a constant rate. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Unfortunately for the evolutionists, assumptions in past studies yielded divergent dates for the origin of modern males and females. 

These techniques do not measure the *origin* of males and females. They determine when the last male from whom all existing Y chromosomes are descended was alive (the MRCA for the Y chromosome). Same for mtDNA. There would have been tens of thousands of other people alive at the time, and we've all inherited other parts of our genome from them (for example, the X chromosome MRCA was ~500 thousand years ago). We know this is the case because of how much genetic diversity is present today. We cannot have that level of diversity if we all come from a single couple six thousand years ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[P]rior studies put the origin of females 100,000-200,000 years ago, but the origin of males about 50,000 years ago. Two recent studies published in the journal Science obtained the Y chromosome sequences of many more males, and these new data brought the formerly discordant results into general agreement at 120,000-200,000 years ago...The ""agreement"" was essentially contrived to make things fit together.

There's no reason the two MCRAs have to be at the same time. The data indicate they *may* have overlapped, but given human lifespans and the size of the ranges, probably not. Nobody's contriving anything; the rationale for such manipulation is just not valid. 

&amp;nbsp;

And that's before we get to anything about the validity of the data themselves. My point is, rather than believe what you're told, take a critical eye to it, particularly when the author, like Nathaniel Jeanson in that first link, has credentials in the field they're discussing. Either he truly doesn't understand how these techniques work, despite his credentials, or he *does*, and he *knows* what he says is incorrect. But these are trivial errors for a purported expert.

&gt;No, I am citing Of Pandas and People, the creationist Intelligent Design textbook written by the people who came up with Intelligent Design.

That's equivalent to making fun of Darwin because he believed in blended inheritance.

&gt;Cytochrome C, for example.

When I last checked, no one could agree on the trees. 

&gt;As I explained, it does. Any talk about junk DNA, for example, assumes a designer who designs like humans. So does your prediction about re-use. There is no reason a designer couldn't design things that violate your predictions. But humans typically don't, so you assume the designer wouldn't either.

There is also no reason that a designer would design something that would violate ID's predictions.

&gt;Only because it resembles things humans design. A being with completely different goals, constraints, and though processes could design something that is completely unrecognizable as design to us.

True, one could disguise one's design. ID does make the assumption that the designer thinks in a way like we do. But if something (say DNA) bore resemblance to something designed by humans, one would have reason to believe that it was designed.

&gt;So ""macroevolution"" is evolution at the level of a phylum?
Again, barring any barriers that would prevent macroevolution, there is no reason to think that successive changes cannot add up. It is like saying 1+1=2 is okay, but 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=10 is impossible.
Without evidence to the contrary, the default assumption is that rules apply in a general sense. If you think microevolution cannot add up to macroevolution, the burden is on you to show what exactly prevents it.

So evolution predicts that change will start from lower taxnomic levels, from the bottom up, and moving from species to phyla?

We do not postulate it, we *know* it. There are at least 9 phyla that do not have any decent fossil record.

&gt; Well, soft bodied embroyos and algae have been fossilized. 

Indeed and this and other finds led to the conclusion that many phyla, previously thought to have originated in the Cambrian, are now pushed back in time considerably. Next, we now know that the Cambrian did not start as a tabular rasa, as if different phyla emerged out of nothing - the Cambrian started with an already considerable biodiversity. For instance, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ediacaran_genera) is the list of Ediacaran (the era previous to the Cambrian) metazoan genera known *alone*, and it's constantly expanding - and then we have the the protozoa and other eukaryota and of course the prokayotes (bacteria and archaea).

&gt; We'd expect at least some precursors, seeing as trilobites are hard bodied.

Yes that would be nice but until now they are lacking to the extent that we have not a sufficient record. I don't see any problems here, because of other phyla we DO have such fossil record. But there are already some good candidates, but before introducing them, first have a look at the oldest trilobite found (until now), [Profallotaspis jakutensis](http://pre00.deviantart.net/a024/th/pre/f/2017/050/0/d/profallotaspis_jakutensis_by_ilyayungin1991-dazphun.jpg).

Some 6500 years ago (maybe even earlier) somewhere, most likely in the Pontic steppes area north of the Black Sea and Kaspian Sea (although not 100% affirmed), the Kurgan culture spoke a language we now call proto-indo-european, PIE. Inevitably there were dialects in PIE. Some 6000 years ago some of the PIE speakers started to migrate southbound into Anatolia (nowadays Turkey). Later another group split off and started to migrate eastbound and finally ended up in western China. Yet another 3 groups split up and migrated into Europe. The last one, 2500 BC, migrated to the region Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and northern India. So, in a matter of 1500 years the PIE speakers dispersing in all directions. 

Consequently, the PIE language began to diverge. What started as mere dialects, began to branch out into brand new languages. The first of these languages were (from oldest to youngest):

- proto Anatolian, later further diverging into the Anatolian languages, the most famous being Hittite, now all extinct

- proto Tocharian, eventually split up in Tocharian A and Tocharian B, both now extinct

- Italo-Celtic, which later split up in the Celtic group (Gealic, Breiz, Welsh) and the Italo languages (Oscan, Amrian and Latin, the first two extinct, Latin diverging later into the Romance languages)

- proto-Germanic, later branching into the Germanic languages

- proto Balto-Slavonic, later branching into theBaltic and Slavonic, both of them splitting further into the current Baltic and Slavonic languages

- proto Indo-Iranian, later splitting up in Sanskrit and Avestian, both of them branching of in the modern language spoken in northern India, Iran, Afghanistan and Kurdistan.

Now how much did these proto languages differ? Linguists think they would differ like modern languages of the same group do. They differed, for instance, like modern Romance languages among each other.

But, yet, the dialects of PIE gave rise for a complete language-family of close to 300 different languages, many of them already extinct and most of them mutally unintelligible. For instance, [this woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBv1ukVp9U) (Gaelic, Ireland) and [this woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJwaFw2lejA) (Bengali, Bangla Desh) speak related languages.

In the Cambrian, the differences between macrozoan life forms were much like the disparity of the first distinct languages that arose from the PIE dialects some 5000 years ago. The “phylum-level difference” in the Cambrian is rather *a small* set of changes that occurred when animals were first diversifying. These changes were not particularly “fundamental” or *radical* at the time, they were just *early*, just like the changes in the dialects of PIE were not fundamental but YET gave rise to future, further divergence, leading to whole new and quit different languages. All of the later changes that accumulated in each lineage were built upon these early changes, producing the appearance – *to our modern eyes* – of these changes being “fundamental differences”. 

Among extant organisms, the phyla are quite distinct now due to accumulated changes and extinction of basal stem groups. But when the phyla started to diverge, the differences were not so large, and many of the stem groups were still around. This is why many of the Cambrian fossils are difficult to categorize. If we attempt to cram them into modern taxa, many of them don’t fit, so we have to erect new phyla for them, even though the morphological difference between (say) a lobopod and a basal fossil arthropod or basal fossil onychophoran [is not large](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Lobopodia.PNG?1500623553040).

Basically: in the Cambrian we see a diversification *of stem-group organisms* (""dialects""), the subsequent and serial accumulation of traits in some lineages over time (with the loss of other lineages), and the eventual production of character sets in successful monophyletic groups that we retrospectively recognize as taxonomic groupings. That's also why all crown groups appear generally (much) later than the Cambrian. For a good explanation of stem- and crown groups, also their import for the Cambrian, read [this](http://biologos.org/blogs/dennis-venema-letters-to-the-duchess/evolution-basics-the-cambrian-diversification-and-assembling-animal-body-plans-part-2).

In other words, with our modern eyes the see extant phyla with huge differences, many of them originating in the Cambrian. So we conceive the Cambrian as a huge ""explosion"" while during those times it only involved ""dialect"" changes. Which as such aren't very impressive and as a matter of fact, easy to accomplish in evolutionary terms. Hence, the Cambrian explosion not only wasn't much of a real explosion in terms of time (20 million years) but also no gigantic blast but merely a few leafmeal puffs.",2,1500588062,2017-07-20 18:01:02

208,"&gt; The flagella doesn't support evolution. 

Sure it does. There isn't one ""flagella"", there are a wide variety of flegella with different levels of sophistication. And almost all of the components are cobbled together from other components. That is exactly what you predict from evolution, but not from intelligent design.

In fact there are two completely unrelated flagella, the bacteria flagellum and the archae flagellum, that are cobbled together from completely different structures and work in completely different ways.

&gt; Sorry, but are you citing rationalwiki? How about an actual prediction?

No, I am citing Of Pandas and People, the ~~creationist~~ Intelligent Design textbook written by the people who came up with Intelligent Design.

&gt; Citation?

[Cytochrome C](http://chemistry.umeche.maine.edu/CHY431/Evolve2.html), for example.

&gt; For the ID claims too.

Isn't that why you just said?

&gt; Source?

[Here](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765612880/ENCODEs-junk-DNA-findings-renew-debate-about-creation-evolution.html), for example:

&gt; ""As for me, I'm not sure I follow the reasoning here and that's what bothers me,"" said Wood. ""First, why should I think that every aspect of design has to have a 'function'? ... What use is a Statue of Liberty or a painting of soup cans? It seems to me that insisting that designs must be functional is sort of like a person who goes to an art museum and constantly complains, 'What's that for?' ""

&gt; Except that you've gone from unfalsifiable to falsified.

When their claims are falsified, they just makes the claim more and more vague until they are unfalsifiable.

&gt; ID does not make any predictions about the nature of the designer.

As I explained, it does. Any talk about junk DNA, for example, assumes a designer who designs like humans. So does your prediction about re-use. There is no reason a designer couldn't design things that violate your predictions. But humans typically don't, so you assume the designer wouldn't either.

&gt; To go to Will's watch analogy, one could not infer who the watchmaker is, but one could conclude the watch was designed.

Only because it resembles things humans design. A being with completely different goals, constraints, and though processes could design something that is completely unrecognizable as design to us.

&gt; ""major evolutionary change. The term applies mainly to the evolution of whole taxonomic groups over long periods of time.""

This is no better. What is ""major""? What level of ""taxonomic groups"" are you talking about

&gt; We don't see phyla diverging directly.

So ""macroevolution"" is evolution at the level of a phylum?

Again, barring any barriers that would prevent macroevolution, there is no reason to think that successive changes cannot add up. It is like saying 1+1=2 is okay, but 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=10 is impossible. 

Without evidence to the contrary, the default assumption is that rules apply in a general sense. If you think microevolution cannot add up to macroevolution, the burden is on you to show what exactly prevents it.",3,1500560728,2017-07-20 10:25:28
209,"&gt; IC assumes that there will be no viable way to get between these functional intermediates.

That's a poor assumption in many cases, and difficult to support. As long as we can find one such pathway, this assumption is invalidated. You would need to show that such a transition is completely impossible in all cases, which is impractical to achieve.

&gt; Did I claim that all lifeforms were created at once?

No, which is why I made sure to include an ""if"" and then go on to respond to the iterative variety of ID as well. My point is that this would be the one case where the evidence would allow us to clearly distinguish between alternatives.

&gt; Easy. Evolution is by its nature gradual. Design is quick.

And my point is that it's extremely difficult to distinguish between these two cases when you have random snapshots of the process that are thousands or millions of years apart. The fact that there is order and progression in the the fossil record supports a gradual incremental process. And again, attributing this to design is making assumptions about the designer and their process.

&gt; We do see this in the Cambrian.

The Cambrian was an ""event"" on geological time scales, meaning it occurred over millions of years. There are also clear trends within it. There is nothing in evolutionary theory that prevents rapid radiation and diversification of species, particularly when there are new niches opening up at rapid rates coupled with strong selective pressures. To the contrary, this is entirely in line with what we would expect.

&gt; If DNA were designed, one would expect to see a large amount of functional parts.

We would also see that if DNA evolved under selective pressure for a functional purposes. This comes down to a debate over the definition of ""function"" and the degree of functionality we would expect under each case. There is absolutely DNA that appears to have no  significant function beyond structural inertia and latent biochemical activity, and the original classification of ""junk DNA"" was overzealous in that we did not understand the regulatory and dynamic aspects of the genome. The fact that some single-celled organisms have genomes larger than complex mammals should be a hint that not all DNA actively contributes to the biochemical processes that support life.

&gt; In which we see large amounts of Complex Specified Information that is unlikely to arise purely by chance. Designed systems would also exhibit irreducible complexity. Designed systems exhibit ""disparity before diversity.""

Again, these are all making assumptions about the designer and their process. 

&gt; Except that one could infer that something was designed.

Not without knowing what to look for. The only things we *know* for an absolute fact were designed are products of human. Our artifacts stick out like a sore thumb from our natural surroundings, except when we design them to not.

&gt; Does DNA contain random noise?

You did not understand my statement. DNA is not an electromagnetic signal, but there absolutely is noise in the cellular environment. My point is that there are intelligent signals saturating the Earth's atmosphere, but if you were to just listen it would appear to be random noise because we 

&gt; Sorry, but designed objects always have certain features:

I'd like to direct you to an art gallery then. Design according to certain processes often has specific features. We know nothing about this proposed designer or their process. We can therefore know nothing about their designs beyond assumptions. ID fails before it ever gets started by assuming that there is a designer and then working backward. We have no evidence or observation of a designer, we should not make such an assumption.

&gt; Unlikely to have emerged solely from natural processes

This is just assuming your conclusion. 

&gt; Large amounts of CSI

Poorly defined concept. No reason to assume that natural systems could not appear to have this feature with regard to whatever it is that they do.  ",2,1500558098,2017-07-20 09:41:38
210,"&gt; All the sources I've checked list the Cambrian as taking place at roughly 20 million years.

The [offical](http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2017-02.jpg) time period of the Cambrian is 541 MYa to 485 MYA. That is 56 million years. There is some variation in the top 10 google results for ""cambrian period"", but none below 40 million. Where did you get 20?

&gt; That's actually an interesting answer. Would that mean that there is a limit to how much species can evolve?

Of course, organisms are ruled by the laws of physics and chemistry. Evolution will never overcome those.

But in terms of developmental limits, yes and no. 

In principle, it would be possible to overcome the barriers imposed by their development, such as by evolving to a much simpler state ([Placozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placozoa) and [Myxozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxozoa) appear to have done this). 

In practice, however, the evolutionary constraints organisms face would mean this pretty much never happens. There are scenarios someone could imagine, such a mass extinction that left only a handful of species, that could result in this happening, but it is highly unlikely.

This only applies to animals, though. Plants, fungi, and single-celled organisms have no such developmental limits",2,1500556905,2017-07-20 09:21:45
211,"No, it doesn't say anything remotely similar to that. It says that the diversification happened over time, with diversification of body plans happening first, followed by a long period of progressive diversification within groups with the same body plan. 

Many members of those groups have left no ancestors today. Amongst those that did, their common ancestors appeared at fairly random times during the diversification period. 

This is exactly what evolution predicts. The problem with the ""Cambrian explosion"" was that, a century or so ago, that wasn't what we saw. The limited fossils we had made it look like the diversification was much faster. But lots of fossils discoveries since then have given a much more complete picture.

Creationists still stick to the out-of-date version because it did their goals, not because it has any relevance.",3,1500555816,2017-07-20 09:03:36
212,"&gt;Most examples of apparent irreducible complexity have been debunked in the sense that viable incremental pathways have been found or proposed. IC also makes the false assumption that intermediate structures have no benefit.

IC assumes that there will be no viable way to get between these functional intermediates.

&gt;Fossilization is a rare, complicated, and unreliable process. It would not be unexpected to see this purely as a result of sampling effects. If all lifeforms were created at once, we should see an approximately uniform distribution of species throughout the fossil record. 

Did I claim that all lifeforms were created at once? 

&gt; Under the weaker form of ID that claims iterative design, depending on how the designer operates it could be very difficult to distinguish the resulting fossil record from one generated by evolution. 

Easy. Evolution is by its nature gradual. Design is quick.

&gt; I do agree that the haphazard appearance and disappearance of species with no clear trends would be suspicious, but we do not see this.

We do see this in the Cambrian.

&gt;Commented out code makes it into production software all the time, as do defunct parts that rarely or never get executed. We do find unused DNA within genomes, how much would you expect from a designer? How much would you expect from a sloppy designer?

[If DNA were designed, one would expect to see a large amount of functional parts.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-junk-dna-and-what/) 

&gt;I would disagree. Choices made by designers can be largely arbitrary. Without knowing the process by which a designer designs, or the preferences they use to evaluate their designs, it may be impossible to distinguish between their designs and a natural process. Just consider the vast variety of designs that humans have produced.

In which we see large amounts of Complex Specified Information that is unlikely to arise purely by chance. Designed systems would also exhibit irreducible complexity. Designed systems exhibit ""disparity before diversity.""

&gt;Again, I would disagree. The behavior, motivations, goals, and preferences of the designer has a significant effect on the resulting designs.

Except that one could infer that something was designed.

&gt;We have already found ""designed"" signals that have turned out to be human-generated

Human generated signals are Intelligently Designed signals.

&gt;When humans transmit signals, we often augment them through encodings, compression, and/or encryption for various reasons, with the result often being indistinguishable (by design!) from random noise without the proper tools and knowledge to recover the original signal.

Does DNA contain random noise? 

&gt;We can infer macroevolution from observed microevolution because the process is consistent and predictable. Designers need not be.

Sorry, but designed objects always have certain features:

- Unlikely to have emerged solely from natural processes 

- Large amounts of CSI

Yet we would expect to see at least some fossilized precursors, as many Cambrian animals are soft-bodied.

&gt;We don't have many fossils from the specific period we expect trilobites to have evolved during
The fossils we do have from that period are too low quality to definitively identify
There is a good chance we do have trilobite precursor fossils, they are just too low-quality to be sure

216,"&gt;Again, the Cambrian alone was about the same duration as the time since dinosaurs went extinct. Pretty much every animal you know today only appeared in 1/5 that period.
The entire period of diversification started about 600 million years ago and lasted about 150 million years. So a full 1/4 of the time from the start until now was taken up by the diversification period. It is hardly ""rapid"" even on geologic time scales.

All the sources I've checked list the Cambrian as taking place at roughly 20 million years.

&gt;The ancestors of modern organisms would not have been like mice, they would have been simply worm-like forms. Changes in Hox genes would have been trivial for them. Changing Hox genes only becomes a problem once large, complicated developmental processes evolved based on a particular pattern of Hox genes. Extremely simple animals would not have had that problem since they would not have had complicated developmental processes, or complicated anything for that matter.

220,"&gt;Evolution predicts this too. Features that match ID's definition of ""irreducible complexity"" are almost inevitable with evolution. However, evolution predicts that we will, in fact, see precursors to such ""irreducible complex"" structures, while ID predicts that we won't. And we do see such precursors, which supports evolution not ID.

The flagella doesn't support evolution. 

&gt;No, ID predicts all major groups will ""appear suddenly and without any precursors"". Which is, of course, not what we see.

Sorry, but are you citing rationalwiki? How about an actual prediction?

&gt;Which is not what we see. How genes and features are re-used is highly correlated with how closely related organisms are. This is the exact opposite of what ID predicts.

Citation? For the ID claims too. 

&gt;Except it does, so this also refutes ID.
Cdesign proponentsists respond to this by saying that they don't know the goals of the designer, so it may choose to include useless stuff.

Source?

&gt;So all four of those predictions are ultimately refuted. Not a great track-record.

Except that you've gone from unfalsifiable to falsified. 

&gt;Yes, we would. We would need to assume the entity thought in a similar way to us and thus designed signals in a similar way to us. If they didn't, we wouldn't be able to recognize a signal as a signal. They would have to have similar needs to us, or else they wouldn't have signals to begin with.
The same is true for a designer. You can only infer design by assuming that the designer has particular goals and methods. It would be possible for a designer to include a lot of ""discarded genetic baggage code"", for example. You can only make that prediction by assuming that the designer designs things a way similar to humans. Same with the rest of your predictions, they assume a certain design approach similar to humans.
ID has completely failed at making any sort of prediction that doesn't assume a designer who designs in a manner fairly similar to a human. Of course when a particular prediction is refuted, they fall back on ""well we don't know what the designer would do"", but that just means that their ideas make no testable predictions.

Irrelevant. ID does not make any predictions about the nature of the designer. One does not need to know who the designer was to infer design in an object. To go to Will's watch analogy, one could not infer who the watchmaker is, but one could conclude the watch was designed.

that's a pretty much correct definition used quite commonly in biology.

Evolution only becomes a funny word in the troubled minds of creationists who invent their own definitions, like ""simply change over time"", put them into the mouth of the actual scientists and start ranting about ""imprecise definitions"".

230,"**Chomsky hierarchy**

In the formal languages of computer science and linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy (occasionally referred to as Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy) is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars.

This hierarchy of grammars was described by Noam Chomsky in 1956. It is also named after Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of formal languages.

***

**Regular language**

In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular language (also called a rational language) is a formal language that can be expressed using a regular expression, in the strict sense of the latter notion used in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many regular expressions engines provided by modern programming languages, which are augmented with features that allow recognition of languages that cannot be expressed by a classic regular expression).

Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by a finite automaton. The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as Kleene's theorem (after American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene). In the Chomsky hierarchy, regular languages are defined to be the languages that are generated by Type-3 grammars (regular grammars).

In formal language theory, a context-free language (CFL) is a language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in programming languages, in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

***

**Context-sensitive language**

In theoretical computer science, a context-sensitive language is a formal language that can be defined by a context-sensitive grammar (and equivalently by a noncontracting grammar). Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.

231,"After spending some more time thinking about this question and the OP mentioning self-organization, I've figured out a kind of relationship among these topics.

Crystals, fractals, and life can be roughly mapped to the [Chomsky hierarchy of languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) in automata theory.

Crystals map to [regular languages]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language), recognizable by simple finite state machines. The basic feature of these languages is repetition of patterns.

Fractals could roughly map to [context-free languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_language), which require basic stack-based memory to recognize as they allow patterns with recursive structure.

The complexity of the genome allows life to generate nearly any pattern with some basic practical constraints, placing it near the top of the hierarchy and most likely mapping to [context-sensitive languages]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_language). These languages are recognizable by Turing machines with bounded random access memory

237,"&gt; High information content machine-like irreducibly complex structures will be found.

Evolution predicts this too. Features that match ID's definition of ""irreducible complexity"" are almost inevitable with evolution. However, evolution predicts that we will, in fact, see precursors to such ""irreducible complex"" structures, while ID predicts that we won't. And we do see such precursors, which supports evolution not ID. 

Cdesign proponentsists respond to this by saying those were only *possible* examples of irreducible complexity. They don't actually know what is and is not a real example of irreducible complexity.

&gt; Forms will be found in the fossil record that appear suddenly and without any precursors.

No, ID [predicts](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cdesign_proponentsists#Example_from_the_trial) *all* major groups will ""appear suddenly and without any precursors"". Which is, of course, not what we see.  

Cdesign proponentsists respond to this by saying that those are only possible examples of the sorts of forms that would appear. They don't actually know what are the real examples of the forms that appeared ""appeared suddenly and without any precursors.""

&gt; Genes and functional parts will be re-used in different unrelated organisms.

Which is not what we see. How genes and features are re-used is highly correlated with how closely related organisms are. This is the exact opposite of what ID predicts.

Cdesign proponentsists respond to this by saying we don't know the designer, so they may have chosen to re-use components in a way that exactly matches what evolution would predict.

&gt; The genetic code will NOT contain much discarded genetic baggage code or functionless ""junk DNA"".

Except it does, so this also refutes ID.

Cdesign proponentsists respond to this by saying that they don't know the goals of the designer, so it may choose to include useless stuff.

So all four of those predictions are ultimately refuted. Not a great track-record.

&gt; For example, if SETI were to detect a signal from an intelligent extra-terrestrial civilization, we would need not know how that life form arose to determine that there was indeed an intelligent entity that sent the signal.

Yes, we would. We would need to assume the entity thought in a similar way to us and thus designed signals in a similar way to us. If they didn't, we wouldn't be able to recognize a signal as a signal. They would have to have similar needs to us, or else they wouldn't have signals to begin with. 

The same is true for a designer. You can only infer design by assuming that the designer has particular goals and methods. It would be possible for a designer to include a lot of ""discarded genetic baggage code"", for example. You can only make that prediction by assuming that the designer designs things a way similar to humans. Same with the rest of your predictions, they assume a certain design approach similar to humans.

ID has completely failed at making any sort of prediction that doesn't assume a designer who designs in a manner fairly similar to a human. Of course when a particular prediction is refuted, they fall back on ""well we don't know what the designer would do"", but that just means that their ideas make no testable predictions.

&gt; And if one needs to directly observe design, can one directly observe macroevolution?

Define ""macroevolution"".

&gt; We observe microevolution, then extrapolate to macroevolution.

It isn't extrapolation, they are literally the exact same thing.

&gt; In the same way, we can observe features of design and observe biological systems to see if they exhibit those features.

Those need to be features that are more consistent with design than evolution. Unfortunately, to the extant that ID has done this, those predictions have turned out to be false, as I explained above. cdesign proponentsists respond to this by making their predictions more and more vague until they are not testable at all.",5,1500474463,2017-07-19 10:27:43

240,"&gt;  rapid evolution is the norm, when Darwinism predicts gradual change, something is wrong.

Again, the Cambrian alone was about the same duration as the time since dinosaurs went extinct. Pretty much every animal you know today only appeared in 1/5 that period. 

The entire period of diversification started about 600 million years ago and lasted about 150 million years. So a full 1/4 of the time from the start until now was taken up by the diversification period. It is hardly ""rapid"" even on geologic time scales.

&gt; Mutating Hox genes also have very unfortunate effects, as shown by experiments on mice.

The ancestors of modern organisms would not have been like mice, they would have been simply worm-like forms. Changes in Hox genes would have been trivial for them. Changing Hox genes only becomes a problem once large, complicated developmental processes evolved based on a particular pattern of Hox genes. Extremely simple animals would not have had that problem since they would not have had complicated developmental processes, or complicated anything for that matter.",5,1500471320,2017-07-19 09:35:20
241,"&gt; No, we say ""Our current theory can't fully account for this,""

**yet**. You don't abandon the theory based on that, you wait to see whether new information allows the current theory to account for it, or whether another theory comes along that better predicts both the existing information *and* new, currently unobserved information. 

&gt; Fine. The relatively short period of the Cambrian, as well as the lack of precursors, fit into what ID predicts.

No, ID explicitly [predicts that](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cdesign_proponentsists):

&gt; Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc

Which means there would be a diversification time period of zero years, not 400 million years for the sorts of features they are talking about. And what ID predicts is simply not what we see in the fossil record, even when it was first described. Intelligent Design was disproven before it was even formulated. And fossils since then show even more that ID's predictions are wrong.

Cdesign proponentsists deal with this issue by making ID more and more vague until it makes no specific, testable predictions at all. It becomes consistent with any possible observation, but fails at being a useful hypothesis because it cannot provide specific predictions about what we would and *would not* expect to see if ID was true. So even if there are problems with evolution, ID cannot and will not be a replacement until it can provide such specific, testable predictions and those predictions turn out to be true more often than evolution.",6,1500470378,2017-07-19 09:19:38

251,"&gt;If an object was designed, we would expect to see certain features:
&gt;
&gt;(1) High information content machine-like irreducibly complex structures will be found.

Most examples of apparent irreducible complexity have been debunked in the sense that viable incremental pathways have been found or proposed. IC also makes the false assumption that intermediate structures have no benefit. 

&gt;(2) Forms will be found in the fossil record that appear suddenly and without any precursors.

Fossilization is a rare, complicated, and unreliable process. It would not be unexpected to see this purely as a result of sampling effects. If all lifeforms were created at once, we should see an approximately uniform distribution of species throughout the fossil record. Under the weaker form of ID that claims iterative design, depending on how the designer operates it could be very difficult to distinguish the resulting fossil record from one generated by evolution. I do agree that the haphazard appearance and disappearance of species with no clear trends would be suspicious,  but we do not see this. Thus it comes down to a question of the degree of order and gradual progression we would expect to see in each case. A designer could arbitrarily generate anything, but what we observe is consistent with random sampling of an incremental process. 

&gt;(3) Genes and functional parts will be re-used in different unrelated organisms.

This is equally as strong, if not stronger, evidence for shared ancestry.

&gt;(4) The genetic code will NOT contain much discarded genetic baggage code or functionless ""junk DNA"".

Commented out code makes it into production software all the time, as do defunct parts that rarely or never get executed. We do find unused DNA within genomes, how much would you expect from a designer? How much would you expect from a sloppy designer? 


&gt;One need not fully understand the origin or identity of the designer to determine whether an object was designed.

I would disagree. Choices made by designers can be largely arbitrary. Without knowing the process by which a designer designs, or the preferences they use to evaluate their designs, it may be impossible to distinguish between their designs and a natural process. Just consider the vast variety of designs that humans have produced.

&gt; Thus, the question of the origin of the designer is irrelevant to whether we can detect design, the core focus of intelligent design theory.

Again, I would disagree. The behavior, motivations, goals, and preferences of the designer has a significant effect on the resulting designs. 

&gt; For example, if SETI were to detect a signal from an intelligent extra-terrestrial civilization, we would need not know how that life form arose to determine that there was indeed an intelligent entity that sent the signal.

SETI is a noble effort, but I have strong doubts that it will ever achieve its nominal goal for many of the same reasons I take issue with ID. We have already found ""designed"" signals that have turned out to be human-generated or generated by previously unknown natural phenomena. When humans transmit signals, we often augment them through encodings, compression, and/or encryption for various reasons, with the result often being indistinguishable (by design!) from random noise without the proper tools and knowledge to recover the original signal. 

&gt;See above. And if one needs to directly observe design, can one directly observe macroevolution? No. We observe microevolution, then extrapolate to macroevolution. In the same way, we can observe features of design and observe biological systems to see if they exhibit those features.

Again, these ""features of design"" are based on assumed aspects of the designer. We can infer macroevolution from observed microevolution because the process is consistent and predictable. Designers need not be. If they are, then the subject of science would be their design process, making the designer itself completely irrelevant. This doesn't touch the claim of unfalsifiability at all. No matter what we observe, it can be explained by a designer. This makes it useless.

&gt; But molecular clock estimates for the origin of metazoan lineages are at odds with the timing of appearance of metazoan phyla in the fossil record. While molecular clock estimates vary greatly, all estimates for the major divisions of the Metazoa (e.g., between bilaterians and deuterostomes) are all at least 55 Ma before the first unambiguous metazoan body fossils in the early Cambrian, and more than 25 Ma before the first multicellular animals in the Vendian (see Bromham and Hendy, 2000). Most molecular dates are one hundred million years or more before the Cambrian explosion.

[Microevolution vs. Macroevolution: The False Dichotomy](https://thelogicofscience.com/2015/02/09/microevolution-vs-macroevolution-the-false-dichotomy/)

Some highlights:

&gt; Even the most fervent and outspoken young earth creationism organizations acknowledge that natural selection is a real thing and causes the genetic makeup of populations to change. For example, everyone agrees that all dogs descended from a common ancestor, and creationists typically have no problems accepting that all of the species of Galapagos finches descended from a single species of finch that got blown out to the islands. So the disagreement between scientists and creationists is not about whether or not evolution occurs. Rather, it is about whether or not evolution has limits.

and...

&gt; Hopefully, at this point, the problem with creationists’ distinction is clear. Creationists would agree with every single individual step of this process. They would agree that Generation 2 evolved from Generation 1, Generation 3 evolved from generation 2, etc. all the way up to Generation 1,000 evolving from Generation 999, but they would simultaneously claim that it is not possible that Generation 1,000 evolved from Generation 1. This is a clear violation of the Law of Transitive Properties. If you acknowledge that each microevolutionary step will occur, then you have just acknowledged that macroevolution will occur, because macroevolution is nothing more than the product of multiple steps of microevolution. So the creationist claim that “microevolution occurs but macroevolution is impossible” is logically inconsistent, and it is totally arbitrary without any scientific reasoning behind it (i.e., it is an ad hoc fallacy).

This is another good article:

Creationists frequently misrepresent the theory, making claims and challenges like ""Show me a dog turning into a non-dog"" or worse ""Show me a single cell turning into a person"" or some variation. 

Look at a crowd of people and notice how they don't look exactly the same. Now realize that their children won't look the same as them or each other either.

The ""punctuated"" side represents the *events* of rather rapid evolutionary radiation and speciation.

Darwinism does not predict gradual change *alone*. Darwin himself did but that was 150 years ago. Why going back 150 years in time?

Even though it's more likely to be 10 million years, that would be equivalent to 0.6% of life's history.

&gt;First, in the immediate pre-Cambrian era, you have a LOT of genetic diversity. We know this is the case because coalesnce analysis places the common ancestors for many extant animal groups that appear as fossils during the Cambrian tens of millions of years earlier, meaning you had reproductive isolation and genetic diversification between the groups,

Seeing as this is a debate sub, I'll request a citation.

&gt; but either little morphological diversification, or they just didn't fossilize. Either way.

Considering embryos and plants have been fossilized, I somehow doubt that there are no fossilized precursors.

&gt;One of the big things that give us such a good picture of this in the fossil record is that many of the new traits involved mineralized body parts - shells, for example. Selection for these types of structures, both offensive and defensive, was probably driven by competition due to more than one lineage initially dispersing into similar niches, or due to additional niches created following the earlier diverge events. For example, a new species of primary consumer (herbivore) appears, which creates a new niche for a secondary consumer (carnivore), which allows for a tertiary consumer, and so on up.

Works for me, but does the fossil record reflect this?

&gt; Because of the sudden appearance of a near complete diversity of animal body plans in the fossil record around 530–520 million years ago, this diversification is commonly referred to as the “Cambrian explosion”.48, 49 Although there are disagreements as to the speed of this diversification,44 one thing that is clear is that since this time there have been only minor modifications to existing animal body plans (Fig. 3).

&gt;A designer does not solve any problems. Who designed the designer? If they always existed, you're asking scientists to insert what is effectively a god into their theories. Not gonna happen. Otherwise, you just push the problem back a bit to how they came to be.

One need not fully understand the origin or identity of the designer to determine whether an object was designed. Thus, the question of the origin of the designer is irrelevant to whether we can detect design, the core focus of intelligent design theory. For example, if SETI were to detect a signal from an intelligent extra-terrestrial civilization, we would need not know how that life form arose to determine that there was indeed an intelligent entity that sent the signal. The question of the origin of the designer may be an interesting question, but answering this question is irrelevant to whether we can detect design. 

&gt;It can't be falsified. A designer can do whatever they please, for whatever reason they can conceive. Directly observing the process of design and/or creation is the only way to verify one exists. Otherwise, this hypothesis can explain anything by claiming ""that's just what the designer decided to do"". Furthermore, you cannot make any predictions without knowing the exact mind of the designer and have no reason to assume consistency.

See above. And if one needs to directly observe design, can one directly observe macroevolution? No. We observe microevolution, then extrapolate to macroevolution. In the same way, we can observe features of design and observe biological systems to see if they exhibit those features.

 1. Design is a difficult thing to define. How do we distinguish between objects that were produced through a process and those produced by a designer? If you were shown an large number of designed/not designed pairs of (potentially foreign) objects, what rules would you use to choose the designed object in each pair? We can ""design"" things with genetic algorithms that end up looking a lot like things we see nature, and all we do is press ""Run"" on a process that iterates competition, reproduction, and variation. If there was a creator or designer, the evidence suggests that they have done something similar. Should we worry about who pressed ""Run"", or spend our time figuring the process that was started?

283,"The Cambrian explosion is only ""short"" from a geological perspective. In reality it was at least 10 millions or even 20 up to 30 millions years lasting, which represents about the same number of generations in the organisms of these days.

The emergence of many phyla, once considered to be Cambrian, is now found to be much older due to fossil finds. At least six of them previously thought to be Cambrian, are now found to have emerged earlier. Current state of affains concerning metazoan phyla: eleven of thirty-two appeared during the Cambrian, one appears Precambrian, eight after the Cambrian, and twelve have no fossil record. The latter testifies the incomplete fossil record still remains an issue.

The Cambrian is also the start of hard-bodied organisms, soft bodied ones ar emuch more difficult to find.

And most life in the pre-Cambrian was very small, even microscopic and thus hard to detect.

And that just considers phyla. Almost none of the animal groups that people think of as ""groups"", such as mammals, reptiles, birds, insects, land plants and spiders, appeared in the Cambrian. The fish that appeared in the Cambrian (jawless) was unlike any fish alive today. So most of the typical body plans we see today are post-Cambrian. 

Also other instances of rather massive and rapid evolution has been observed and established, making the Cambrian explosion rather an event among events and not so ""special"" anymore in its pace or extension. Basicalle every of the 6 mass extinction events are followed by ""Cambrian explosion"" like periods of rapid and extensive evolution.

The ""suddenness"" of the Cambrian explosion also was based on the utter lack of older fossil finds - creationists *still* think that. As if it came out of nowhere. But the pre-Cambrian fossils are now abundant and the Cambrian didn't start as a tabula rasa but with a considerable biodiversity:

- evidence of multicellular life up to 1.2 byo

- tracelike fossils more than 1,200 Mya 

- sponges older than the Cambrian

- Ediacaran biota older than the Cambrian

- algae older than the Cambrian

- transitional fossils within the Cambrian explosion fossils

- eukaryotes (which have relatively complex cells) may have arisen 2,700 Mya

- the split between archaea and bacteria

- cnidarians predate the Cambrian.

Still, the Cambrian was clearly an era of rapid and spectacular radiative speciation. Some considerations on top of what others here also (Snowball earth, oxygination of the atmosphere) mentioned:

1. the emergence of predation must have spurred coevolution and hence the pace of evolution. Especially the evolution of protective hard body parts could well explained this way.

2. the evolution of the first Hox genes.

3. changing chemical composition of the oceans have been observed at the base of the Cambrian, especially unusual amounts of phosphate were deposited as well as fecal pellets produced by planktonic grazers.

[Dover v. Kitzmiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District)

Where you'll find things like this in the decision:

&gt;The concept of intelligent design (hereinafter “ID”), in its current form, came into existence after the Edwards case was decided in 1987. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the religious nature of ID would be readily apparent to an objective observer, adult or child.

&gt;We initially note that John Haught, a theologian who testified as an expert witness for Plaintiffs and who has written extensively on the subject of evolution and religion, succinctly explained to the Court that the argument for ID is not a new scientific argument, but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer.

I agree with the sentiment, but they are a  bit different. In my opinion ID is worse. 

It's effectively a shapeshifting Trojan horse designed to sneak religious beliefs into science and particularly into schools.

Creationism is blunt and to the point. It's obviously a religious belief and no one could mistake it for anything else.

ID tries to be science. It preys on those with doubts about how evolution works, giving them a generic designer that they can replace with the god of their choice. It's a pseudoscientific choose-your-own-god-of-the-gaps ""theory"" that obfuscates discussion with meaningless and subjective terms and justification. It doesn't even have to be a divine designer anymore, proponents can easily avoid revealing their religious motivations and claim that we can't rule out that life was designed by some alien race or something.

Arguing with creationists is easy, because they have little to go on. ID takes all of the evidence for evolution and twists and manipulates it to appear to be evidence *against* evolution in a way that appears scientific and legitimate to those with a religious tendency. They are a huge pain in the ass to have any meaningful discussion with.

And I'm pretty sure this ""third way of evolution"" crap that's been popping up is little else than another repackaging of creationism after the failure of ID to achieve its goals.

&gt;intelligent design is not science, but merely creation science in disguise. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that creation science was a religious concept, not a scientific idea, and could not be mandated in public schools.

Early animals appeared to have evolved during this period, probably between a hundred million years up to even half a billion years before the Cambrian. However, they were limited in size and sophistication by the climactic conditions. Once the glaciers started to melt, we see a huge increase in biodiversity.  This seems to have started with the [Edicarian Biota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran_biota) about 60 million years before the Cambrian Explosion, continuing into the Cambrian period which lasted another 60 million years.  And the diversification didn't end at the end of the Cambrian, it continued into the Ordovician, with the common ancestors of many existing groups not appear until tens of millions of years after the end of the Cambrian. So overall we are talking about diversification over probably 160 million years or more, around two and a half times the period since the extinction of the dinosaurs.

What really changed in the Cambrian wasn't the evolution of animals, but rather the evolution of [hard skeletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion#Ediacaran.E2.80.93Early_Cambrian_skeletonisation). These first appeared towards the end of the Edicarian through the beginning of the Cambrian. This seems to have led to a massive arms race between different levels of predator and prey. Further, the earlier microbial mats that covered the sea floor were finally eaten up over the course of the Edicarian/Cambrian time period.  This meant the simple burrowing and grazing lifestyle of early animals was no longer an option in most cases, forcing animals into more complex, active feeding style in order to survive. 

The evolution of hard bodies appears to be the result of [chemical changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion#Increase_in_the_calcium_concentration_of_the_Cambrian_seawater) in the ocean, with increases in dissolved minerals used to make hard bodies.",3,1500403649,2017-07-18 14:47:29

336,"**Snowball Earth**

The Snowball Earth hypothesis proposes that Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen at least once, sometime earlier than 650 Mya (million years ago). Proponents of the hypothesis argue that it best explains sedimentary deposits generally regarded as of glacial origin at tropical palaeolatitudes and other enigmatic features in the geological record. Opponents of the hypothesis contest the implications of the geological evidence for global glaciation and the geophysical feasibility of an ice- or slush-covered ocean and emphasize the difficulty of escaping an all-frozen condition. A number of unanswered questions remain, including whether the Earth was a full snowball, or a ""slushball"" with a thin equatorial band of open (or seasonally open) water.

**Ediacaran biota**

The Ediacaran (; formerly Vendian) biota consisted of enigmatic tubular and frond-shaped, mostly sessile organisms that lived during the Ediacaran Period (ca. 635–542 Mya). Trace fossils of these organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex multicellular organisms. The Ediacaran biota radiated in an event called the Avalon explosion, 575 million years ago, after the Earth had thawed from the Cryogenian period's extensive glaciation.

342,"So we're talking about a 20-40 million year period during which a bunch of new body plans appear for the first time in the fossil record. 

Here's how it probably happened:

&amp;nbsp;

First, in the immediate pre-Cambrian era, you have a LOT of genetic diversity. We know this is the case because coalesnce analysis places the common ancestors for many extant animal groups that appear as fossils during the Cambrian tens of millions of years earlier, meaning you had reproductive isolation and genetic diversification between the groups, but either little morphological diversification, or they just didn't fossilize. Either way.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, we see fairly large-scale changes to the environment, which becomes more diverse. This means there are more ecological niches available.

&amp;nbsp;

Lots of genetic diversity plus lots of available niches is going to lead to rapid adaptive radiation - lots of new traits experiencing positive selection due to low competition in these new niches, which means the many lineages that are already reproductively isolated further diverge, become highly divergent ecologically and morphologically. 

&amp;nbsp;

One of the big things that give us such a good picture of this in the fossil record is that many of the new traits involved mineralized body parts - shells, for example. Selection for these types of structures, both offensive and defensive, was probably driven by competition due to more than one lineage initially dispersing into similar niches, or due to *additional* niches created following the earlier diverge events. For example, a new species of primary consumer (herbivore) appears, which creates a new niche for a secondary consumer (carnivore), which allows for a tertiary consumer, and so on up.

&amp;nbsp;

So to sum up, genetic diversity, a dynamic environment, and a positive feedback loop of ecological complexity. ",11,1500401724,2017-07-18 14:15:24

Young Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of the religious belief of creationism which holds that the universe, Earth, and all life on Earth were created by direct acts of God less than 10,000 years ago. Its primary adherents are Christians who subscribe to a literal interpretation of the creation narrative in the Bible's Book of Genesis and believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days. In contrast to YEC, old Earth creationism is the belief in a metaphorical interpretation of the Book of Genesis and the scientifically-determined estimated ages of the Earth and Universe.

Since the mid-20th century, young Earth creationists—starting with Henry Morris (1918–2006)—have devised and promoted a pseudoscientific explanation called ""creation science"" as a basis for a religious belief in a supernatural, geologically recent creation.

***

**Intelligent design**

Intelligent design (ID) is a religious argument for the existence of God. Presented by its proponents as ""an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins"", it has been found to be pseudoscience. Proponents claim that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection."" Educators, philosophers, and the scientific community have demonstrated that ID is a form of creationism which lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses.

Proponents argue that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science while conceding that they have yet to produce a scientific theory.

354,"&gt; Does it mean change over time? Does it mean descent with modification?

These are largely equivalent statements in the context of biology. The way life changes over time is though the modification and selection of descendents.

Unless you are talking about descent from a common ancestor, which is a hypothesis that can be reached by running this process backwards, noting hierarchical similarities in lifeforms, and the observation that it is unlikely for these similarities to have evolved separately in this particular pattern. I would not claim that descent from a common ancestor *is* evolution, but rather a conclusion that can be reached by applying evolutionary theory to observations.

&gt; Sometimes, people are actually talking about abiogenesis, not evolution.

Evolution in a biological context generally refers to the the process of selection and modification of living organisms with DNA. In a more general sense, evolution can refer to a process of iterative improvement according to some notion of quality. Abiogenesis likely involved *some* such process of selection and modification of molecules or molecular networks for various properties such as stability, ability to self-replicate, and information storage, but until we had the first modern-ish cell there was no evolution of the type discussed in this subreddit.

355,"&gt;So recently, I've seen a new alternative to conventional mutation and selection: someone I've talked too claimed that information in DNA is similar to crystals and fractal curves.

I have no idea how this is an ""alternative"" to mutation and selection. Could you expand on what you mean by this?

&gt; Is this plausible? Can order such as that in crystals account for genetic information?

There is actually very little ""information"" within crystal or fractal structures. Crystals are essentially repetition, the same pattern repeated over and over again. If you see one piece of a crystal, the vast majority of the rest is effectively copy/pasted. Fractals are more complex, but can often be generated by the repeated application of a simple rule. Instead of repeating mainly through space like crystals, fractals often repeat through scale.

&gt; Or is the conventional mutation and selection model better?

Mutation and selection are not even comparable to crystals or fractals. This is like comparing apples to dogs and asking which is better. Mutation is a source of random variation within genomes, and selection is an abstract label we use to talk about the observation that some things survive and others don't. Those that survive and reproduce are ""selected"", those that do not were not selected. In this sense, the conditions in which a living thing exists, its environment, can be thought of as selecting what lives and what dies, though this is not a conscious act such as when a human selects something. It's just the result of interactions between life and its environment.

When selection is coupled with variation, we can see directed trends towards organisms that are better adapted to their environment, which we call evolution. ",5,1500395368,2017-07-18 12:29:28

Those aren't mutually exclusive. ""Change over time"" is not exactly incorrect, but a too general statement, if you want to be pedantic. After all, something rusting is also a ""change over time"", and no one claims that's evolution.

So, if you want to make it more precise, you would have to add something.

As U/Mnementh2230 already pointed out ""Change *in allele frequency* over time"" adds the necessary distinction to be a good definition.

The descent with modification is how pretty much the *how* in ""Change in allele frequency over time"", so it just further specifies the definition, but at the cost of being the most compressed accurate version possible.

You can do this with pretty much any definition, there is a minimalist version that contains all the important, unifying elements of whatever you are defining, and based on the context you need the definition in, you may need to add additional precise info.

There is really no mystery or confusion here. 

Creationists seem to be the only ones who are confused, and that is understandable, because they don't understand the concept of evolution, so whenever they see definitions in slightly different contexts, they assume its something completely different.

They're wrong. I explained why:
&gt;They showed that treating the viruses as they replicated in cells caused the fitness to drop. But they could not document that this was specifically due to mutation accumulation over generations.

&gt;They also showed that if you hit the genomes with a lot of mutagen, they are less infective, and this is due to mutations. But it very specifically isn't due to mutation accumulation over generations.

&gt;So they did not demonstrate error catastrophe.

I don't really expect you to understand, or care, why the two parts of the experiment don't stack to demonstrate error catastrophe.

I'm not going to rehash our H1N1 discussion again, so I'll just say two quick things: Codon bias is a lousy proxy for fitness in RNA viruses, and you can't treat fitness in host-parasite relationships as one-dimensional.

392,"Hello Darwin my friend.  My first two paragraphs are in response to you.  Error catastrophe is a serious problem for evolutionary theory, and despite that the field of population genetics is nearly unanimous that yes, it is a real thing and that the mutational limit is in the low single digits.  Why should a creationist like me accept what leading evolutionists who study these things have all rejected?

Crotty et al. specifically say they demonstrated error catastrophe.  What other explanation is there?  You previously said the reduction in fitness was due to ""signaling pathways, energetics and metabolism, and biosynthesis"" but they ruled this out by testing them in an environment free of the ribavirin mutagen.  Do you now agree that the reduction in fitness was not due to these things?


On H1N1, as I said a loss of codon bias and decreasing pathogenicity are consistent with H1N1 fitness decline, but you did not address my main point.  If these mutations are adaptive, the longer that H1N1 remains in the human population the better adapted it should become.  However we see the ""extinction of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes.""  Why is this, unless fitness is declining?

&gt; Sanford’s Figure 15 is a redrawn version of Simonsen’s Figure 1. But the quantity graphed by Simonsen is not “pathogenicity” or “fitness,” as Sanford claims.

In Sanford's [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/) we are discussing there is no graph with an axis labeled ""pathogenicity"" or ""fitness,"" nor is there a figure 15.  I also have Sanford's book (which is very layman-oriented and not very technical), but there is no figure 15--the figures only go to 14.  Of those 14, none have anything to do with H1N1.  Maybe I have the wrong edition?

But yes I actually read Jellison's review just a few days ago.  Did you read Sanford's response to it?  There is much that Jellison got wrong.  I don't agree with all of Sanford's arguments but I find him more competent than most biologists.

On the slightly deleterious.  I'm specifically talking about of those 42 each generation that are deleterious, sorry I didn't clarify better.  The other 58 mutations each generation are potentially neutral.

All this transcription is from ""ancestral replication as some kind of mobile genetic element,"" why is it that we find:

1.  Transcription that is specific to cell type and developmental stage, even though the transcription commonly begins within these repetitive sequences.
2.  Transcripts are taken to specific locations within cells, 80% of the time, at least in the brain.
3.  When these are tested they usually end up functional.

On the rest you are still saying ""but they haven't been proven functional!""  I feel like you are especially resistant to extrapolation here. 
 Suppose I have a rock and I want to know if it is made of gold.  I sample from one end--gold.   Gold on the other end too.  Then I sample hundreds of points inside the rock and a solid majority are gold, but there's some lead mixed in.  I still have not sampled 90% of the points within the rock.

What is there to correct?  The deleterious rates are of course a subset of these numbers.

You say ""I don't believe I mentioned selection"" but we are talking about selection removing harmful mutations, so it's unavoidable.
As for ""that's &lt;2 per chromosome,"" if every individual has ~1 new deleterious mutation in every other chromosome, who does selection select to be more fit?

&gt; If a thing is truly redundant and there is no fitness cost for knocking out one of the copies, why are both constrained?

Probably because there hasn't been enough time since the organisms were created in order for enough mutations to accumulate.  Given evolution, how would unrelated, functional, redundant genes exist at all?  They should have been lost long ago because there is little to no selection to maintain them.

&gt; By what definition of ""functional""? Is there a fitness cost to losing it? Does it show signs of selection?

Sometimes, and sometimes.  Obviously I am not using selection to define function.  There is much more function than selection can maintain, so any such definition would be futile.

* It doesn't have ""a predetermined target.""  Have you used Mendel before?  It's free and open source.

Exactly. And if homologous LTRs are present in organisms that share a more distant common ancestor, there has been more time for mutations to accumulate. That's evidence for common ancestry, but independent of that, the fact that they accumulate mutations *at all* is an argument against their having a selected function.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The whole argument here is that there's far more DNA than what can be maintained by purifying selection.

And yet you've given no evidence to that effect. Also, there isn't going to be a constant value for that. It's, as always, dependent on genetic, biochemical, and ecological context.

400,"&gt;it's an argument of the gaps to say that only 10% of the human genome is functional, because that much has been studied so far.

Nope. We have strong evidence for function, that is, selected function, in about 10% of the genome. We have strong evidence *against* selected function in about 75% of the genome, and about 15% that is potentially in play. 

You can quote the same thing you already quoted, but it isn't less wrong the second time. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;About 80% of DNA is differentially transcribed. 

Okay. No news there. Most of the genome is derived from mobile genetic elements. They get transcribed a lot. 

&gt;So let's suppose 80% of that 80% is actually functional

Uh, let's not, unless you're sitting on a cache of evidence you haven't presented yet. 

Do you have anything else? Because we've done this dance before. None of this stuff is inconsistent with ancestral replication as some kind of mobile genetic element, which commonly use RNA secondary structures to regulate activity. The paper you cite has a bunch of *hypothetical* regulatory RNAs, but they don't demonstrate they are actually functional. 

That said, I'm sure there are a bunch of regulatory RNAs that we haven't found. 80% of our genome? No. Not when we already know what most of it is.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;most mutations are only slightly deleterious

You obviously don't care to be accurate. You've been corrected on this point multiple times. Not wasting my time on it again. ",1,1500332481,2017-07-17 19:01:21
401,"I think those first two paragraphs are in response to a different comment. They don't seem relevant to anything I said above. 

&amp;nbsp;

Crotty et al. showed that more mutations cause problems. Yes. They failed to show that treatment causes mutations to accumulate over generations while replicating in cells, as opposed to some other mechanism, or some combination of mechanisms. Obviously if you bombard viruses with mutagen, they are inactivated due to mutations. No news there. The question is whether the treatment induces error catastrophe, which is a subset of ""lethal mutagenesis."" They did not demonstrate that error catastrophe was occurring. 

&amp;nbsp;

Let me be very specific. They showed that treating the viruses as they replicated in cells caused the fitness to drop. But they could not document that this was specifically due to mutation accumulation over generations.

They also showed that if you hit the genomes with a lot of mutagen, they are less infective, and this *is* due to mutations. But it very specifically *isn't* due to mutation accumulation over generations. 

So they did not demonstrate error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

On Sanford, the key is ""weak selection on codon bias"" - what the paper I referenced demonstrated was that selection for optimal codon usage (which probably means ""matching the host,"" though there are exceptions) is *extremely* weak. Meaning there is very little cost, if any, to using codons at different frequencies from the host. Those mutations are, in the context of those populations, neutral - other alleles/genotypes/mutations are playing a much larger role in fitness, rendering codon bias moot as long as it adheres to some basic rules (like humans have to use ""rare arginine"" codons, for example). But aside from that stuff, synonymous sites are often under extremely relaxed selection. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, loss of virulence is very much *not* a good proxy for fitness, and H1N1 (and other flu strains) often *don't* accumulate mutations until they go extinct. They continue to circulate at low levels, often in non-human hosts. When a strain is replaced by a different one as the most common circulating strain, that new strain doesn't have ""fewer accumulated mutations""; it's simply more fit in the ecological and genetic context of a population that has acquired immunity to the previous strain. That's why pandemics tend to cycle - H1N1 in the 1880s, 1918, 1970s, and 2009, for example. As cohorts with acquired immunity die off, a sufficient fraction of people are susceptible and a pandemic is possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

And also Sanford massively distorted the work on influenza virulence that he uses to claim it's experiencing a fitness decline. Like, it's bad:

&gt;Sanford’s Figure 15 is a redrawn version of Simonsen’s Figure 1. But the quantity graphed by Simonsen is not “pathogenicity” or “fitness,” as Sanford claims. Rather, the figure shows a ratio: the number of influenza-caused deaths of people under 65, divided by the total number of deaths. The point of the paper is that the flu epidemic of 1918-1919 was unusual in that it killed mostly young people. The authors studied how this ratio varied with time, and modeled the results in terms of different immunity in the two age cohorts.

&gt;Thus, the curves in Sanford’s plot merely show that, as time goes on, flu strains kill a greater proportion of elderly people. This makes sense, since young people have more vigorous immune systems. The ratio data tells us nothing about the “fitness” of the virus. Sanford’s Figure 15 is bogus.

405,"Hey Darwin, yet again this is another point where I don't think there is a single evolution-loving population geneticist who would agree with you that mammals are better at removing deleterious mutations than microbes.  You are basically rejecting the last 60+ years of theoretical population genetics literature.  Haldane, Kimura, Lynch in my quote above, all of it.  But there are a lot of good reasons to agree with them:

* As discussed in my part 2 response, the mammal total genome mutation rate is 100 times higher than viruses, and the mammal deleterious mutation rate is about 40 times higher than viruses.

* Being diploid only buffers the decline, it doesn't actually change the rate.

* Sexual recombination certainly helps versus having a 3 billion bp haploid genome.  But recombination only occurs once or twice per chromosome per reproduction.  Each one of these linked blocks is 1000s of times longer than an RNA virus, which still makes selection much weaker because you have 1000s of times more mutations hitchhiking together.  It takes thousands of years to sort out short blocks, and in that time to remove one bad mutation you have accumulated tens of thousands more.

* Humans and most mammals also have much smaller population sizes than RNA viruses.  This too makes selection weaker, because with less trials, random chance plays a greater role in survival than genotype.

* Unlike RNA viruses, mammals don't produce hundreds of copies of themselves, meaning selection has less to work with.

* Mammals also have 300,000 times more DNA than your average RNA virus, which makes the selective effect of each mutation thousands of times less than in viruses.  This too makes selection far weaker in mammals.

So I think the evidence for weaker selection in mammals is overwhelming.  But even if I ignore this grant everything you're saying, I don't see how it sense even in your own worldview:  If selection is stronger in mammal genomes than in RNA viruses, then why are the RNA virus genomes highly optimized, and mammal genomes mostly unconstrained junk, as you say?

This is why Michael Lynch, one of the most prominent population geneticists today, [says](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/450.full) ""all lines of evidence point to the fact that the efficiency of selection is greatly reduced in eukaryotes to a degree that depends on organism size.""  Viruses would be even further to the left of the simplest eukaryotes.",1,1500322145,2017-07-17 16:09:05
406,"Hey Darwin.  We both agree that RNA viral genomes are more constrained than mammal genomes.  Most RNA viruses get around 1 mutation per replication, while mammals get 100 mutations per generation.  Yes viruses are the ""fastest mutating organisms on earth"" if you are talking about the *per nucleotide* rate, but not in terms of total genome, which is the part that matters for our calculations here.  When you talk about this I wish you could clarify here because otherwise people get the wrong idea.

So once we have the total mutations per genome, we can calculate how many are deleterious.  As we've discussed before, it's an argument of the gaps to say that only 10% of the human genome is functional, because that much has been studied so far.  As I [shared before](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/):  ""In fact almost every time you functionally test a non-coding RNA that looks interesting because it's differentially expressed in one system or another, you get functionally indicative data coming out.""

About 80% of DNA is differentially transcribed.  In that same article we're told that 80% of transcripts in the brain are taken to specific locations within cells.  So let's suppose 80% of that 80% is actually functional, which gives us 64%.  How much of that DNA has a specific sequence?  Take a look at [figure 5](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/10/03/gr.112516.110.full.pdf) in this paper, at the RNA diagrams.  You can count that 372 of the 566 RNA nucleotides (66%) are cross-linked, indicating at least that many require a specific sequence.  If we multiply that 66% by the 64% that gives us at least 42% of DNA having a specific sequence.  This is consistent with the independent evidence from GWAS studies showing that 95% of disease and trait altering SNPs are outside of protein coding genes.

Having 42% of the genome being specific in sequence gives us about 42 harmful mutations per generation.  We have two copies of each gene, even haploid mammal genomes are highly redundant, and most mutations are only slightly deleterious, so the detrimental effect of this is greatly buffered, and hence it takes a very long time and is difficult to observe decline in mammals.  But since the process is a net decline, evolution could not have created our genomes.

407,"Darwin my friend, I do not think there is a single person publishing in population genetics who would agree with you that genomes can tolerate more than a few mutations per generation.  This has been worked out mathematically and in simulations for more than 50 years now by evolution-affirming biologists, the majority atheists.  Kimura, Thomas Jukes, David Comings, Ohno, Doolittle, Felsenstein, Dan Graur, and T. Ryan Gregory for example.  John Sanford has [iteratively simulated this](http://robertmarks.org/REPRINTS/BINP/9789814508728_0010.pdf) in great detail, which of course includes taking recombination into account.  It's so bad that some people like Jody Hey actually re-normalize fitness in their simulations, to make ""sick the new healthy.""

Just three days ago Larry Moran [wrote](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2017/07/revisiting-genetic-load-argument-with.html):  ""about one deleterious mutation per generation is the limit that a population can tolerate... it's unlikely to be more than 1.5.""  I am actually in the minority by thinking it can be a little higher.

On [Crotty 2001](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6895.full.pdf):  The authors actually addressed your concern that ribavirin was decreasing fitness through ways other than mutation.  They concluded:  ""The loss of titer [viral concentration] could be because of inhibition of other virus processes... Here we have now carried out experiments designed to prove that lethal mutagenesis is the mechanism of action of ribavirin... the full antiviral effect of ribavirin can be attributed to lethal mutagenesis of the viral genetic material.""  They did this by isolating the mutated viruses and measuring how fast they replicated in HeLa cells.  More mutations = less replication.

On [Sanford 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/):  You say ""They mutate too fast for the weak selection on codon bias to compensate,"" well yes.  The idea behind error catastrophe is they mutate too fast for selection to compensate *everywhere*, and codon bias is one subset of this.  That's why that data point is compatible with error catastrophe.  Loss of virulence was also such a datapoint, although there could also be selection for less virulence.  However the main point is that H1N1 strains accumulate mutations (in all directions, not converging on any new phenotype) until they goes extinct, and they are replaced by other strains with fewer accumulated mutations.

So I do think these two papers are good demonstrations of error catastrophe, consistent with what the models and simulations have long predicted.

408,"Part 5.

&gt;I also disagree that a mutation ""doesn't count"" unless it makes it's carrier have fewer children. Random factors have a much greater effect on how many kids you'll have than a mutation that makes you only 99.9% as strong or as disease resistant as you'd otherwise be. Those with the worst mutations are always selected away. But most mutations have only very small harmful effects and the whole population gradually accumulates them. This has been rigorously modeled in computer simulation.

You can disagree, but that's literally the definition of ""deleterious"". Fitness effects are context-dependent and based on the effects on reproductive success. If a mutation doesn't affect fitness, it is neutral, period. If it *does* affect fitness, then selection can remove it. You can't have it both ways. 

Remember: All models are wrong. Some are useful. (Mendel's Accountant is not.)",1,1500319501,2017-07-17 15:25:01

&gt;It doesn't make sense to argue that only a low single digit percentage of human DNA is subject to harmful mutations. We [find that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2905358/) ""In fact almost every time you functionally test a non-coding RNA that looks interesting because it's differentially expressed in one system or another, you get functionally indicative data coming out."" At least 80% of RNA is differentially expressed (ENCODE) and a majority of the nucleotides within these sequences must be specific.

Sigh. ENCODE's silly estimate again. Biochemical activity is not function. If activity (transcription, protein-binding, etc) is the standard, the whole genome is functional, since it's all replicated. This standard is especially silly considering most of the human genome originated from retroviruses and retrotransposons - mobile genetic elements that experience, surprise! transcription and protein binding. The activity we see is much more likely to be a remnant of their ancestral replication activities than selected functions within the human genome. 

That work also did not demonstrate that these transcribed or protein-binding regions have been selected to do what they do, or are presently under selection to maintain what they do. In fact, we often see signs of the opposite. For example, LTRs that are older tend to be more degenerate, and often shorter, than those that are newer (i.e. integrated more recently). If they did something, selection should preserve them, rather than allowing them to accumulate mutations and experience deletions. 

Also, ""must be specific""? Evidence please. Signs of purifying selection? Fitness loss associated with knock-out? Anything?",1,1500319275,2017-07-17 15:21:15
410,"Part 3.

&gt;Because [a virus](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541) with an average of 2.6 harmful mutations per generation didn't decline in fitness, that doesn't mean genetic entropy in animals is nonesense. First see my previous point. But viruses also make hundreds of copies of themselves. That's enough that on average some copies will have 0 new harmful mutations and others will have 5 or more. I can work this out with the Poisson distribution if you'd like. But most mammals don't have this way out.

Mammals have a lower mutation rate, lower proportion of constrained sites, sexual recombination, and diploid. So in addition to have very few deleterious mutations per generation, mammals are better at clearing them compared to viruses. And the point of error catastrophe is that they must accumulate. Sexual reproduction and diploidy prevent deleterious mutations from accumulating. ",1,1500318845,2017-07-17 15:14:05
411,"Part 2.

&gt;It doesn't make sense that humans are less prone to error catastrophe than viruses. Humans get more harmful mutations per generation, and selection is far far weaker in a complex organism to weed them out. Michael Lynch (leading pop geneticist) has [a paper on](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/23/2/450/1119102/The-Origins-of-Eukaryotic-Gene-Structure) this: ""the efficiency of natural selection declines dramatically between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and multicellular eukaryotes."" Lynch then goes into the reasons.

...Yes, it does, for the very simple reason that human genomes have a lower frequency of sequence-constrained sites compared to RNA and ssDNA viral genomes. 

Let's compare.

&amp;nbsp;

[Meet phiX174.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Genome_map_of_the_bacteriophage_%CE%A6X174_showing_overlapping_genes.svg/800px-Genome_map_of_the_bacteriophage_%CE%A6X174_showing_overlapping_genes.svg.png) Its genome is about 5.4kb and encodes 11 genes. As you can see, those genes occupy almost the entire genome; the intergenic regions are tiny, and some of its reading frames actually overlap, so you don't even have wobble sites in some place (within the K and B genes. specifically). So most of this genome is sequence-constrained. That's not to say that every mutation will be deleterious, but a higher frequency ought to be compared to...

&amp;nbsp;

..The human genome: About 3 billion base pairs, only 2% protein-coding, and a further 8% or so with a documented function, most of which is *not* tightly constrained. Let's be conservative and say half the genome is ERVs, pseudogenes, LTRs, etc (it's quite a bit more, but we're being conservative), stuff that's pretty uncontroversially not playing a role in human cellular physiology. We're looking at way way way under half the genome as sequence-constrained here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Add to that a much lower mutation rate, by several orders of magnitude, for eukaryotes. [See figure 2 \(PDF\).](http://www.origem.info/FIC/pdf/Duffy%20et%20al%20Rates%20of%20Evol%20Change_Nat%20Rev%20Gen08.pdf) Eukaryotes are ~10^-9. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've actually tried to do error catastrophe on phiX174. I could kill them, but like the other studies on the topic, I couldn't demonstrate conclusively that the extinction was due specifically to error catastrophe. (Though I did show the expected decline in viability over generations, which was something). Comparing that genome and its mutation rate to the human genome and mutation rate, and keeping in mind I elevated the viral rate further, is it reasonable to think humans are experiencing error catastrophe *without* some exogenous source of mutations, or that we're even capable of it in theory? No. It's a ludicrous idea, completely without merit. ",1,1500318528,2017-07-17 15:08:48
412,"Part 1.

&gt;It's not true that error catastrophe has never been observed. We've seen it [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6895.full.pdf) or [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/). The fact that species will go extinct from too many mutations is [widely acknowledged](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions/#2-Genetic-load) and non-controversial.

Ah, good ol' Crotty 2001. There are several reasons why you can't take that as evidence of error catastrophe. First, because they use a nucleoside analog as their mutagen, it's probably doing more than causing mutations. It's going to mess with signaling pathways, energetics and metabolism, and biosynthesis. See [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16287208) for an overview of these possible mechanisms. 

Second, they don't demonstrate that the *accumulation of mutations over generations* is causing the observed outcome. They just show treatment with mutagen followed by loss of infectivity. Duh. Error catastrophe is a very specific situation of population genetics. Dropping a bunch of mutations into a genome and then showing that the *isolated genomes* are less infective is a different thing. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second paper is Sanfords terrible influenza paper. The primary reason this is wrong is that [you can't use codon bias as a measure of fitness in RNA viruses.](http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/5/1/162/htm) They mutate too fast for the weak selection on codon bias to compensate. So rather than move towards some optimal codon usage profile, they hover at the boundary of an acceptable codon usage profile. 

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, everyone agrees too many mutations will kill a thing. But the specific thing called error catastrophe? That's not something we've demonstrated. ",1,1500317310,2017-07-17 14:48:30

This is largely due to the body being decomposed and eaten by other lifeforms. Without other life consuming the rather large amount of potential energy stored within the corpse to perform their own act of ""resisting entropy"", the corpse would be largely unchanged beyond some basic chemical and physical process such as the evaporation of moisture and the effects of radiation.

&gt; wouldn't the speed with which the order is lost be an indicator of how successfully the system in question is fighting entropy

If you wish to use ""fighting entropy"" as a measure of stability then I guess, sort of. A suitable analogy would be a solid piston. This exerts work upon the surroundings and may continue like this for a period of years. We could easily imagine a low friction system where the piston would gradually heat up until it actually melts and forms a higher entropy liquid. Would you describe this as fighting entropy better than another piston which melted in a few days? If you are measuring the stability of the system by that metric then a piston could do far more work than a person, resist entropy for a longer period and begin in a lower entropy state.

Seems to me that persons do not exist...

The difficulty experienced by biologist to provide one compresive definition of species is indeed due to the extremely diversification of life. It is not caused by incompetence or failing theories like evolution. 

The same thing can be observed in the fossil record. Say we find a fossil of some half ape / half human individual. Say, a specimen of an early Homo erectus. Does this individual belong to the hominids (the human-like species)? Or was it a pithecus (ape-like)? Creationists just can't make up their minds. Some say it surely must be a human because it already had a body plan that much resembled humans and they fabricated tools. Others find [the ~600-800 cc brain case volume](http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/Homo_erectus_new.JPG) a bit awkward, that can't be from a real human, so those say it was an ape. 

Frankly, paleontologists and taxonomists also quarrel a lot about such fossil finds. But after a lot of hustle and bustle they arrived at the conclusion Homo erectus was a hominid, not a pithecus. The reason for this verdict was that Homo erectus fabricated tools and its body configuration indeed much resembled humans. So an important criterion is ""not only using tools nut also fabricating them"". That makes sense. But let''s take chimps. Chimps use twigs to catch ants - one of their favorite meals - by sticking those into ant nests. But this needs to rip off the twigs of their leaves. And *that* is fabricating a tool. 

These blurry differences that often make classifying fossils extremely difficult, is the hallmark of gradual evolution. It is exactly what to expect when evolutionary processes are acting.",3,1500290138,2017-07-17 07:15:38

427,"&gt; I ultimately disagree with you but that's not the point of this post.

As we all know, Islam is virtually absent in science since the 13th century. You can say that the Mongol raid on Islamic caliphates in the early 13th century, especially the one on Baghdad in 1258 (if I racall well) played an important role and surely it does but after that disaster Islamic rule and culture have been firmly re-established and since then the contribution to modern science is close to nothing.

Astoninshing when taken into account that today many Muslims consider the Qu'ran to be ""the most perfect book ever written"". One would expect a little bit more output from a religion that allegedly is built around the most perfect book ever written, especially in the realm of science. Has your faith been radicalized and become fundamentalistic since the 1250's as you mentioned this to be the crucial point where science and religion contradict?

Because in my opinion science and religion DO contradict and I think it's the very gist of our discussion - hence I see no reason to halt here. And the reason why often *in practice* science is not restricted and hindered by religion is when society is secularized, that is, when the state and church are separated (enough) and there is sufficient distance arranged between education and religion. Because when state and church are separated, the state (or, in 13th century Europe, the cities) will found universities and guarantee independent education. When state and church are not separated, especially when on top of that religion is dominant and permeating and controling all of society, there is no room for science to employ. That is exactly what we observe in medieval Europe and the Islamic world today.

In other words, the distinction fundamentalism - non-fundamentalism is not the crucial point, but the question whether state and church are separated or not. Keeping religion out of scientific and educational business is the thing that really counts.

The Abrahamistic religions, with their untenable claim of eternal and absolute truth by the one and only real god, who is thought to be ominiscient and ominipotent - which further adds to absolutistic claims, ultimately retrieved from obsolete, Bronze Age mythologies of some random semi-nomadic, Middle-East tribes, do not differ that much in their overall theological implications. As history and current observations point out to, they all have the intrinsic tendency to establish theocracies and fundamentalism. Fundamentalism *IS* the hallmark of *any* thought system that claims eternal truth.

The only thing to master this, is to put religion in containment - a separate, social institution where they can stare all day in their Bronze Age mythology books and perform ceremonies - not or least as possible hindering other parts of society.

&gt; ""On the other hand, Jesus mythicism is so fringe that nearly zero atheist historians take it seriously."" Not true, again. 

Your source is from a student.  Here is Richard Carrier, the leading Jesus mythicist, [at 3:28](http://www.premierradio.org.uk/listen/ondemand.aspx?mediaid={4D88EAB4-474E-4338-B8B4-7B7AD0410B24}) in the interview:  ""The overwhelming consensus is that Jesus existed, and usually as a historian you would just presume history.""  Or [Bart Ehrman](http://youtu.be/yRx0N4GF0AY?t=0m36s) who is agnostic and argues against Christianity, in 2009 before Carrier became well known: ""I don't know any serious historian that doubts the existence of Jesus""

Your own source lists 236 biologists in relevant fields on the DI's list.  The ID biologists I've met in real life (just through random encounters, not conferences or what not) either won't sign it because they would lose their jobs if they did, or they don't know the list exists.  So Jesus mythicism does not compare to creation biology.

But let's talk about actual evidence that Jesus existed.

1. Jesus mythicists often say Paul, who is our earliest source on Jesus and whose writings, that Paul only had visions of Jesus as a cosmic being, and did not believe that he was a real person on earth.  But Paul says Jesus was ""born of a woman, born under the law"" (Gal 4:4), was ""a descendant of David with reference to the flesh"" (Rom 1:3) was executed by earthly rulers ""the rulers of this age... crucified the Lord of glory"" (1 Cor 2:8) and that ""Christ died"" and ""was buried"" (1 Cor 15:3-4). Paul says he met with ""James, the Lord's brother""--an earthly, physical brother of Jesus and mentions ""The Lord's brothers"" (1 Cor 9:5) in the middle of a list of other real people like ""the other apostles"" and ""Cephas"". Paul says ""the Jews... killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets"" (1 Thess 2:14-15), which makes no sense if Jesus was a cosmic being that Paul only encountered in visions of heaven.

2.  In addition to Pauls many letters, within about 100 years Jesus is reported by Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Josephus, Peter, Barnabas, 1 Celment, the Didache, Mara-Bar Sarapion, Papius, Ignatius, Polycarp, Pliny, Tacitus, and Seutonius.  According to Bart Ehrman again, ""we have more evidence for Jesus than just about anybody from his time period."" (http://youtu.be/yRx0N4GF0AY?t=4m22s)

3.  Before Christianity no Jews whatsoever thought there would be a messiah who was crucified, they expected a figure of grandeur and power that overthrew the enemy.  An invented messiah would be like that.  Why didn't the Christians?  Because they knew Jesus was crucified and they didn't invent Jesus.

4.  The gospels are full of undesigned coincidences. Multiple sources give us pieces that only make sense when put together--a pattern we find in authentic testimony but not fabrications. E.g. How did Matthew and Mark know what happened to John the Baptist in Herod's household? Because Luke 8:3 tells us ""Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household"" was a follower of Jesus.  Likewise in John 6:5 why does Jesus ask Philip (almost never mentioned otherwise) where to get bread?  Luke 9:10 tells us they were near Bethsaida, and John 1:44 tells us Philip was from Bethsaida.  If it's all made up, why do these patterns exist?

5. The criteria of embarrassment. If something casts negative light on an author or his friends, but the author tells us anyway it's probably true, while embellishments and fabrications typically display people (the authors and their associates) in a positive light focusing on their triumphs.   In the NT we're told the Jews said Jesus was demon possessed and later that the body was stolen. Paul had a murderous past, Jesus's mother and brothers thought he was crazy, women as the first witnesses to the resurrection, Peter denied, Nicodemus and John the Baptist doubted, the disciples abandoned Jesus in fear, and then he was flogged and crucified--the most humiliating death of all.

6. James, the brother of Jesus, was a skeptic during Jesus's life. Paul hunted and killed Christians. But both became Christians and died as martyrs refusing to recant after encountering the risen Christ. Nearly all the other disciples met the same fate for the same reason. The gullible make good martyrs but liars do not; if they had fabricated it's expected they'd recant to save themselves.

7. There's little motive for fabrication--Jesus's followers lived under poverty and persecution. None of the three categories of motives (power, wealth, and sexual gain) fit. Mohammad and Joseph Smith used religion to gain all three.

8. If you give too many details of a falsehood's time, places, and people involved, it can easily be disproved. But the NT is full of very public claims that went unchallenged. ""God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it."", as Peter addressed the Jerusalem crowd in Acts 2.  Likewise you don't list famous people like Joseph of Arimathea, Pilate, or Herod in made-up stories, because everyone knows them (or their relatives/friends) and could go back and use them for fact-checking.

9.  If Jesus was invented, why fabricate him being from backwoods Nazareth (of no prophetic significance) and then go to all the trouble of inventing a census so he could have been born in Bethlehem, as prophecised in the Old Testament?  The only thing that makes sense is that Nazareth is an actual, historical element, and it's where Jesus really was from.  If Jesus was made up, why did they call him ""Jesus of Nazareth"" instead of ""Jesus of Bethlehem"" in order to match prophecy?

10.  There is no trace of an ""early, original"" form of Chrisianity that didn't believe in a literal Jesus, as required by all the various versions of the Jesus myth.  The Gnostics branches of Christianity, who embellished the various spiritual/mystical aspects, would have loved an emissary of a purely spiritual nature.  But they always say he was an actual first century teacher and only had the illusion of flesh.  The only reasonable explanation is the gonstics couldn't deny that's people saw and heard, nor did they have any tradition of mythicism to draw on.

11.  Likewise, every single last source that mentions Jesus up until the 1700s assumed Jesus actually existed.  That's true through the renaissance, the middle ages, late antiquity, and all the hundreds of sources going all the way back to the first century.  It's true of every Jewish, pagan, or otherwise antagonist who attacked Christianity with long lists of scandalous accusations--there's no record of any ever entertaining the idea that maybe Jesus never existed, or that they ever heard of anyone who had.  Jesus mythicism is a modern invention.

This is the same criteria we use to evaluate all other history.  Rejecting it would leave our ancient history books blank.  The washington post article is full of data that most atheist historians would laugh at, like ""only Roman scholar Josephus and historian Tacitus having any reasonable claim to be writing about Jesus within 100 years of his life.""",1,1500259789,2017-07-16 22:49:49

We're not debating religion. I'm pointing out that your premise has no evidence. How can there be evidence of something that cannot even be falsified? No body found, resurrected!

That's still a small minority (see project Steve) but most of the biology creation phd's I know of are not on that list, so extrapolating from that would get you into the thousands.

And, again, you are arguing against a point not made. You claimed there were thousands of *biologists* who affirm creation. The DI's ""Dissent from Darwin"" is a joke; most of the people on it are not biologists nor in a field related to biology. And some biologists on the list were duped and requested to have their names removed, and DI refuses.

443,"First, crystals (and any other stable structure) may not heal or reproduce, but still ""resist entropy"" by your definition. I am not seeing how healing or reproducing is relevant.

Second, to some extent some crystals can heal or reproduce in a sense. A crystal of some material, even a tiny bit broken off, can incorporate non-crystaline versions of the same material (for example in a solution) to grow. So even if we grant that healing and reproducing is relevant, you need to explain why the same principles don't apply to crystals.

Third, even if we grant you both, what would the implications of this be? There are lots of different ways for entropy to increase, decrease, or stay the same. There are mode of entropy increase that are unique to stars, others unique to neutrons starts, modes of entropy staying the same that are unique to a vacuum, others unique to brown dwarfs, modes of entropy decrease unique to crystals, others unique to solutions. So I don't see how having a unique form of entropy trajectory is so significant that it puts life in some special position compared to all the other types of structures with a unique form of entropy trajectory.",1,1500255075,2017-07-16 21:31:15

I did not get it from *Cosmos* but other sources. I beg to differ with the Reddit source and there's considerable disagreement among historians as to what role his cosmological thinking played in his conviction by the church. Despite Copernicus, most of the catholics in Bruno's times still were strongly subscribing to the geocentricist worldview.

The archives of the Vatican note:

&gt; In the same rooms where Giordano Bruno was questioned, for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith, at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of Aristotle's philosophy, sixteen years later, Cardinal Bellarmino, who then contested Bruno's heretical theses, summoned Galileo Galilei, who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial, which, luckily for him, ended with a simple abjuration.

And these words come from the mouth of the lion himself.

&gt; And on another note as a Muslim I would disagree that science/religion are in conflict(after all the Islamic golden age so many scientist who were devout Muslims, and made numerous advances). It's fundamentalist who are the main problem. Don't forget that Newton, Descartes, Leibniz etc were also devoutly theistic as well.

You make the huge mistake to conflate religion and believers. Next, [religion and science DO conflict](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6nb3v7/is_there_a_paradigm_change_occurring_with_regards/dkb1bqs/). And [now you were talking about deGrasse Tyson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl1nJC3lvFs). 

When Copernicus was formulating heliocentrism, he had no idea what exactly was holding the whole constellation of the solar system (in these days coinciding with the whole of the cosmos) together. So he, as a catholic canon, invoked, ""must be the divine hand of god"". A century later Newton found out that the constellation and motion of the planets, now orbiting the sun instead of the other way round - progression made in refuting the obsolete religious notions, could be explained by the laws of gravitation and motion. But his math only managed to calculate such gravitational induced motions for two objects solely. Calculating the whole constellation still was a bit too far fetched. So, Newton again invoked god and his divine hand to get rid of his scientific headache. Until a century later Laplace used some more advanced geometrical math and basically finished the job. Laplace also was among the first ones who came to realize that invoking god all the time is not a good idea and actually clogging the doorway to better understanding. When you fill up the existing gap science is unable to fill with ""god"", you frustrate better, future understanding. It is called the god of the gaps. The ever retreating gaps, that is.

In the meantime we arrived anno 2017 at explaining the origin of the cosmos by the big bang theory. And of course  as always there is a gap, which now is ""what caused the big bang in the first place"". And of course the theists come trotting from all directions like chickens with the speed of light, clucking ""must be god"".

448,"&gt; I never said there were no RNA viruses before 50k years ago. 

Was difficult to conclude of what you wrote, but OK, good to hear we agree on that.

&gt; Bless you and your CAPS LOCK key.

I'll tell him but I can't garantee it will render any reply... He says that rendering replies is up the the Enter key. Can't argue with that...

&gt; If RNA viruses mutate so quickly that all present day RNA viruses would share a common ancestor ~50k years ago, how did a bornavirus teleport 93 million years back in time to insert itself into the common ancestor of all mammals? This is the problem with assuming all ERVs come from exogenous viruses.

Who knows. Research is ongoing. The article you referred to already sets out some posibilities and suggests further research. Of course *that* part of the article you were ignoring.

But we have some pesky *observations* to cope with:

First of all, ERVS *are* retrovirus infections: 

- we *know* exactly how LTRs are formed. They are formed in the process of reverse transcription from RNA to DNA. If an ERV exists and it is flanked by LTRs then it is the result of an infection;

- the same goes for solo LTRs - these sequences once flanked ERVs. Their mere existence indicates that they were once encoded by RNA and that an ERV infection happened at such sites; 

- many ERVs have so called Target Site Repeats - another clear indication of an insertion event; 

- we have [actually managed to resurrect one](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/12/1548.long) of these from sequences of mutated HERV-K ERVs found in our genome and turn it into a functioning retrovirus; 

- they show a [clear and umambiguous viral codon bias](http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/08892220252779674); 

- many ERVs resemble retroviruses to the extent that they can be traced back to at least thre types of retroviruses. 

If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it most likely *is* a duck. The hallmark of a viral insertion is a displacement of chromosomal DNA, and the hallmark of insertion by integrase is the presence of target site duplication, due to the way it attacks the 5' and 3' phosphodiester bonds with an offset of a few base pairs. Since full-length ERVs are accompanied by target site duplications and DNA displacement, they are *necessarily* endogenized/fixed proviral insertions.

The second observation is that the very same ERVs are found on exactly the same loci in the genome of different species. As ERVs are the remnants of former retrovirus infections in germ cells, this directly proves common ancestry.

The third observation is that *not all* ERVs are shared by species. These non-shared ERVs increase with the phylogenetic distance of the species compared, as measured by DNA resemblance. This is exactly to be expected when evolution acts because after their split, each of the two sub-populations that once formed one species, are now genetically isolated and start to accumulate their own set of mutations.

The fourth observation is all shared ERVs occur in hierarchical subsets of the whole. Each set falls within another set, giving an unbroken line of inheritance for every species. This pattern is called a nested hierarchy. These patterns further corroborate that the many species of primates share common ancestry, and necessitate a specific sequence of divergence from one ancestral species to the next. They are wholly inexplicable by the model of uncommon ancestry.

The fifth observation is that once endogenized, the two LTRs start accumulating mutations. Any mutations to one LTR become quite apparent, as they are not accompanied by the same mutations in the other. Thus each mutation causes the ratio of discontinuity between the two LTRs of a full-length ERV to increase. Since ERVs in identical loci among greater numbers species of wider taxonomic separation correlate to older insertions, if the evolutionary model is correct, they should also have higher ratios of discontinuity between their LTRs. And what do we find? We find just that.

The sixth observation is that the mutations *themselves* within shared ERVs are found to be highly identical to others in distribution. And just as with the distribution of ERVs, shared mutations within a single shared ERV fall into nested hierarchies; some are shared by all, many by subsets of the whole, and each set falls within another set. Many of these nested hierarchies of mutations match those of distribution. Part of what makes this such powerful evidence for the evolutionary model is that ERV distribution and mutations rely on entirely different mechanisms; the function of integrase and the DNA replication complex, respectively. That such two nested hierarchies match at all is only explicable by common ancestry. 

The seventh observation is that not only ERVs are shared in nested hierarchy among different species - also other transposable elements show the same match between species in their distribution within the genomes. One of those transposable elements is Alu. Alus are small fragments of DNA that are identical but you will find up to 1 million of them accumulated in mammal genomes. The reason for that is because they tend to make copies from themselves that are randomly inserted on some arbritary locus elsewhere in the genome. They have no known function because of their particular, nonsensical nucleotide sequence but even when some of them would have found a job somewhere, 1 million minus a few copies of Alus still are unemployed - their sheer numbers tell that they are basically junk.

So, lets examine why Alus are such powerful evidence of common descent.  As mentioned, when Alus mobilize they deposit a copy of themselves at a random location in the genome.  This means that when an Alu is looking for a place to put a new copy, it has ~3 billion places to choose from - in between any two basepairs in the genome.  The chances of that same location being the home for an Alu in a chimp or gorilla or a monkey or any other primate is essentially 1 out of 3 billion, already pretty small.  But thousands of Alus shared by species on the same loci simply excludes this having happened by sheer random chance.

And as we know, Alus are not exogenous like ERVs but vehicles of the species' genome itself.

Now, some have suggested that ERVs were the *source* of retroviruses instead of ERVs having emerged from retovirus infections.

Well, in the first place it is *very* hard to imagine that an organism would produce infectuous agents that got released in the environment and subsequently cause often fatal diseases as retroviruses do, among those, for instance, HIV, which is a retrovirus. 

Secondly, it is hard to imagine how the very specific RNA insertion functionality common to retroviruses - that has no known functions for eukaryote cell processes, comprising at least 3 viral genes, would have been formed by those eukaryote organisms. Organisms just *won't* evolve *genes* that have no function (let alone deleterious ones). It defies all genetics.

Thirdly, this ""scenario"" STILL does not explain the observations 2-7 and only weakly observation 1. For instance, when ERVs originated from DNA sequences, once native to the species'' genomes where we find them, later infected other organisms, it is still completely incomprehensible how they appear on the very same spots on the genomes of different species, covered with the very same mutation patterns, exactly matching the phylogenetic distances between those species. And it *certainly* could not explain the shared hierarchically nested distributions of Alus among different species that perfectly match their phylogentical distances. Assuming that ERVs were the source of retroviruses insteand of the other way round, only shifts the problem to a different place.

Now, please explain observations 1-7 by other means than common descent.

Spoiler: god must have inserted the ERVs in the genomes of all kinds of species on the very same spots, with the same mutation patterns, thus making them to match perfectly the nested hierarchy observed in the phylogeny of species. And the purpose was to produce fatal and grisly diseases proving he must be an obnoxious and sickening prick.

The percentage of historians who doubt Jesus existed is much less than the percentage of biologists who doubt common descent. There's what, David Fitzgerald and Richard Carrier? And that one guy Carrier makes fun of who thinks the NT was a Roman conspiracy? There are thousands of biologists who affirm creation, even if it is a minority. I even go to church with one and I go to a small church.

You didn't refute what I said, though. I said that you had no evidence, which is true. Even if historians believed Jesus existed, they do so based on other people's beliefs, and not based on evidence.

The point remains that you can't request that I accept a claim on consensus without evidence compared to you accepting a claim on consensus with mountains of evidence. They're not equal.

There aren't thousands of biologists who affirm creation. Please, find a list of these thousands of biologists. Having a biology degree does not make one a biologist, anymore than having a theater degree makes one an actor.

&gt; You can't be an ancestor to hominids without being an ancestor to homo. If he's my father's ancestor that makes him my ancestor too.

Except if Ardi were to be an ancestor to one branch that does not include humans, because there could be something between Ardi and the LCA of humans and chimps.

Which evidence? The two papers you cited lacked these. They made claims, but ignored other evidence or simply didn't bother to investigate.

&gt; There's not ""hundreds, thousands, or millions"" of paleoanthropologists who have published or publicly commented on these issues. And among those who have I'm not even sure what the split is. Of course White says Ardi is a homo ancestor--those who discover a fossil almost always do, and it's them against the others who want their own to be. If you want to change my mind, show me what data supports the conclusion. Otherwise will you accept the resurrection of Christ because the majority of new testament historians say it happened?

You really can't argue that you have no idea why people say you lie, and then lie so much in replies. I said, ""Time and time again, I see creationists find one or two people who disagree, demand that these outliers be refuted, but ignore the dozens, hundreds, thousands, millions of biologists who agree with the original conclusion."" *Biologists* not paleoanthropologists. There are geologists, anthropologists, paleontologists, primatologists, and so forth, which can also weigh in on the evidence presented when it comes to their field of expertise.

A vast, vast majority of biologists agree with the conclusions of all the available evidence that our LCA with chimpanzees was roughly 7 million years ago. If you want to argue against that, you can't find one or two outliers who claim it's wrong; you need to show how all of the evidence does not fit, find new evidence that the conclusion cannot explain, or just admit that the conclusion fits.

And where did White ever claim that Ardi was a Homo ancestor? He claims in his 1994 paper that Ardi is a potential root species for the Hominids. It's possible that Ardi is indeed an ancestor to the Homo genus in some way, but the paper's case is regarding where Ardi fits in period, not how Ardi fits in with modern humans.

The problem with your request is that you have absolutely no evidence that Jesus existed, nor that the resurrection ever happened. This isn't where scientists are claiming that we have ancestors to humans, but that scientists have hundreds of fossil finds of earlier hominins and are working to piece together how they're related. No ones for Jesus, no contemporary works of Jesus, nothing but just a series of tales written well after the events supposedly happened.

&gt; Not really. It's just presumed to be 4-11 million years based on the number of differences between human and chimp DNA.

And here you lie again. The current timeline is 7-10 mya, with 7 being more closely correct due to a possibility of hybridization happening for 2+ million years until the populations split more cleanly. They do use genetics, but they also use these fossil finds. There's no more presumption here than just what they can determine based on the evidence that they have. If you disagree with the timeline or that we share a common ancestor at all with chimpanzees, you need to find the evidence to support your case.

455,"&gt; The very notion of physical law is a theological one in the first place

No it isn't because physical laws can be tested and have actually been tested. Unlike real theological concepts, that never have been tested and cannot be tested because they are not falsifiable. Saying that physical laws are theological is humbug of the highest order.

&gt; Modern science was conceived, and born, and flourished in the matrix of Christian theism.

No it didn't. The first scientific notions were Greek, Indian and Chinese, the next ones were Islamic and these traditions have been copied by European scholars. The first real step forward in Europa was a very important one, the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin and in England Michael Scotus, who learned Arabic in order to obtain direct access to the Arabic texts. This led to a considerable influx of scientific documents via Islam from India (mathematics, astronomy), Greece (mathematics, first principles of scientific thought, astronomy, anatomy and other topics) and what Islamic science itself added to that.

There is no doubt that *some* of the first universities emerged from cathedral and monasterial schools. But those universities were not meant for teaching science as we know it, they were to teach theology, arts, philosophy, canon law and medicine. If you were lucky, also some math but verry telling, in many ones also astrology (instead of astronomy). Soon though some of them were secularized and in some cases started to migrate to larger cities. But *most* earliest universities actually emerged *spontaneously* as scholastic guilds, independent from pope, king, prince or prelate and mostly financed by the cities. In many cases universities petitioned secular power for privileges and funding and this became a grand model. Gradually the universities which originally started from monasterian and cathedral schools became entirely independent of the church and started to teach other things than arts, theology, philosophy and medicine, especially under the influence of the translated Arabic documents. 

The best thing the church did was the so called *Parens scientiarum* of 1231, where pope Gregory IX recognized the university of Paris to be an independent ""studium generale"" (=university) and ""universitas"" (=cooperation of students and teachers).

ONLY at that time (~13th century), when universities were mostly independent of the church, and started to incorperate the knowledge retrieved from the translated Arabic documents and began to teach other disciplines that the clerical themes, Europe started to catch up with Greek and Islamic science. 

Many scientists though were canons, priests or held other functions in the church. But that doesn't matter. Most of them studied at universities that already for the most part were independent of belief and embraced the scientific notions and achievements that spoke from the translations of Arabic documents. Copernicus, who introduced heliocentrism in Europe, was a canon but his heliocentric ideas he took from those translated documents.

As soon as these ""dangerous"" ideas started to spread, problems aleady started to emerge. Bruno, a friar, ended up at the stakes and Galileo later stood trial against the Hoy Inquisition. The actual, official restoration by the church of Galileo was in ... 1998, by pope John Paul II.

Religion is founded upon belief and faith. Christian religion is based on believing the bible, by all means with respect to understanding the physical world, life and cosmos, a worthless piece of paper. As it is conceived to be the one and only word of god, it *must* be the eternal truth - because after all, god is onnipotent, omniscient and eternal standing outside of time and space. Consequently, when the observations contradict this doctrine, they *must* be wrong and off they go. 

In science it's the opposite: when observations contradict doctrine, off goes doctrine. Democracy has the same stance as science: politicians may have brilliant ideas but when after all they turn out to be not so brilliant (=observation of what really happens), we just vote down the politician and off he or she goes. Same principle. And the very opposite of the intrinsic attitude of religion. That's why science and religion are constantly fighting over the things science comes up with (heliocentrism, geologically there was no such thing as a global flood 4,500 years ago, evolution, abiogenesis, big bang...). And that's why when in societies religion previals, like in medieval Europe and Islamic countries today, theocracy rules, democracy fails and science lingers.",6,1500240065,2017-07-16 17:21:05

Before I address specifics, before I even watch the majority of the segment, I will state in advance: the reason that their claims are not accepted is that A) their methodology, from the ground up, is flawed and unscientific B) their results do not support their conclusions and C) Their entire position amounts to an argument from incredulity preserved by ignorance.  Basically, they argue ""I can't imagine this occurring without intelligent interference, so it can't""; that's fallacious right off the bat, and what makes it worse is the trend of ignoring any explanations presented that would allow a naturalistic model.

The initial few responses:

&gt;[answering why scientists don't accept their results and/or aren't perfectly rational] ""it's human to be committed to a worldview or philosophy despite contrary evidence ...""

This is ironic, given the lack of evidence supporting their positions, and is worth pointing out.

&gt;[answer continues; accuses scientists of being irrationally devoted to naturalism]

There is a serious misunderstanding here, and one that is a highlight of all the DI's work.  They are claiming that naturalism is somehow limiting to the sciences, when in actuality the naturalistic assumption of science can be phrased as follows: ""The way the universe works is consistent and testable; the rules don't change on a whim"".  This must be assumed, because otherwise we literally can't know anything; if nothing we tested gave consistent results, if nothing worked the same way twice or in predictable patterns, it'd be impossible to figure out how things worked at all.

Because of that, in the sciences, what is ""natural"" amounts to this: what has an observable, and ideally testable, effect on reality.  The ""supernatural"" therefore amounts to things that do not have an observable or testable effect on reality.  This is all that science is ""limited"" to by taking the naturalistic approach; we cannot draw conclusions about things we cannot examine, observe, or test.  In this regard, what is supernatural could be rephrased as ""that which has no describable effect on reality"" - and is utterly moot, since it has no impact on us at all.  The problem is not a devotion on the part of scientists towards there being no intelligent creator or somesuch, but rather the unmet demand for evidence that ID is still not providing - for the only way to reach the conclusions the folks at the DI do is by _reaching that conclusion first and then stretching the evidence to fit_.  There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that supports their position from base principles.  Without first assuming an intelligent creator (again, or somesuch), it is impossible to draw that conclusion from the evidence at hand.  Instead, it is something they want accepted *a priori*; phrasing this as some bias on the part of the scientists is their runaround tactic to try and project their own obvious flaw onto others.

To put it differently: science is in the process of drawing conclusions based on the evidence.  To be able to ""interpret"" the evidence in light of a creative intelligence, we would first need evidence _of that creative_ intelligence.  We do not have it.  And lacking it, we can dismiss it offhand for the same reason we can dismiss claims of invisible ""gravity faeries"" that ""intelligently make stuff fall down"": it is utterly superfluous, failing to make better predictions than the naturalistic model, and can be chucked right out through nothing more strenuous than an application of Occam's Razor.  They claim they're being treated unfairly, when the reverse is true; they've been given a fare shake, and repeatedly found wanting.  What they _want_ is to have their conclusions accepted without examination, and that's not going to happen.

Or, in short: they're disbelieved  not due to bias against them because they lack a case.  They fail to be published in peer-reviewed journals not because of bias against them, but because their work is unscientific and their conclusions are unwarranted.  They are making a claim, but they want their claim accepted as a part of the ""evidence"" supporting it.  Hah, no.

&gt;[only a fraction devoted to materialism, but they're in charge]

No, again, the big thing is simply that there is no support to the ""non-materialistic"" view.  Science is all about what we can actually test and find out; none of that has suggested anything supernatural, and naturalistic origins of the world and life stand solidly without the need for appealing to magic.

&gt;[poling data and popularity, strictly physical systems]

First, it's frankly not important.

Second, this brings up another common error they make.  The guy makes clear his distaste for the idea of being a purely material being, and in the manner he addresses it he forms an Argument from Consequences, as is typical to the DI and which is fallacious.  His reward premise can be rephrased as ""IF we are all just material, THEN we are not special/etc./etc., therefore we are not just material"" - and this is absurd.

Third, on nature documentaries and folks being more willing to accept claims of direction: of bloody course they are, because that's in line with evolution.  The entire process of selection is a directional process; what works sticks around, what doesn't work does not stick around.  It's not guided by an intelligence with a purpose (excepting where humans intentionally breed certain traits, such as in the case of dogs), but there is _direction_ to evolution; selective pressures are not random, they are very much towards whatever will allow a creature to survive and reproduce better simply because that's what would make more of themselves!",6,1500218171,2017-07-16 11:16:11

481,"&gt; Theoretical + lab evidence that random mutation is sufficient to produce the level of genetic informational change we see in organisms.

Evolution ***IS NOT*** thought or conceived to be a random process. It is random mutations X **natural selection**. The ntural selection part makes it overall a NON-RANDOM process.

And here we caught the canard. Doug Axe, Gunter Bechley, and Richard Sternberg ""calculations"" only assume evolution to be a purely random process. It isn't and consequently, their calculations are garbage, calculating God knows what but not evolutionary processes.

&gt; A fossil record that grossly accords with the picture of gradual descent from a common ancestor.

Done. Next.

&gt; Observational + historical evidence that natural selection is sufficient to effect macroevolution.

The fossil record. Because the fossil record shows THIS:

- the geological formations below our feet show many strata of earth layers, each of them unique in structure, mineral composition, morphology and fossil record.

- it implies that each had its own history and cause: if you find limestone with fish fossils buried, you know it was a former sea floor. A coal layer indicates a former forest. Sandstone with fossilized ribbles and buried dune structures tells about a former desert. And so on.

- when you start to excavate the geological column on any random spot - or nature carves it neatly out like in the Grand Canyon - you invariably see a lot of layers and entire formations piled up on top of each other. On such a random spot you see sandstone sitting on limestone with fish fossils, alternated with a thick layer of coal, then limestone again, followed by a layer of chalk etc. etc. That means that very same spot once was a desert, then a sea floor, then a forest, then a shallow sea floor again, ending up in deep sea floor. And this is quite very common and the general picture.

- the fossil record of each formation is unique in the way that they contain fossils that are found nowhere else. For instance, in the formation called Cambrian, you find life forms that are entirely alien to what we see today and, conversily, in the Cambrian layers you won't find any of the following groups of life forms: jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and land pants. As a matter of fact, during the Cambrian there was no land life at all, apart from bacterial mats. The life of the Cambrian [looked like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DPzY6o6hQ).

- whole classes of species that are living today are lacking in the older formations and there is, literally, not a single specimen to be found that breaks this rule. There are at least 5 mass extinction events and a dozen of smaller ones where the greater part of biodiversity was scattered and in each instance it started all over - in complete different directions.

In other words, there is no other sound interpretation possible for these observations: life forms changed over time. Whole new species, complete new classes, orders and even entire phyla of species emerge while they are completely lacking in the older formations. That is called macro-evolution. Life in the geological records may even designated to be macro-evolution on an epic scale.

The fossil record in itself is already decisive evidence for macro-evolution. By the time Darwin embarked on the Beagle, geology of his time already had figured this out. Darwin considered his challenge consequently not to prove common descent but to find out what mechanisms it caused.

Of course *on top of that* it is also the task of paleontologists and evolutionary biologists to provide evidence of the many transitions between life forms. This is also abundantly done. We have the decisive fossil evidence of the transition of, for instance (only a small, incomplete glossary):

- bony fish &gt; amphibian 

- amphibian &gt; reptile 

- reptile &gt; dinosaurs

- reptile &gt; mammals

- artiodactyls &gt; cetaceans

- primate &gt; humans

as well as the evolutionary pathways of many individual genera.

And, note that I did not make any assumptions about the factor time: I ONLY implied that geological formations differ greatly in biodiversity. I did not say anything about their age or about which one were to be older or younger. I do not need to assert anything about time to prove that the fossil record unambiguously and inescapably *forces* us to conclude that life changed over time during the natural history of the earth. There is no getting around it.

Macro-evolution on the run is also demonstrated by ring species. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb6Z6NVmLt8. Ring species are an example of changes crossing the species' boundaries.

Are there general principles that would allow us to predict where and when and by what mechanisms convergent evolution should occur? What role does natural history play in advancing our understanding of general evolutionary principles?

&gt; It is not a good sign that in the 21st century evolutionists are still befuddled by convergence, which is rampant in biology, and how it could occur. This certainly is a problem for the theory.

The creationist author wants us to think that these questions are an admittance of ignorance. Clearly they're asking those questions because they don't know the answers, not as a set up to answer all those questions in the rest of the paper. Oh wait...

Are there general principles that would allow us to predict where and when and by what mechanisms convergent evolution should occur?

Mutations are random. Nylonase is the result of random mutations. Given that these bacterial lineages have existed for nearly 4 billion years, it's extremely likely that those mutations occurred at some point in the past. 

However, since nylon was not around, they were not selected for, and the lineages with these mutations probably did not last very long. In other words, they were outcompeted by lineages with enzymes specialized for food sources that were actually present.

But after 1935, when those mutations occur, they can experience positive selection, since they are adaptive in the presence of nylon. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, to review. Those mutations probably occurred at some point in the past. But the extant nylon-digesting lineages are probably young (i.e. originating sometime around 1935 or shortly thereafter).

Also, note that your link talks about how those engineers are merging with biologists so they are basically partly studying the same subjects biologists learn when they are studying.

The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics; for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense.

Other than that, any recent article about the RNA world hypothesis is full of open questions. That's all there is. You're not going to find problems, but lots of open questions.

You can imagine any open question yourself. Some RNA molecules can self-replicate but have no apparent enzymatic function, some RNA molecules can bind to stuff and therefore do things like breaking down other molecules or bind molecules together (like RNA for example). The RNA world was likely a huge, global, insanely long period of time on earth right after earth had the properties to sustain such molecules. 

The amount of selection and time that it would take to build up what we call life was likely incredibly tedious and long, but the nicest thing about this is that we know it can be possible. We have a mechanism and the materials, and it all seems to work, with nothing showing us that there's anything preventing it from happening.

Also I think we can all agree that the ribosome is the key element here. It's ultra-conserved and likely the most important ribozyme in this topic. It's the connection between DNA and enzymes. The way RNA+DNA+amino acids work to bind and develop protein enzymes is fucking fascinating.

145,"&gt; Evolution may have result observation but not process observation.. does that legit?

Depends on what is evolving. Humans live up to like 115ish years, when very lucky, and a generation is on average calculated to be 20 years. So it would be hard to sit around and watch. Bacteria and viruses can have multiple generations in as little as an hour or two, much easier to watch. Also the ""result observation"" part has yielded such amazing results we base much of medicine and agriculture, two of the most important things to the survival of the entire human fucking race, on evolution working.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; And somebody did these observations.. not yourselves I suppose.. but you have faith and believe in that man tells no lies.. 😉 ergo always doubt man you don't have faith in it.

Yeah, hundreds and thousands of people have made these observations. And you become way more famous for busting lies and disproving bullshit than you do for being part of an echo chamber. Remember the names of all the people telling Newton gravity isn't a think? Nope, you would have to google it. Remember the names of the people saying Einstein was wrong? Nope, they might be written down someone but no one really cares about them. Remember the name of the guy who wrote an article about Darwin's book being wrong? Nope, no one cares what incorrect people have to say. We don't need to take anything on faith if it works, and if you don't think it works you should really look into agricultural and medical applications of evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Science facts need to be observed by real observable data to be concerned a proven theory. There are only assumptions that mutations occurred to ""prove"" evolution. 

I can't directly observe gravity, just the effect it has. Maybe if I had my own multi-billion dollar research facilities like LIGO I could, but I don't so I can't. However I have fallen off a porch and it hurt, so if I fell of a roof I could accurately predict it would hurt more because I would probably break something. That is what happens when you have a lot of data related to a process or object you can't always directly observe or interact with, you make a model by which you can make predictions. The same way the medical and agricultural fields have.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Evolution requires faith to believe in it because it cannot be proven by true scientific process.

Can we talk about this for a minute? Because this isn't a real thing. There's no such thing as a ""proven theory."" You never ""prove"" anything in science. You test an idea, and if you don't contradict it, you can conditionally accept it as valid, contingent upon the next test of that idea. 

A theory is an idea that has been tested many many times and does a good job explaining a wide range of observations. It's not proven, it's just the best explanation we have for those observations at present. 

&amp;nbsp;

To put this another way, we can look at gravity. Gravity is a law *and* a theory. Laws are descriptive and can be proven. The *law* of gravity describes the manner in which mass attracts mass. Theories are explanatory. The *theory* of gravity attempts to explain *why* mass attracts mass. 

Similarly, evolution is a fact - it happens. It is also a theory - evolutionary theory explains *how* evolutionary change happens. ""Prove"" isn't part of it. ",13,1495757626,2017-05-25 20:13:46

167,"Here is Dawkins [response to the incident](http://tccsa.tc/video/the_information_challenge.pdf).

I quote:

&gt; In September 1997, I allowed an Australian film crew into my house in Oxford without realising that their purpose was creationist propaganda. In the course of a suspiciously amateurish interview, they issued a truculent challenge to me to ""give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome."" 
&gt;
&gt; It is the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way, and it was at this point I tumbled to the fact that I had been duped into granting an interview to creationists - a thing I normally don't do, for good reasons. In my anger I refused to discuss the question further, and told them to stop the camera. However, I eventually withdrew my peremptory termination of the interview as a whole. This was solely because they pleaded with me that they had come all the way from Australia specifically in order to interview me. Even if this was a considerable exaggeration, it seemed, on reflection, ungenerous to tear up the legal release form and throw them out. I therefore relented. 
&gt;
&gt; My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered! Pathetic as it sounds, their entire journey from Australia seems to have been a quest to film an evolutionist failing to answer it.
&gt;
&gt; With hindsight - given that I had been suckered into admitting them into my house in the first place - it might have been wiser simply to answer the question. But I like to be understood whenever I open my mouth - I have a horror of blinding people with science - and this was not a question that could be answered in a soundbite. First you first have to explain the technical meaning of  ""information"". Then the relevance to evolution, too, is complicated - not really difficult but it takes time. 
&gt;
&gt; Rather than engage now in further recriminations and disputes about exactly what happened at the time of the interview (for, to be fair, I should say that the Australian producer's memory of events seems to differ from mine), I shall try to redress the matter now in constructive fashion by answering the original question, the ""Information Challenge"", at adequate length - the sort of length you can achieve in a proper article. 

The producers even never deigned to send Dawkins a copy: He completely forgot about it until an American colleague called it to his attention.  

Not telling the real purpose and aim of your interview, sneaking into someones realm without identifying yourself, distorting the import of what happened as if Dawkins was not able to answer such question and, ice topping of the cake - not even having the courtesy to send the interviewee a copy of the interview.

I couldn't live like that.

I prefer to say ""generating novel functionality"". That's a clear, simple standard: Does it do something new? If yes, novel functionality. 

I suspect creationists use ""information"" for the mirror reason: It's amorphous enough that you can dance around any specific example of a new function or new activity as not qualifying as new ""information"". For example, see the silliness around claims of ""loss of specificity"" when a protein gains a new substrate without losing the old one. Clearly a new *function*, but often framed as a loss of *information*, which is wrong for two reasons: information is never clearly defined, and new interactions often involve completely different domains of the same protein, so it's actually gaining specificity.

In the context of genetics, there isn't a consensus on how to measure ""information"". That the question was asked without a specifying a working definition tipped Dawkins off to the the fact that the interviewer presupposed a definiton that was not made explicit, and was therefore likely biased or at least ignorant of the complexities of the field. Given the context, he probably concluded that he was dealing with creationists and had fallen into a trap in the sense that any answer he gave would be distorted and misrepresented.

181,"&gt; The burden of proof is on those making a claim if they are claiming it is science. If you want to insist that a lung can evolve naturally, shouldn't you be able to at least describe mechanically plausible steps in absence of actual fossil. Oh, yeah that's the other thing, the fossils are missing.

Yes, scientific theories have a certain burden of proof. But burden of proof doesn't mean it has to produce every piece of data and evidence you demand. If you claim there's something about the lungfish that can't evolve, then you can support that argument. It would be waste of time to come up with complex evolutionary pathways, if you can't even explain what the problem is.

&gt; Here's something for starters. Suppose you have a swim bladder that is to be a proto lung and then you pump blood into it. How does the bladder not fill up with blood and not kill the poor creature. Bleeding in the lungs is bad juju, you know. You don't get that plumbing just right, it ain't good.

How exactly do you imagine blood vessels in lungs work? Do you think the blood pumps in, and kind of pools in the bottom of the lungs, before being sucked away by other blood vessels? Or do you think there's something specific about these swim bladder capillaries that would cause them to burst particularly often? I ask because the idea that these swim bladders were lined with non-bursting capillaries, like pretty much all tissue is, sounds pretty obvious.

&gt;it probably popped up in the past and maybe the primary reason its not in a population today is that it wasn't favored.

Yes. Mutations happen by chance. If selection favors them, they are more likely to persist. If not, they are more likely to be lost. Good job. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;That means the phenotype wasn't exactly new since it is the re-emergence of a phenotype that occurred in the past.

This may be the worst argument you've made yet. ""It doesn't count as evolution because it may have evolved multiple times.""

I mean, the argument is that we have a new thing that evolved. The lineage that has it didn't have it at some point in the past. Recently, more distant, whatever. Doesn't matter. It didn't have it, now it does. 

You claim this isn't *really* evolution, because that trait *may have evolved before*. So even though the specific mutations that exist now that confer this trait weren't inherited from one of those earlier times it evolved, they don't count because they had already evolved. 

Your argument is that a thing didn't really evolve because it evolved multiple times. 

Pat yourself on the back, Sal. You've made the worst anti-evolution argument I've ever heard.

Also, the *first line* of the abstract you linked:

&gt;One of the strongest signals of **adaptive molecular evolution** of proteins is the occurrence of convergent hot spot mutations

Emphasis mine. When there is a consistent selective pressure, you see the same mutations accumulate. That's called convergent evolution. It doesn't mean *only* those mutations happened.

200,"&gt; If one wishes to argue evolutionary theory is science, there should be some predictable pattern than ad hoc tautologies for why one line evolves 20,000 radically different forms while the other line doesn't evolve at all.

Is it really so absurd that, out of the millions of species on this planet, some of them haven't evolved as much as others? It doesn't sound like you need any particularly in depth explanation for that.

&gt; Many important changes require the changes to be simultaneous rather than gradual as a matter of principle. For example the teleosti fish vs. the lungfish have different blood circulatory systems, not the least of which is because the lungfish has a lung. How did the functioning lung emerge without the circulatory system to back it up? Just saying it's some sort of ballast at first doesn't make a lot of mechanical sense since a lung is more than just an air bladder.

When creationists argue something is irreducibly complex, I like to ask them exactly which parts couldn't evolve without damaging or reducing function, and how exactly they came to that conclusion. They usually find that the argument is a lot more complex than they originally thought. You might say that the lung couldn't exist without the circulatory system to back it up, but how do you know its ancestors were always so dependant on both the lung and the circulatory system being as they are? What would the actual effects be if the lung evolved, partially or otherwise, with the original circulatory system? Would it be completely useless, or just slightly worse than it is today?

I'm going to assume you don't really know what would happen during the evolution, hypothetical or otherwise, of these features. So if you don't know exactly why these features couldn't evolve, why should we have to make the effort to construct a specific pathway explaining how it could? It sounds like all you've done is found two different features, claimed that it's differences make it irreducibly complex, without any real reason, and then put the burden of refuting your lazy reasoning on us.

Also, a few point mutations of a pre-existing gene are usually regarded as ""allele"" of a gene, not a new gene.   Allele is usually for diploids, but the term is sometimes used for bacterial genes.....

Experiments by Kato 1991 showed 2 residue mutation in a mostly non-nylon eating gene nylB' caused it to become a stronger nylon eater.  I should point out the fact nylB' was weakly eating nylon when it's homologous duplicate on the same plasmid nylB ate nylon, strongly suggests nylB' had pre-existing nylon eating ability.

Also, when a gene catalyzes a new reaction, that means it likely loses the ability to catalyze a previous reaction the way it did before.

&gt;It doesn't make sense to say these enzymes always could have degraded nylon even before nylon existed. 

Sure it does.  It's fair to say most of the ability was there.  To say otherwise is like saying rocks must have evolved the ability to break car windows after car windows emerged since they couldn't break car windows before car windows emerged.   It would be ridiculous to claim rocks around the universe suddenly evolved new physical properties after car windows emerged.  Same is the case for Nylon eating ability.

If only 2 of the 392 residues are needed to be changed to induce substantial nylon eating ability in nylB', then 99.5% of the ability was already resident in the gene, it just needed a tweak.  

Luria and Delbruck statistics would suggest that with such few residue mutations that that particular ""allele"" probably popped up every now and then, but just was never preserved until nylon emerged.

The same would apply to the pseudomonas evolution if it involved a similarly small number of mutations.

I pointed out the issue of why it's total improper to call a re-emerging allele a new trait based on Luria Delbruck here:

2. Stcordova: ""Do you teach those sort of crap non-equiturs to your students?

Also note his other rethoric:

&gt; The sequence is conserved in other bacteria!

WHAT SEQUENCE? Of NylB? NOT found in other bacteria. Not in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which developed a different biochemical pathway (nylA and nylB). In any of the other bacteria that managed to evolve nylon reduction? I wonder about what sequence he's *actually* talking. Check it out because it stinks: of course the ability to process nylon is also found in other bacteria, but he was talking about *sequences*.

Than we have his [incomprehensible post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6crtxl/creationist_claim_nylonase_didnt_evolve_becauseit/dhyo8lx/) about Ohno's sequence. I've read it twice but I can't make chocolate from it. The only thing he seems to imply there is that Ohno basically is cheating. CHECK IT OUT. I DON'T BELIEVE HIM. Spelling out catg sequences all over the place does not demonstrate ANYTHING because in order to check out whether Ohno's sequence is to be found in any gene database needs 2 sequences: the one provided by Ohno and the one found in the database (otherwise you just can't compare) *OR* a clear and unequivocal statement that Ohno's sequence is not to be found in the database at all. He is only spelling out ONE sequence. It stinks.

Moreover, to bolster your arguments:

When nylon reduction ability already was present before the 1930's, there must have been substances around in nature that are chemically *identical* or at least *extremely similar* to nylon byproducts. Otherwise, the three nylonase genes must have been entirely redundant. Redundant DNA inevitably will be randomized within a few 10,000's of generations by successive mutation loads.

And his argument that other bacteria also have enzymes similar to nylonase does not count because:

- those could well have been bacteria that also have evolved such enzymes due to exposure to nylon byproducts;

- in order for his argument to be valid he *must* prove that those other bacteria were not exposed to nylon byproducts;

- and when he gets to prove this we come back to the question ""which natural substance identical or very similar to nylon byproducts are found in nature that would account for nylonase?""

If you have proof that nylonase can degrade other substances then I'd love to see it. Care to elaborate on these conserved nylonase domains? If by that you mean other enzymes that sevred other functions then you're admitting that these enzymes were then changed to adapt to digest nylon, therefore serving a new function, in order to serve a new function these genes for these enzymes would had to have changed. It doesn't make sense to say these enzymes always could have degraded nylon even before nylon existed. 

""A 1995 paper showed that scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients.

You can see that the starved sample grew much more quickly than the others, but only after many generations, why? because it was forced to use Nylon as a food source, the starvation caused it to mutate at a much quicker rate since it has more selective pressure than the other samples. If it always had these enzymes to digest nylon, it would have done so immediately, not after a few days, and its reproduction would have been consistent with the other samples that were used as controls, but it instead grew at a much higher rate, because it adapted more quickly, since it was under more pressure of selection. Again I must re-emphasize, if it could always digest nylon, it would have done so immediately instead of starving first. ",5,1495657926,2017-05-24 16:32:06

Is there a gradual transition from one to the other?  Not in the fossil record, not any suggested in extant organism, not even conceptually one in principle.   Not only is the common ancestor hypothetical, it's conceptual characteristics cannot even be conceived coherently.

Unlike gradual changes such as height, weight, and color, the lungfish circulatory system seems to be an abrupt emergence.  The requisite evolutionary changes would be saltation type steps.  At point saltations are not much different than miracles.

It's not like I'm saying stuff that other schools of evolution haven't said:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutationism

&gt;Mutationism, known before 1900 as saltationism, is the set of views of evolution that emphasizes the role of large mutations capable of causing sudden jumps including immediate speciation. It is one of several alternatives to Darwinism that have existed both before and after the publication of Charles Darwin's 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, which was gradualist.[1] Mutation is seen as the source of novelty; if natural selection is considered, it is not seen as creative, and the direction of evolution is understood to reflect both mutation and selection.[2]

&gt;Saltationism was the common view before Darwin; in 1822 Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire argued that species could be formed by sudden transformations. Darwin opposed saltation, insisting on gradualism in evolution as in geology. In 1864, Albert von Kölliker revived Geoffroy's theory. In 1901 the geneticist Hugo de Vries gave the name ""mutation"" to seemingly new forms that suddenly arose in his experiments on the evening primrose Oenothera lamarckiana, and by 1909, mutationism became a rival to Darwinism supported by early geneticists including William Bateson, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and Reginald Punnett.

213,"&gt; We should expect the descendant of a fish to be more like a fish.

If I may, the generic definition of ""fish"" *purposefully excludes all tetrapods*, because you cannot get a single clade of ""fish"" without including tetrapods.

If you *had* been a believer in evolutionary theory, why would you have a hard time believing that tetrapods came from fish? Ultimately, tetrapods *are* members of the same group as fish and therefore **fish descendants have always been fish**.

&gt;Now why did it's supposed cousin evolve into 20 000 or more extant tetrapods including kangaroos and cows and tigers and birds and turtles? Evolution supposedly explains the persistence of the Colelecanth and then simultaneously the diversity of it's supposed cousins.

Do cousins always share the exact same destiny? Are individuals of *any* closeness unable to be different from one another? Even twins can go a different path, correct?

&gt; None of the important changes make much mechanical sense without invoking miracles...

Could you explain why this is? As an example, why would a population of fish that want to move better in shallow waters **need** a miracle to change? Why would that changed population **need** a miracle to do better in even shallow water and then it's descendants do better on land? Do you not see even a *theoretical* answer as to how a fish population *might* move toward a change over time?

&gt;...but if one must invoke miracles to preserve common ancestry, one may as well be a creationist.

On the one hand, I agree that you *could* make that leap. On the other hand, invoking miracles to promote a second idea (ie: Miracle-infused Evolution) does not necessarily mean that the first idea (Evolutionary theory) and second idea are automatically equal to a third idea (Young Earth Creationism).

220,"&gt; What I mean is that we could spare a lot of time by concentrating on the real issue people see, which is the explanatory scope of the mechanism.

Most people do not see such an issue. There are many people that have problems with evolution solely because it's contradicting the literal reading of their holy book. Or they just don't like the idea that ""humans are just apes"" (whatever tis means). They have no idea about the ""explanatory scopes of mechanisms"". I agree that the explanatory scope of hypothetized mechanisms indeed is at the core of the scientific course but it is not much of an issue for people. It is your issue, by all means justified, but still yours.

&gt; Also, macroevolution and microevolution don't describe different mechanisms. So the problem is not with macroevolution, as most people falsely claim...

That excludes all creationists here. They all think that macroevolution is impossible and that microevolution and macroevolution are two totally different things.

&gt; ""A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism""

Yes I very well know of it. It's the very next example of creationist's deceit and distortion.

First, watch [this YouTube post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty1Bo6GmPqM) by Don Exodus. Summary:

- only a tiny part of the scientists on the list were actually biologists.

In 2008, when Don Exodus did his inquiry, the list counted 101 names. No more than 39 were biologists.

Now, if you fall ill, what would you do: call an evolutionary biologist or call a doctor? A doctor of course. Well then: if you want to hear about the state of affairs of evolution theory, who do you call, an evolutionary biologist or a doctor? An evolutionary biologist evidently. You don't ask mathematicians, engineers, cosmologists or psychologists (all on the DI list) when you want to know how strong the scientific support for a certain theory is. You ask the relevant experts.

- Don Exodus bothered to contact all relevant experts on the list, those 39 biologists. The result was telling. Four of them could not be traced back. Out of those 16 who did respond (the non-response was 19), 14 declared that they accept evolution. Only two biologists told they actually do not support the idea of common descent. Those two were David A. DeWitt, who holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience and Clarence Fouche, professor of biology. Weird enough, Fouche didn't know what ERV's are and other red flags telling that he didn't know much about evolution theory. Which for a biology professor is nothing less but an astonishing anomaly.

- now why would 14 persons say they agree with evolution theory while they are on a list of people who supposedly are 'dissenting' from Darwinism. For that, take a closer look at the statement itself they endorsed: ""*We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutations and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged*"".

Behold how cunning and slick the statement is fabricated. OF COURSE any scientifically educated biologist would, I would say SHOULD agree that careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory must be encouraged. Because that's what science is all about. And being skeptical of ANY claim is also basic to a proper scientific attitude.

- consequently, some of the people Don Exodus contacted were just straight pissed off for being included on the list when they found out that they were lured into advocating creationism. Some of them requested the DI to remove them, which OF COURSE was not conceded or acknowledged.

In other words: the word ""dissent"" is misplaced. It pretends to show how much opposition there is among scientists against Neo-Darwinism. It is *manufactured* dissent. Currently- creationists NEVER correct their deceit but just continue (many like Don Exodus have pointed out to the flaws and deceit) - the lists counts some 1500 signatories. If the rate Don Exodus calculated still are repesentive for the current list, there are only 30 biologists who really dissent from Darwinism. There are some 3.5 million biologists today worldwide. 

How impressive.

I fyou'd ask me what I think of the statement? Well: SURELY careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged. TOTALLY agree.

Of course it is.

Sal has impaired reasoning capacities so he thinks that finding nylonase variants in other bacteria makes his case. It doen't.

Because emission of nylon byproducts is happening all over the world and bacteria living in affluent waste water from plastic plants INEVITABLY will also evolve nylonase variants. And here's the evidence:

1. in his long term experiment on E. coli Lensky found several different strains evolving the capability to metabolize citric acid. Those strains were meticulously held isolated from each other. When exposed to different 'diets', bacteria *will* evolve to accommodate such new diets at the end.

2. in [their 1995 experiment](http://aem.asm.org/content/61/5/2020.long), Prejijambada, Negoro, Yomo and Urabe demonstrated that a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria also evolved nylonase. As expected, these bacteria took a whole other biochemical course to accomplish it than the Flavobacteria did.

What I mean is that we could spare a lot of time by concentrating on the real issue people see, which is the explanatory scope of the mechanism. Being skeptical of macroevolution doesn't make any sense if we accept that small changes can accumulate over time with only practical limits (humans will only ever grow significantly taller (like a giraffe), if we start increasing ceiling heights everywhere). Also, macroevolution and microevolution don't describe different mechanisms. So the problem is not with macroevolution, as most people falsely claim. There is a statement I am sure you are aware of called ""A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism"". This is the way they put it:

&gt;""We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutations and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.""

That's also what *does* happen when we find new fossils, because even though we have a sequence built up already for most things (ie forms of life), and new fossil adds a new data point that we have to examine to see how that fits into our existing sequence. Sometimes that's very easy (it may just be a species we already know about that was found at a time period where we've already found that same species, so this fossil just adds to an existing part of the sequence) or it may require more analysis (if the fossil is a different variant of a known species, and/or was found from a time period or geographic region where those types of organisms were previously unknown, etc.).

232,"&gt; I don't know how to address it, but both sides are guilty of heating up the debate.

That was not what I asked. Heating up the debate is no problem for me, also when creationists do it. Some emotions, getting angry, it's all human. But you wrote that each opinion should have its own words. And I answered that's correct but lying and deceit should not have their own words. And I took just one random website, uncommondescent.com - I might well had taken any other one - or just a random post by any of the creationsits here - or any random other statement on uncommondescent.com - and showed it was littered with straw men, straight lies and misinterpretations. Should that have its own words?

When I debate I expect my opponents to represent the ideas I endorse correctly as they may expect me to do the same. Then we may have a (fierce) discussion about their merits. But debating creationists is mostly addressing misinterpretations, straw men and straigh deceit. And mostly I am busy with ondoing and stripping off the straw men and distortions instead of having a real discussion. I think that will count for about 75% (rough estimate) of all creationists posts here. And, really, I do not exaggerate. I wish we would ACTUALLY have a debate about evolution instead of addressing straw men. I would rather prefer to be called an asshole in the heat of debate than being confronted with distortions and straw men al lthe time.

I asked you what to do with people that overtly lie, deceive and distort in the light of the norm that every opinion should have its own words.

&gt; Observing change, and building fossil sequences aren't the same. 

Unless the observed evidence leads us to a fossil sequence. We DO SEE a gradual loss of toes in the fossil sequence of equidae, starting with three toes, each having a hoof, gradually ending up in the splint bones of extant horses. You can't get around it, it's there. And you have to explain it, because that's the reason we do science - to explain phenomena.

&gt; First we observed change, then created a theory, and then started to build fossil sequences (like the horse sequence) that must fit the theory.

No:

1. first we observed that life changes throughout the geological stratification.

2. then Darwin was puzzled about it and asked himself: what could have caused this, what mechanisms are there that would account for this observed change?

3. then he took off on the Beagle for a nearly 6 years long expedition, criss-crossing all continents, trying to make sense out of what he observed.

4. this led to his notion of natural selection acting upon heredity (he was not able to get a grasp on the latter because he lacked the whole of modern genetics).

5. but just like any other scientific notion, it must be tested. In other words, we should find fossils that show a clear sequence in traits from former, extinct species to extant ones.

Observations of the fossil record are also used to TEST hypotheses. For instance, as I explained in my last post, Darwin also thought that evolutionary change must be gradual and slow. But *that* has been falsified by paleontological observations. It did not stand up against the scrutiny of empirical testing. Often we see disruptive change (disruptive in geological timeframe that is).

But *when* biologists and paleontologists are about to test the hypothesis of natural selection, then all of a sudden they are accused of ""creating fossil sequences by preproposed concepts"".

So the proper methodological sequence is: (a) first we observe change &gt; (b) establish a hypothesis how to explain the change &gt; (c) test the hypothesis by observing &gt; (d) reject the hypothesis or accept it or adjust it according to the observations &gt; (a1) restart for further advancement. And step (b) might be done using 2 different approaches:

a. theoretisize about it, using pure brainpower and figure out if you can come up with something sensible. An example of this is how Newton conceived his laws of gravity and motion. He tried to grasp it with reasoning and mathematical constructs. But there still was a little observation here: the anecdote tells he sat under a tree and saw an apple dropping. That observation reset everything in his mind in the orderly way he needed to establish his mathematical constructs.

b. go back to nature and start to observe and try to make sense out of what she has to tell about possible mechanisms that could explain the phenomena you're after. That was the course Darwin followed.

Anyway, after having formulated a hypothesis, is still has to be tested. Hypotheses are predictions about what we ought to observe in order for them to be correct.

Newtons concepts turned out to be only partly true. For instance, the planet Mercury does not behave the way the laws of gravitation predicts. So, basically, Newton's idea has been falsified. But not entirely. There are configurations of constellations where Newton's laws are still pretty much useable.

Darwin's hypothesis about the mechanism of natural selection acounting for biodiversity, has been tested abundantly, using observations on the horse evolution for instance, and stood up against the test of time greatly (except for the pace of evolution Darwin predicted). As a maater of fact, evolution is the most intensively tested scientific hypothesis EVER. There is not a single other theory everywhere to be found in any science discipline that is so well empirically established than evolution. Not in astronomy, not in physics, not in chemistry, cosmology, you name it. Literally.

As it seems, you are, maybe without realizing yourself, not only talking about the merits of methodology of biology but as a matter of fact about the scientific methodology as such.

&gt; I will think about the things you have written, do some reading, and I probably come back to it later.

233,"I used to be an evolutionist and what changed my mind was realizing what silly arguments they have backed up by circular reasoning and equivocation.

I realized what a dumb idea it is to expect the descendants of a fish (sarcopterygii) to be birds and elephants.  We should expect the descendant of a fish to be more like a fish.  Look at the living fossil coelacanth.  It was that way for hundreds of millions of years according to paleontologists.  Now why did it's supposed cousin evolve into 20 000 or more extant tetrapods including kangaroos and cows and tigers and birds and turtles?  Evolution supposedly explains the persistence of the Colelecanth and then simultaneously the diversity of it's supposed cousins.   None of the important changes make much mechanical sense without invoking miracles, but if one must invoke miracles to preserve common ancestry, one may as well be a creationist.

Nobody even wants to touch legitimate evolutionary transitions such as the one implicated here:
https://liarsfordarwin.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/differing-prokaryotic-vs-eukaryotic-protein-synthesis-initiation/

I could put together thousands of such problems because so many transitions entail such biochemical changes of architecture.  Do evolutionary biologists deal with them no.  They pretend the problem was solved by appeal to their circularly reasoned phylogenetic fantasies.

I have no proof such an ancestor existed, but well it just looks so cool if it did, because if it existed, and then the Thymine got inserted into my hypothetical sequence, it looks just like the real sequences we have today.

No it doesn't.  The gene may have been essentially unchanged since 1935.

The fact that there are quite a number of nylonase homologs in bacteria suggests the domains are more ancient than 1935.  Oh wait, you're an evolutionary biologist, you should be slobbering over all the conserved nylonase features floating around in other bacteria rather than trying to promote the nylonase features as something brand new.

If an enzyme does a few things, and evolves to do a new thing, that's a loss of function (lost the old function[s]). If an enzyme evolves a new thing *without* losing the old function, that's a loss of *specificity*, which is never clearly defined. This framing paints *any* change from the status quo as a ""loss"" or ""degradation,"" the point being that evolutionary processes can only destroy, rather than create. 

Of course, this ignores the reality that in many cases of novel functionality, both functions involve specific interactions, and the participating proteins are often *more* constrained than they previously were. But don't let pesky facts ruin a good talking point, amirite?

Also, you do this thing where you explain some kind of evolutionary process or dynamic as though nobody's ever heard it before, even though its basic evolutionary theory. You should maybe take the time to learn the basics. ",8,1495595275,2017-05-23 23:07:55

&gt;NylB is only one enzyme, not multiple enzymes.

Do you do even the most basic of research about the subject you're going to argue about before posting? The biochemical pathway to convert nylon to energy is a multiple step process, with more than one gene/enzyme.

&gt;If you modify and enzyme to catalyze a new reaction or a reaction in a different way, you usually LOSE specificity

You've been asked what that other function is perhaps half a dozen times in this thread and have simply ignored the question. 

Plus as a friendly hint. Specificy means a narrowing of the range of interactions an enzyme can perform. The root word is specific. You have the meaning of the word backwards.

It challenges your silly citation about nylonase NylB being unique to only on strain of flavobacteria, it's not because KI72 was mis classified as flavobacteria, not to mention NylB also appears in agromyces, which that dimwit Thawaites wasn't aware of in 1985 since it's discovery in agromyces was in 2006 as well as the reclassification of KI72 from flavobacteria to arthro bacteria.

Do you teach those sort of crap non-equiturs to your students?  

NylB is only one enzyme, not multiple enzymes.   

A pre existing enzyme being modified by 2 residues is hardly a large evolutionary leap. 

But let me splain something to you.  If you modify and enzyme to catalyze a new reaction or a reaction in a different way, you usually LOSE specificity toward other reactions.  Did you ever think of that in your accounting?  You gain one function by losing a pre-existing one, whereas the grand claim of evolution is something simple evolving to something complex.

It was no pre-conceived idea, it was something that gradually emerged from the many observations he made.

Observing change, and building fossil sequences aren't the same. First we observed change, then created a theory, and then started to build fossil sequences (like the horse sequence) that must fit the theory.

249,"&gt; Seriously, if you have a question, that is relevant to my comment, I will answer it.

Yes please, you took the right parts from my post. I dearly want to know. And it's relevant to your first response to my head post. But, mind keep the ones you took in their context. Otherwise, i will remind you of the real import of what I asked.

&gt; Thanks for the clarification. But how is the method a reliable basis for any conclusion, if the scientific method relies on the conclusion.

It doesn't. We do not build sequences that fit the theory, we test theories by looking at the sequences OBSERVED and we formulate theories that fit the observed sequences best.

Examples.

1. when Darwin embarked on the Beagle for his long trip (a few years) he had NO IDEA what to think. The only thing he knew was that in geology during the previous decades the conclusion was drawn that life has changed during the course of history of the earth - see what I wrote about that in my head post. When he took off, Darwin really had no idea how such observed change in life could have happened. Only after years of all kinds of observations he found an answer: natural selection. It was no pre-conceived idea, it was something that gradually emerged from the many observations he made.

2. later research and observations learned that this idea basically was correct. Because others will test the idea (natural selection) in *their* observations. But the idea of natural selection has stood the test of time greatly.

3. Darwin thought though that all the evolutionary change by means of natural selection must be slow and gradual. But especially in the 1940's and later, paleontologists started to realize from their many observations of the fossil record that evolution often rather happens to be abrupt and with a fast pace, alternated with periods of relative stasis. So biology needed a better theory that meets the new observations better. So, still evolution by means of natural selection but in a kind of start en stop fashion. In the 1970's Eldredge and Gould came up with this new concept, punctuated equilibrium.

No pre-conceived presupposition but a *theory* that is *adjusted* when the observations demand it.

&gt; I did not say, that it is a scientific method. I have asked, if there is a scientific method of creating fossil ""sequences"" that don't rely on the presupposition that darwinism is true. 

And AGAIN I say that Darwinism is not a method - it *uses* the scientific method. Hence, there is no such thing as a scientific method that relies on Darwinist presuppositions. the scientific method is all about empirical observation. There's no such ting as ""Darwinist empircal observation"".

&gt; Having no scientific theory should be favored over enthusiastic interpretations of the evidence.

Agree but the very AIM of science is to EXPLAIN. Endlessly observing until the end of time is nonsensical.

From the mist of numerous observations, often a picture itself appears. Science is about letting the observations lead and prevail. But observations WILL lead you to somewhere by their own admission. The observations really have smething to tell. Of course people, scientists, can be biased. They might see things that are simply not there. But inevitably, the scientific method has a powerful mechanism to control that: testing. And you can do it yourself. But others will do it for you.

Thanks for the clarification. But how is the method a reliable basis for any conclusion, if the scientific method relies on the conclusion. We are looking for specific traits that are relevant to build a sequence that fits the theory, which at the end does not prove anything.

252,"Ah Sal.

Sal's is twiddle the fiddle the niggle nitpicking in GREAT detail and rooting through his gene mud, juggling with DNA letters in order to tapdance around the inevitable:

1. before the 1920's there were no nylon byproducts or compounds around. Because nylon is an entirely synthetic material, and nowhere to be found in nature.

2. after the 1920's nylon and its synthetic byproducts were emptied into the surface water. 

3. the bacteria living there became increasingly exposed to the new stuff. And after a while they managed to digest it.

4. in order to digest nutrients you need enzymes to reduce them into components that are suited to be processed biochemically according to the specific metabolistic requirements of that particular organism.

5. when you have new compounds that weren't there before - that were even entirely absent within all nature - you also need *brand new* enzymes. You know, enzymes that weren't there before either. Just in case because Sal doesn't seem to understand what ""new"" means in English.

6. and in order to produce brand new enzymes you need brand new genes. You know, genes that weren't there before with the same DNA sequence. For ""new"", see 5 above.

7. now, the type of genes we are talking here about is a particular and unique sequence of DNA coding for an enzyme. When you have a new enzyme, you need another DNA sequence. A new sequence. For ""new"", see 5 above.

8. there are several ways for a new DNA sequence to emerge: (a) a single point-mutation, (b) a sequence of 2 or more point-mutations (*over time*, not or very rarely simultaneously - just telling - most creationsist don't even understand that), (c) a whole chunk of DNA copied in one mutation instance, (d) a whole gene copied in one single mutation instance - and from there, over next generations, subsequently altered by (a), (b) or (c). And often all those accompanied by frame shifting.

9. anyway, it doesn't matter HOW, a *brand new gene* has emerged, otherwise there wouldn't had been *brand new enzymes* emerged.

But Sal wants to twist and turn and root and twiddle the fiddle the niggle nitpick as much as he can to turn ""never observed enzymes"" and ""never observed DNA sequences"" into something that ""somehow"" already must have existed before although everyone knows it could not have existed before and it actually didn't exist before.

Word weaselry, lots of incomprehensible details muddled and twisted and turned ending up [looking like this](https://youtu.be/Cyk7utV_D2I?t=1m7s). In the world of Sal it takes everything to save the obsolete Bronze Age myths to persist, even by conflating""new"" and ""not new"" into a whole new level of the English language.",8,1495575256,2017-05-23 17:34:16

Soon they're going to say, ""But AGCT exists already!""",3,1495573056,2017-05-23 16:57:36
255,"First of all, there's no point to making sequences if something like evolution didn't happen. 

Second, these sequences are not made arbitrarily, but rather they are put into place because of *data* and *observations* that directly guide the pattern that defines the sequence. Chronological and geological data, for example, guides the sequence. You can't just make arbitrary sequences because they are not supported by the data. That's why you can't put a big modern horse at the front of the evolutionary chain, because no large modern horse fossils exist at the beginning of that chain. You'll never find a big horse fossil from 100 million years ago, for example. 

Third, the fossil evidence of morphological changes that occur over time does not exist independently in a vacuum. We can *corroborate* and verify those sequences with other *independent* forms of data, which help us verify the accuracy of those sequences (and we will modify those sequences accordingly when needed). This includes modern morphological traits (eg the presence of proto-limbs in snakes and whales, which should never occur if evolution didn't happen, the presence of tooth genes in bird beaks which again should never exist if evolution didn't happen, etc), it includes geographic correlations (fossils found on continents that have split but were previously joined, the spread of species over geographic regions over time, etc.), and also includes genetic analysis where we can directly see how organisms are related to each other, and we can track those changes in great detail. And (big surprise) all that data corroborates and directly supports the sequences we have derived for evolutionary progressions.

The sequences cannot be arbitrary because *they have to be backed up by data*, and have to form a pattern backed up by all forms of available evidence. This isn't some kind of thought-experiment. 

We have to demonstrate patterns of progression and change that occur through time and geography, along with corresponding hereditary relatedness. And we've done that *extensively*. It's 2017 and our science is extremely robust.

256,"&gt; Without the presupposition that darwinism is true, would we come to the same sequence (general increase in size) of horse fossils as presented to prove darwinism? 

The gradual evolutionary change from the early Eocene perissodactyl species Hyracotherium to modern Equus involves a bunch of *coherent* anatomical traits. Please restate your question because it is entirely inadequate. We don't draw paleontological conclusions by just following one trait (body size) through geological time.

&gt; It seems to me, that we could build a large number of similar sequences, centering around change in general size (or other arbitrary feature) ...

Paleontology is about ALL COMBINED and RELEVANT traits observed through geological time linking the OBSERVED traits in an extant species back in time to the traits of past species.

Hence:

- NO ""arbitrary"" traits but traits that are TYPICAL for species, in this case, Equidae

- NO just a large number of similar sequences all traced back one by one but the *combined* phenotype of traits, typical of a species examined INTEGRALLY

- NO ""similar"" sequences, ""centering around general size"" but ALL KINDS of different sequences: teeth, hoofs, legs, face, toes and, of course, also overall body size.

&gt; Is there a scientific method of creating fossil ""sequences"" that don't rely on the presupposition that darwinism is true?

... is a completely erratic question. Darwinism is't a scientific method, it *uses* the scientific method. Darwinism is an *explanatory model* that fits the observed facts best. An explanatory model that explains the observed facts best is called a ""scientific theory"".

So, is you don't mind, I will restate your question in the proper fashion:

&gt; Is there a scientific theory other than Darwinism that explains the observed fossil ""sequences"" best?

The asnwer is NO. Unless you know another scientific theory that explains the observed facts in the fossil record better.

Without the presupposition that darwinism is true, would we come to the same sequence (general increase in size) of horse fossils as presented to prove darwinism? 

It seems to me, that we could build a large number of similar sequences, centering around change in general size (or other arbitrary feature), by using the same scientific methods and criteria of building sequences, that would apparently disprove darwinism.

264,"&gt;Nylonase didn't evolve because...it evolved?

Nylonase didn't evolve (as in change over time) via frame shift mutation post 1935 as Ohno claimed.  Most likely it was point mutation if there was any evolution at all.  Unless we have pre-1935 samples of KI72 (the bacteria in question) we can't unequivocally assert KI72 even changed in the way claimed!  Further, if there was post 1935 evolution toward nylonase, the changes likely were through simple point mutations post 1935 of existing genes versus post 1935 frame shift mutations (as Ohno argued).  2-residue changes could easily be sufficient based on Kato's 1991 work.  For all we know, there was no change.

Even if nylonase did evolve post 1935, that has nothing to say as far evolution (as in descent with modification from a universal common ancestor).

I gave credible reasons to reject Ohno's 1984 PNAS paper starting with the fact his supposed PR.C sequence only exists in his imagination, not in any real bacteria!

Further, there are 4 homologous genes  nylB and nylB' in KI72 and A-nylB and A-nylB' in KYR5 of exactly 1179 bases long.  How is it that all 4 genes have the critical thymine inserted post 1935 simultaneously?

312,"&gt; Most people are skeptical about the explanatory scope of the mechanism (natural selection and mutation).

Biologists and geneticists don't.

Generally: the better educated and knowledgeable people are, the more they endorse evolution.

This might be an ad hom ar first sight, but:

&gt; so people couldn't pretend they are ignorant about the real problem most people see.

Most people? Who exactly? Let's dive a bit into this:

- in Europe, most people accept evolution with some exceptions.

- in Christianity, worldwide most people accept evolution. The Vatican and English Anglecan church accept evolution.

- even in the USA a slight majority of people support evolution, although when you mention ""human evolution"" this rate drops. Only a minority of Americans though completely deny evolution.

So, what *most* people are you referring to? Maybe it counts in the very small part of the world called ""USA"" but the USA is rather an exception compared with the rest of the developed world. USA resembles Islam on this point with the same rate of religious fundamentalistic, bronze age world views and, therefore, opposition against evolution.

&gt; This should have its own word...

Obviously it should have its own word. Happily we live in a free culture where everyone has the right to expresss his or her opinion and advocate it.

But so do the exponents of flat earth or the ones who still think that the earth does not move and stands in the centre of the universe. Or the ones who think that our world is 6,000 years old. And 4,500 years ago it was flooded over the top of all mountains.

At the end it all comes to the credibility of an idea and the extent to which it is supported by observational evidence.

Frankly, I am not very impressed by the reasons all those people provide for their skepsis about the explanatory power of the mechanisms genetic mutation and natural selection. As a matter of fact, sometimes I stare at the very next comment by those skeptics and just am wondering how some people manage to produce such crap, deceit, twisting and turning, ignorance and for the rest utter stupidity. 

I am not only unimpressed but also think that such degree of ignorance and stupidity is just no good sign of the current state of the USA.

Mostly those comments do not even address evolution but some straw man they made from it which they are beating up all the time.

The above evidence for evolution from the fossil record isn't even accepted by them. For instance, read  uncommondescent.com, one of their websites, I quote:

&gt; Any evidence contradicting the primitive religion of Darwinism — including, for example, the entire fossil record — they explain away with non-scientific excuses like “the dog ate our fossils.”

&gt; Jan Bergstrom, a paleontologist who examined the Chinese fossils, said the Cambrian Period was not “evolution,” it was “a revolution.” So the Darwiniacs pretended they missed the newspaper that day.

&gt; Intelligent design scientists look at the evidence and develop their theories; Darwinists start with a theory and then rearrange the evidence.

&gt; These aren’t scientists. They are religious fanatics for whom evolution must be true so that they can explain to themselves why they are here, without God. (It’s an accident!)

&gt; Any evidence contradicting the primitive religion of Darwinism — including, for example, the entire fossil record — they explain away with non-scientific excuses like “the dog ate our fossils.”

This was all about the fossil record.

And let's take just ONE piece of this POOP to show how terrible it STINKS:

&gt; &gt; Jan Bergstrom, a paleontologist who examined the Chinese fossils, said the Cambrian Period was not “evolution,” it was “a revolution.” So the Darwiniacs pretended they missed the newspaper that day.

In the *first place* the Cambrian explosion was ALREADY extensively addressed **by Darwin himself**. Chapter X of the *Origins of Species* and also in later letters to fellow scientists.

Next, later, the (Neo-)**DARWINISTS** Niles Eldredge and Stephen Gould came up with their theory of punctuated equilibrium, saying that instances like the Cambrian explosion can be explained by the fact that sometimes the evolutionary process can be accelerated due to radical changes in the environmental conditions, for instance after large extinction instances when new niches are opened for species surviving the demise to exploit. They were talking about the *pace* of evolution. Not only slow, gradual change as Darwin suggested but also instances of rapid evolutionary change. And with ""rapid"" they meant geologically spoken 'rapid'. The Cambrian ""explosion"" lasted *no less than* 20 million years.

(Neo-)**DARWINIST** Jan Bergström was one of the paleontologists who excavated the Maotianshan shale beds of Chengjiang, one of the major finding places for Cambrian fossils. He was an advocate of the punctuated equilibrium theory.

Hence, it COMPLETELY escapes me how THE HELL one could write that Darwinists must have ""missed the newspaper"" as it were the DARWINIST *themselves*, STARTING WITH Darwin himself who knew of the (geological spoken) ""sudden"" appearance and radiation of life forms in the Cambrian, who did all the field work and who brought in alternative ideas how to explain it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IN THE BLOODY F#CKING FIRST PLACE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;.

Could you please explain to us how we should address this TERRIBLE CRAP and STINKING SHIT?

Is this the ""real problems"" you were talking about ""most people see"" and which should have ""its own word""?
BTW I DON'T THINK that lying, deceit and misinterpretations should have ""its own word"", DON'T YOU THINK? If you agree, then realize that about the vast majority of the posts here on Reddits made by creationists should be immediately flushed through the toilet. I DO NOT exaggerate.

318,"On the video...

She claims molecular clocks are based on...

&gt;Assuming fossil record is accurate, radiometric dating is accurate, and humans diverged from chimps. 

Humans did not diverge from chimps. Humans and chimps diverged from a common ancestor. Radiometric dating *is* accurate. We don't have to assume the fossil record is ""accurate,"" we just have to take it at face value. In other words, fossils are actually the age they seem to be, formed the way we know fossils form, etc. There's nothing inherently ""right"" or ""accurate"" about the fossil record. It just is, and we can use it to draw conclusions. 

That's the first thing she's said on the issue, and immediately she's completely wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next sentence...

&gt;Mitochondrial eve is ""assumed to have lived 100,000-200,000 years ago.

No. We've concluded based on several lines of evidence that mtEve lived about then. We're not assuming anything. 

This is not an argument for a recent mtEve. It's a sloppy attempt to discredit the conclusion that such an individual existed &gt;100kya. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now she's talking about mutations rates instead of substitution rates. Says ""woah fast mutation rate but not that many differences!"" This is dishonest. That's simply the difference between mutations that occur and those that are passed on. 

&amp;nbsp;

...and then she says that creationists shouldn't be using molecular clocks to support a recent mtEve. And this is where she kind of gives up the game. She knows these measures are highly dependent on what part of the genome you use, and she knows the difference between substitutions and mutations. So she's happy to give the quick, dishonest version that generates the desirable answer, but then warns everyone ""but hey let's not get too into this stuff, okay?""

This is an attempt to have one's cake and eat it, too. If you think the technique is valid and the conclusions worth sharing, you have an obligation to do it right, which gives you an undesirable answer. If you think the technique isn't informative because it's overly sensitive to different variables, then don't present it at all. 

What Dr. Purdom does is present a dishonest version of how this technique works (and I say dishonest rather than sloppy or incorrect because she knows better), and then say ""but we shouldn't rely on such methods *too* much."" What she knows is if you do it right you get an undesirable answer, but what the audience hears is ""if you hear about this elsewhere and it shows something else, you can disregard it.""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;There's no consensus...

There is a consensus *range*, and they all agree it's &gt;60kya, i.e. earlier than the migration out of Africa.

&amp;nbsp;

Back to assumptions with molecular clocks, literally just repeating arguments from before.

&amp;nbsp;

Claims dating is circular. It isn't. Radiometric dating is absolute, not relative.

Here's the actual quote:

&gt;Despite their allure, we must sadly conclude that all divergence estimates discussed here [1–13] are without merit. Our advice to the reader is: whenever you see a time estimate in the evolutionary literature, demand uncertainty!

See the difference? It's subtle: the references after ""discussed here"". This paper is a critique of a number of specific studies, on the grounds that their methodology was improper, and therefore returned convergence date ranges that are too precise. The authors very much do not claim that all such studies or techniques are invalid. They are simply pushing for their peers to do a better job. Here's a line from the abstract that gets at the heart of the issue:

&gt;The illusion of precision was achieved mainly through the conversion of statistical estimates (which by definition possess standard errors, ranges and confidence intervals) into errorless numbers.

She wraps up this section with a series of baffling claims: that we assume all organisms mutate at the same rate, that we assume all regions of DNA mutate at the same rate. 

Nobody assumes these things. They are not true. I have no idea why she thinks anyone thinks these things. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then she pivots to how man didn't observe any of this, but God is infallible blah blah blah. And we know that biblical Eve lived a few thousand years ago blah blah blah. Why can we say this? ""Biblical chronology.""

And then aside from the mutation/substitution conflation, she doesn't even try to make a science based argument for a recent Eve. Just ""science is wrong, God is right, therefore Eve.""

That's evolution, and it is a fact.  It happens.  Ever had the flu more than once?  You've been a victim of an evolving virus.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria?

I know that's a common theist argument, but even the most basic thought into it shows that it's wrong. All but the most extreme narcissists would believe that they are a god, just because they don't believe one exists. We all know that we're mortal, with normal mortal limitations.

You would also have to be pretty stupid to believe that simply not believing in a creator would mean that you're not going to be accountable to said creator. It would be like a criminal deciding that they could get away with murder by denying that the judge exists.

Even then, you basically admit that you believe that because you want to believe it. It's not like your experience and relationship with God is tangible, like your phone is. You can't speak to God and hear words back, like in any real relationship.

I don't see how this follows. Evolution doesn't have to step on God's toes at all unless you take a very literal reading of the bible. The entire Roman Catholic Church accepts that evolution occurs, and are content with God having the role of the designer of the process.

When I ""design"" intelligent software or solutions to complex problems, I don't directly create the final product. Instead, I set up a system and let it change through time according to a process that I choose, and if I did my job well the system will iterate through increasingly better solutions until it finds a much better solution than I could ever come up with directly. Some of these processes look *very* similar to evolution.

347,"&gt;Jesus sounds better than evolution. It's up to you to prove otherwise.

Thank you for the answer in front of what can be, at times, a hostile crowd. However, I think you're wrong on this account and let me explain why.

For starters this isn't an arguement between creation and evolution. If in some world you could prove the theory of evolution false that doesn't mean the God created the world. Evidence against evolution **isn't evidence for creation** nor is it evidence for the silly atomic lobster theory I was pushing a few weeks ago to highlight this aberration.

Believing in a creation isn't a perquisite for believing in God. There are plenty of theists who accept God and also accept the fact of evolution. 

If your argument hinges on what is observed I'll point out we've never observed a deity, nor have we ever observed a creation event. Evolution has been observed.",6,1495429904,2017-05-22 01:11:44
348,"&gt;Firstly, it isn't fair to say that evolutionists also believe what we want to believe. The main reason is that there isn't really anything to gain by believing in evolution. Even for those of us that believe in an afterlife, we don't believe they're going to be rewarded for believing in evolution. It doesn't give us any particular comfort in this lifetime either.

There is though. When you believe in evolution you don't have to do what God says. You in a sense are god. You don't have to address your wrong standing with the creator. I mean not to say YOU specifically but most people. They want to live how they want not how God wants them to.

&gt;Finally, a question: If you believe that facts, and evidence don't matter, only what you want to believe matters, doesn't that feel unsatisfying? Do you feel like, at some level, you're likely to be very, very wrong? I imagine it would feel a bit like having an unscratched scratchy. You could not scratch it, and tell yourself that you're a winner, but it would feel empty, because you know it's not a winner.

Honestly, no I am not worried I'm very very wrong. I'm worried your very very wrong, which is why I'm here. I have experienced God and a relationship with him first hand and maybe that's hard to believe but it's as true for me as the phone in my hands is real. Plus I'd never know if I indeed was wrong.

351,"&gt; Forgive me, but to me it seems that you are the one describing ""an extremely specific scenario.""

Yes, it is specific, to a point. But the difference is that I'm not argueing that my specific scenario is going to happen all the time, to every species. Your argument states, at least implicitly, that said scenario; where a population's easiest access to food is aquatic, will literally never happen.

&gt; To extrapolate from this that a transition from something like a cow to something like a whale has happened is not reasonable.

True, but that's not the point of this exchange. This exchange is mainly addressing your claims about the selective pressures in whale evolution. Specifically the following:

* There are no viable selective pressures that would favour a land based organism developing an aquatic lifestyle.
* A land mammal would not survive while waiting for the adaptations for aquatic lifestyles to evolve.
* The absence of direct aquatic selective pressures would drive a semi-aquatic mammal back to a land based lifestyle.

It sounds like you're conceding that selective pressures could favour whale evolution, even if you don't believe the actual evolution could or has occurred.

&gt; But when those pressuring them toward the sea go away, evolution in that direction will go away, and ""progress"" in that direction may well be lost.

Why would evolution go away from that direction, if there are not specific selective pressures away from an aquatic lifestyle?

&gt; No, I do not accept this. Why should they, when food is available in both places?

I'm sorry, I meant to say they would not exclusively seek out land based food, which is what you have said and implied when saying that the semi-aquatic mammal would revert back to their land based lifestyle when the specific selective pressures are removed.

366,"&gt;What you're describing sounds like an extremely specific scenario.

Forgive me, but to me it seems that you are the one describing ""an extremely specific scenario.""  The variable in our scenario is the migration of Species B into the land habitat of Species A.  Generally, all other things being equal, a move up or down the coast or river, or to another spot in the marsh, etc. should solve this problem.  Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, let us consider your very specific scenario.

Species B migrates into the land habitat of Species A, 
1) Species B consumes only land-based food
2) The land is unable to provide enough food for both species
3) Species B is not aggressive (so Species A will not be killed by them and can survive on land)
4) Species B does not physically crowd them off of the land with its need for shelter and space.
5) Species A is hemmed in on either side by predators or other unfavorable conditions so that it must stay at its current spot on the coast.

Under such circumstances, then I agree that Species A will become more aquatic by your definition (which does not require physical adaptions).  But by that definition, Hawaiians are more aquatic than Bedouins.  To extrapolate from this that a transition from something like a cow to something like a whale has happened is not reasonable.  It reminds me of the tortuously complicated explanations that astronomers before Copernicus went to in order to explain retrograde motion.  They came up with these explanations so that they could preserve their starting assumption that the planets orbit the earth.  The problem was the starting assumption.  In the case we are considering, the starting assumption is that whales have evolved from cows. 

&gt;When I say the selective pressure can happen in stretches, I don't mean the selective pressure would go away, and never come back.

But when those pressuring them toward the sea go away, evolution in that direction will go away, and ""progress"" in that direction may well be lost.

&gt;will not make an effort to seek out land based food, when water based food is available?

No, I do not accept this.  Why should they, when food is available in both places?

376,"Exactly, you can't quote where I claimed that because I never did.

I will admit that I originally misread what you said in your first comment. I thought you were claiming that it wouldn't be *any more* likely, which is absolutely false. Once I realized the misinterpretation, I left what I had because increasing one's odds by a factor of 486 million is not insignificant. A little bit of information can take a combinatorial guessing game from hopelessly impractical to just plain old impractical, so pointing this out is relevant.  

If it will get you off my back, I'll edit my original comment to address this distinction.

&gt;You have to demonstrate it is likely you'll figure out what my 40-character password is.

Whether it's *likely* at all isn't something that is easily answered. I don't disagree with the claim that 1/40! is still incredibly small, but it is 486 million times bigger than 1/26^40, which was the only point I was trying to make. 

&gt;Here's a start, here is a sorted list of characters for my hypothetical password:

&gt;a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z,z

Ignoring the two extra 'z' characters, you can generate 40!/15! unique passwords with that collection. That's approximately 6x10^35 passwords to check, compared to around 4x10^56 in the original unconstrained search space. I don't claim that either is practical, but one is a hell of a lot smaller. If we could check 10^35 passwords a second (not claiming that is possible or practical), searching one space would take 6 seconds while the other would still take nearly 10^14 *years*, or about 10,000 times the current age of the universe!

I'd rather not repeat myself, but the intermediate cases occur when all the elements are not unique nor identical, and the number of unique permutations can be found dividing 40! by the product of the factorials of the multiplicity of each element. We can verify that this works for the upper and lower bounds: 1 unique element with multiplicity of 40 gives 40!/40! = 1 unique permutations of the collection, while 40 unique elements each with multiplicity of 1 gives 40!/(1! \* 1! \* ... \* 1!) = 40!. You seem to have a problem with this. The math is [correct](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/zju/math/perm-comb-more.html#identical).

Your value of 26! is the number of ways you can permute a collection of unique elements. It has no relevance here because you we have a collection of 40 letters, which means we have some repetitions. In this case, your number is wrong, and you must use the formula I've explained twice now.

My ""piddly"" number of 4.86x10^8 was a *lower bound* on the *reduction factor* of the number of possible passwords you need to check if you know the characters used in the password and their respective multiplicities. In other words, the multiplicative factor by which your search space is reduced when you know the characters used in the password. 

Without knowing anything about the collection of used characters, all we can say for sure is that you need to check at least one password (if all the characters in the collection are identical) and at most 40!/2^14 passwords (if 14 of the characters are repeated once). I used a generous upper bound of 40! for simplicity and clarified that it was an approximation (in your favor).

If you have 52 unique elements and are still making passwords of length 40, everything I have said still applies and is correct, except that we can now reach the upper bound of 40! since our password can now use 40 unique characters.

Really? What did you *propose* again?

&gt; I propose that these CMB findings indicate we are special ...

And I should take your word for that? You DO realize that a proposal by the very meaning of the word bears assumptions in it by its own admission?

&gt; Plus, it's not strictly my conclusion, it's more that I accept the implication.

Plus, it's not strictly my conclusion, it's more that I accept the implication of zillions of planets in the universe for the odds of life elsewhere in the universe.

&gt; ... as supported by the incredulous reaction of several researchers.

So I should take your incredulous reaction on my proposal as evidence for my position then? Well thanks a lot for your incredulity then! Logical fallacy squared.

Plus, your proposal is not an implication, it is a *conclusion* based on the ASSUMPTION that there are no other solar systems with the same feats. Just one such eeny, meeny, miny solar system and you are stuck with 2 ""centres"" of the very same universe, your proposal (=hypothesis) is falsified and you're done.

You do not only make an assumption, it is also a HUGE one.

Moreover, to use your own words, it's not strictly my conclusion, it's more that I accept the implication of the universe harboring zillions of planets for the odds there's life elsewhere in the universe. At least *I* admit I make assumptions, being:

- if there are so many observed solar systems in the nearest vicinity around us and there are no particular reasons against, we may assume that this is a general trait of gallaxies and hence, therefore the number of planets in the universe is staggering

- if there are so dizzyingly many planets in the universe, we may assume the earth is not the only planet that has the right conditions for life (sitting in the habitational zone of its star, being rocky, having oceans, etc. etc.)

- if there is a planet that has the right conditions for life, it is very likely that live will start off there.

See? I must say very reasonable assumptions. 

And what about your assumption? Well:

- there is not a single other solar system to be found among the zillions in the universe that have the same observed allignment of their plane to anomalies in the background radiation.

A very *unreasonable* assumption in the light of the universe harboring zillions of solar systems.

And, as you see, both assumptions, yours and mine, are directly related to the very same observation that there are zillions of solar systems elsewhere in the universe. But this observation is in favor of my assumption and makes your assumption less likely.

The odds for life existing in the universe is MUCH MORE likely than the odds of our solar system being the only one among zillion others that exhibit 'special' allignment.

&gt; There are other proposals that also indicate we are in a special location. 

Proposal = hypothesis. Maybe there are zillions of solar systems in any sort of special location. No evidence. Next.

410,"Well a bunch a few people have weighed in with some really good answers, I'll add my (late) 2 cents.

Bone sucks to carbon date, no matter how old it is, it's a porous contaminate sponge. Carbon based molecules react with the calcium in bone and easily contaminate it. In fact it has to be chemically washed in an attempt to leave nothing but collagen. That doesn't always work so often there's more testing to be done in order to determine if the amino acids present in the sample match what is typically found in bone rather than come from a ground water source. Of course that wasn't done here.

The simple answer is, if you went around picking up stuff and sending it for carbon dating you would get results that look a lot like this. If you have a few hundred dollars to waste go pick up a bunch of rocks, label the sample as bone so the lab does the cleaning procedure (otherwise contamination will certainly make the sample much to young) and you'll get results that look almost exactly like this, even if the sample isn't made of carbon.

Look at their samples, there's stuff that was partially excavated and left out for 2 years. Stuff that's been in storage for 30 years in a creationist museum under unknown conditions. Stuff in which only surface scrapings were dated. Stuff that Carl Baugh(http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Carl_Baugh) has touched. That link doesn't even cover 5% of the crazy made up stuff he peddles. 

It's just a case of garbage in garbage out, no one would ever trust results from sample this bad, even if you suspected they might be 35,000 years old.

It is universally agreed that even beneficial mutations each take hundreds of generations to ""fix""  in higher mammals (this is Haldane's Dilemma). Don't be fooled into thinking that natural selection can operate on multiple mutations in parallel: there is a ""budget"", and attempting to select several mutations at once merely dilutes the selective pressure, resulting in no net gain (and in fact, selection must be simultaneously eliminating the thousands of deleterious mutations that accompany every rare beneficial mutation, which also dilutes selection pressure; and this doesn't even account for the dilution due to random death and other factors). Until you perform the difficult task of actually laying out a pathway by which this evolution can occur (and which pathway evolution skeptics claim doesn't exist, due to the nature of the specified complexity inherent in all useful information), it's your claim of common ancestry that is asserted without evidence.

&gt; Also, 100 amino acids is a laughably small protein. Like, that’s a hormone, not a structural protein. Did nobody crack a biology textbook, or, like, peruse Wikipedia before writing this silliness?

Evolution skeptics often make ""laughable"" concessions to evolutionists, thus giving every possible advantage to the evolutionists' claims. You realize, do you not, that if we used realistic protein sizes, it strengthens the evolution skeptic's case? If we used realistic numbers, evolutionists would hang their hats on hopes that evolution would proceed via tiny proteins &amp; enzymes such as human insulin (length = 51), and would not address the serious problems we wish to present and discuss.

What is laughable is the assumption that mutation operated upon by blind natural selection can account or the diversity, complexity and elegance of life.

458,"&gt; The Axis of Evil is the name give by the researchers, not me.

Yes but as you were mentioning it yourself in your first post, it can lead to wrong expectations about the real import of your posts. That's all what I meant.

&gt; Your proposal is correct, but, as far as I can tell, unobtainable in our lifetimes. So for now we are stuck with the observable facts, which have been firmly established. I'm fairly certain, as the wiki article's final entry implies, that they would explain it away, if they could. 

Let's assume that the observations were correct after all. Subsequently, the next question at stake will be: what are we allowed to conclude from these facts? Then it comes to logical and sound thinking. In science we are bound to explanations that necessarily follow from the observed facts or, at least, follow from the observed facts beyond reasonable doubt.

Here is your conclusion: 

&gt; the observed allignment of the plane of our solar system to anomalies in the background radiation concludes that our solar system is the centre of the universe.

But that conclusion does not necessarily follow from the observed facts and it's not even beyond any reasonable doubt. Because there's *very* reasonable doubt: the specific allignment of our solar system coincidences with the anomalies of the background radiation and as the plane of solar systems are determined by gravitational pertubations, there are many solar systems that could well have the same orientation as our own.

As long you can't determine the axis orientation of other solar systems, the ONLY conclusion allowed is: WE DON'T KNOW.

There is even more doubt:

1. the earth is just the third planet in our solar system. If our solar system would turn out to be the centre of the universe, it would be the sun, not the earth.

2. the sun is situated in a galaxy, the Milky Way. It is sitting in a rather mediocre location within the galactic spiral. Strange how a solar system that's part of a random galaxy, sitting rather in the outskirt of that galaxy, would all of a sudden have such a central position to the very rest of the universe. It isn't even the centre of its own galaxy.

3. as we now know that most of the nearest stars have at least one planet, we know that the number of planets in the universe must be staggering. How low the odds of life emerging on a planet might be, the sheer endless number of planets makes life elsewhere in the universe very likely. Must those life forms suffer of the delusional observation that *their* god apparently did not provide them a unique, central position in the universe? (Note: you might think that I can't actually prove that life elsewhere in th euniverse exists and you are right - but at least then allow me my own assumptions adjacent to yours...).

&gt; we are stuck with a phenomenon that makes the solar system look special, and on a galactic scale.

Now, normally, this is fairly uninteresting, but on the surface of the event horizon of a black hole (the event horizon is the point-of-no-return for light - within this boundary, even light cannot escape) these quantum fluctuations can happen such that one particle is captured by the black hole, while the other escapes.

Think about it. If you're a YEC you think all the animals in the fossil record died at the same time, the same way in the global flood. So why is it that finding human soft tissue is incredibly common, while even organic molucules from a dinosaur is incredibly rare. What causes dinosaur bones to decay much faster?

But I don't see anything obviously wrong with your argument. The problem is they'll cling to anything they want to maintain their beliefs. To them finding some organic molucules that probably used to be a dinosaur protein is the same thing as soft tissue. And dispite the fact that simular organic molecules can survive space travel they'll never even consider they may last a long time on earth.

Likewise actual soft tissue is proof of a young earth, instead of proof that soft tissue can survive the process of fossilization. We find simular stuff in amber so it's not as though this is a radically new find.

I've also had this exact same discussion about C14 in dino bones. Bone is just a terrible thing to date. It's a porous contaminate sponge. You'd never expect to get accurate dates, at or past the limits of the dating method. Sal linked me a 20 page PDF about racemic dating bones, fully half of the paper was about testing for and attempting to eliminate contaminates.

And look where they are sourcing their dinosaur ""bones"" from. Stuff kept in storage for 20 years excavated under entirely unknown conditions. Stuff prepared and donated by a young earth creationist ""museum"" in Glendive MT. Stuff collected from an exposed fossils in situ. That's pathetic, and the random results they got is exactly what you would expect to get. No one would accept these results even if you thought they might be correct.

And that last part pisses me off a little bit. I firmly believe that someone knew using samples like they did would give them the ""non-zero"" results they got. And they purposely did it anyway knowing they could convince gullible people who *want* to believe them.

It's not a death sentence. It's just a very, very big risk, one that usually doesn't pay off.

&gt;It seems plausible that the examples I might have pointed to outside the primates are no longer around because they didn't do as a good a job of getting vitamin c from their environment.

The problem is that every other organism can manufacture their own vitamin C, and we have a fragmented version of that code still in our genome.

If we never could make our own vitamin C, why do we have a fragment of a working version? Did the designer give us a broken component to confound us?

&gt; Perhaps primates are structured in such a way that they will inevitably break in this manner after some amount of time. 

You have been told over and over again: that's not how this works. If the primate version was ""structured to break"", then every version is ""structured to break"", because the primate version was the same as every other functioning version, prior to it breaking.

And it hasn't broken in the vast majority of species. It has not been ""structured to break"".

&gt;As I say, we see things like this happening in manufactured products all the time. Certain products break in certain ways for specific reasons over time. This seems like viable explanation of the facts as we observe them. 

No, it's really not. In order to get to the result we see now, every primate species in existence would require their version to break in the exact same way, at specific points in history -- or it would need to break once, in an ancient ancestor to all these species.

Our genomes are about 2% coding, and the most reasonable estimate that I've come across, and the one that I use, is that a further 8% of the genome is non-coding but still functional. This includes regulatory elements and regions (promoters, enhancers, silencers), ""check for errors"" tags that are scattered throughout our chromosomes, structural regions like centromeres and telomeres, and also ""spacer"" regions that must be a precise length to function, but not a specific sequence.

Either a majority of individuals must experience a sufficient number of de novo deleterious mutation *each generation* for their average reproductive output to fall below one, or deleterious mutations must accumulate at a sufficient rate for the average output to eventually fall below one (or some combination, so that on net the average output falls below one). [...]

&amp;nbsp;

So now to the numbers. Out of those 100 mutations, only about 10 are going to be in functional regions. 

Of those 10, most are neutral, because most mutations are neutral (or close enough to it that they are functionally neutral), even in functional DNA. One or two might even be beneficial. I've had this discussion elsewhere, and we settled on three deleterious mutations per generation, and I think that's about right, but if you want to argue it up to eight or so, that's fine, the same conclusions hold. Because...

That's too low for the first case above to happen. We aren't experiencing a sufficient number of de novo deleterious mutations each generation to experience error catastrophe. (Note not in old thread: This is obvious. If we *were* experiencing this many deleterious mutations, we wouldn't be here.) So they have to be inherited and accumulate over time. 

&amp;nbsp;

But some of these bad alleles are going to be recessive. For a large percentage of our proteins, you only need one good copy of the gene to function normally. So no fitness cost for one copy. 

Some of these mutations will be lost in subsequent generations via recombination or reversal.  

And if they are bad enough, they will be selected out of the population. In other words, the affected individuals will either die, or have fewer kids than the average person (or none at all, and then the mutations don't get passed on at all). For most of human history (with the exception of a possible bottleneck that may or may not have happened one to three hundred thousand years ago), there have been enough humans to maintain relatively strong selection and weak genetic drift. So if any seriously deleterious alleles appeared, they would be selected out pretty quickly. 

All of which means they are not accumulating at a sufficient rate to induce error catastrophe. Which means we would need a large number of de novo deleterious mutations each generation, a sufficient number to drop the average reproductive output below one. But that's obviously not happening, and as I walked through above, the math doesn't work. [...]

&amp;nbsp;

So if we're experiencing error catastrophe, what's the mechanism? The answer is there is no plausible mechanism, and we aren't experiencing error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sal is making the same argument here, so the same points hold. We're perfectly capable of dealing with more mutations per generation than we experience. ",5,1490818388,2017-03-29 16:13:08
36,"&gt;it appears UNIVERSALLY and EXCLUSIVELY in primates

I don't see how this undermines my argument, particularly when, as you point out, its appearance would typically be a death sentence for the organism.  It seems plausible that the examples I might have pointed to outside the primates are no longer around because they didn't do as a good a job of getting vitamin c from their environment.  Monkeys love fruit.  So do I.

&gt;only the once in primates

This is the point of contention.  I absolutely accept the strength of your position in this case.  I'm only suggesting another plausible explanation.  Perhaps primates are structured in such a way that they will inevitably break in this manner after some amount of time.  As I say, we see things like this happening in manufactured products all the time.  Certain products break in certain ways for specific reasons over time.  This seems like viable explanation of the facts as we observe them.

39,"u/nomenmeum, you made this thread seemingly to make the argument that common design and/or determinism are better explanations for the presence of the same mutations in different species than common ancestry. 

You posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuk5l_Lg4_4) a couple of times in this thread to refute the idea that ERVs are evidence for common ancestry. I responded to it is some detail, but you don't seem to want to discuss it. Here is my response to the claims in the video:

&amp;nbsp;

------

&gt;The interpretation is wrong.

Okay...?

&gt;MicroRNAs.

Relevant how?

&gt;Different genes give you different trees. 

Yup. We know why that happens. [Here's a simple illustration.](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/molevol-140414140408-phpapp01/95/mol-evolution-5-638.jpg?cb=1397484292) 

Takes ten minutes to get to ERVs at all. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;First paper - HERV-K

Explained within the paper: The integration occurred in the common ancestor but was not fixed; it later became fixed in the gorilla and chimp lineage but not the human lineage. [Here's the full paper.](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982201002275/1-s2.0-S0960982201002275-main.pdf) The author of the video should have read it before claiming it refuted the notion of common ancestry; it actually does the opposite. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Second paper - hotspots

Yup, there are hotspots for insertion, recombination, etc. They are not deterministic. Just have a higher probability than other regions. (We've since discussed this further, [here's a detailed study on the topic.](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020234))

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Last claim - only 7 shared ERVs out of 30k. 

I don't know why he's using that number, but it's wrong. The number of ERVs is now in the hundreds of thousands. The paper he cited is from 2000, but *the chimp genome wasn't even sequenced until 2005*, so one cannot possibly draw conclusions about genome-wide similarity before then. Video published in 2014, so the author is either uninformed or dishonest. 

The truth is that almost all human and chimp ERVs are orthologous ([source 1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html), [source 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1779541/), [plain english explanation](https://richarddawkins.net/2013/11/knockdown-argument-for-pseudoscientific-anti-evolutionists/)).

&amp;nbsp;

Unsurprisingly, the argument presented in that video do nothing to challenge the notion that ERVs strongly support the common ancestry of humans and other apes. 

------

Would you care to respond? Do you stand by the claims made in the video?

&amp;nbsp;

I have also asked you several questions about your alternative explanation, that ERVs are the result of common design, or else some deterministic mechanism, rather than common ancestry. Here are those questions:

&gt;The argument here is that a *better* explanation is that they occurred independently, because there are mechanisms that would cause similar mutations/ERVs/etc to happen in similar genomes (like the human and chimp).

&gt;How do I test this idea? We have a mechanism for the other explanation, one that's consistent with our observations and the general context within evolutionary theory. What's the mechanism for yours? What dictates that a specific mutation happens in a specific place? 

&gt;Can I actually experimentally evaluate this idea? If it's not testable and falsifiable, it's worthless as an explanation. It's just ""well it might be..."" Yup. How do you go from ""might"" to ""probably""?

Would you like to respond to any of those?

However, there are two other mammals which also lost the ability to produce vitamin C: guinea pigs and bats, though the latter has regained the ability to some level.

Guinea pigs have a fairly similar mutation to ours, but in different areas of the gene. So, we can be reasonably sure they didn't get that from us.

Now, the mutation in bats is VERY different than the primate mutation, in that they have a variant synthesis gene that still works, but is restricted strongly by regulatory sequences, and only in a few species is it functional.

58,"&gt; where did the matter on earth come from?

Stellar nucleosynthesis. This is the process by which stars produce elements heavier than hydrogen and helium through nuclear fusion. Stars, interestingly, have a life cycle, and at the end of that life, some explode violently in processes called supernovae, which spew their elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen into the cosmos, where they form nebulae which can condense into new star systems, this time with the raw materials for organic life. The first stars in the universe, if they had solar systems, would not have had small rocky worlds with oxygen, methane, or carbon dioxide atmospheres, nor would there be things like water. Only after those initial stars exploded could there be star systems with the elements you and I are made of. 

Of particular note: elements like uranium are only created in supernovae: the heaviest element produced through fusion is iron. The laws of physics do not allow for iron to be fused into larger atoms, and so a star with a sufficient amount of iron essentially runs out of fuel and the balance between the inward pull of gravity and the outward expansion from fusion is disrupted, leading to the violent collapse that precedes a supernova. It's *this* explosion that produces the heavier trace elements you'll find below iron on your periodic table.

tl;dr: Stars create heavier elements when they explode. When these heavier elements collide with each other, chemical processes combine them together. Because masses attract due to gravity, the clumps of matter continue to grow in size as they collide. In billions of years and enough orbital collisions, [planets form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System).

69,"&gt;I guess I've just always thought that creation needed a Prime Mover.

The problem with this is that asking the wrong questions will get you the wrong answers. Scientists don't ask the question of ""who created the creation"", they begin by asking not even ""was the universe created"", but go a step back even further and just ask ""how did the universe come to be"".

When you ask ""how did the universe come to be"", you're asking a very different question from ""who created creation"". The latter assumes that the universe was created, and that there is someone or something who did it. The former question is open-ended, and assumes nothing.

You're going to run into the same kind of problem when you ask questions about evolution. When you ask how evolution could have happened without an intelligent designer, it's easier to just ask how evolution could have happened, period. There are plenty of great answers out there.

So, where did matter come from exactly? We're not entirely sure, but many cosmologists and theoretical physicists have very good models.

From then we know matter coalesced into hyrogen atoms, which formed the first stars, which in their nuclear furnaces fused hydrogen into every other known element in the universe. Some atoms in your right hand probably came from a different star from some atoms in your left hand. 

From there we know about planetary accretion disks, where dust started to rotate around the sun before eventually forming all the planets of the solar system.

From there we have a decently good idea of what the earth was like before there was life on it. First it was a ball of molten rock, then it eventually cooled down enough and grew oceans and an atmosphere of mostly CO2.

Eventually, life formed. We don't know how exactly, but we know all the basic building blocks of life (sugars, amino acids, fatty acids) can and do form spontaneously and naturally without any kind of intelligent intervention needed. We don't know what this primitive life looked like exactly, but the field of abiogenesis is always looking for and turning up new models that may or may not be correct, but one step at a time they're bringing us closer to the truth.

Evolution only steps in the moment life actually exists. Evolution is strictly defined as the change in allele frequency in a gene pool over time. Evolution has nothing whatsoever to do with anything before life existed. Evolution has nothing whatsoever to do with planets, or the big bang, of where matter comes from.

From the early forms of life evolution describes how they could change and adapt to different conditions of life to create the diversity of all the living things we see today.

Evolution explains why for example we look more like chimps than any other animal on the planet, because we're most closely related to them than any other animal.

Evolution explains why you'll only find Lemurs in Madagascar, and kangaroos in Australia, and why you'll find mice and rats and wolves and foxes throughout Aurasia and the Americas, or why there are penguins only at the south pole and polar bears only on the north pole.

Evolution is an incredibly well-tested scientific hypothesis. It makes predictions you can test, and it is falsifiable, meaning that it can fail the test and show us we've got something wrong, there's something we don't understand, and we need to look at it more.

Intelligent design, by comparison, is not a scientific hypothesis. It is not falsifiable. No matter what test you do and what answer you get, you can always say ""the designer designed it that way"". It's not science.

82,"&gt; where did the matter that was present at the Big Bang come from?

As others here have pointed out, this isn't a biology question. You should ask cosmologists. 

Knowing a little bit about cosmology, I can say that (according to the current accepted model) matter didn't exist at the moment of the Big Bang - it was too hot and dense for matter to exist. Atoms (with nuclei and electrons) didn't exist until about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. 

A better question would be: where did the *energy* that resulted in matter come from? From the cosmologists I've read, they seem to think that the entire energy of the universe, if you add it all up, adds to zero. You can imagine an analogy here, involving you digging a hole, and moving the earth to a nearby hill. If the dirt above the ground is positive energy, then the hole would be negative energy, and the hole + hill  = zero. In fact, we see this happening with quantum fluctuations, where [a particle and its anti-particle partner are created out of ""nothing"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production) Of the cosmologists I've read, some have commented that the creation of the universe could have happened in a similar manner, and that the ""negative energy"" isn't around, though dark matter or dark energy could be a clue to understanding where it went, but we're not sure yet.

Worse still, [cosmologists haven't reached a consensus yet on whether the universe *had* a beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgpvCxDL7q4). It could be turtles all the way down.

Here's [a summary of the timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Summary), a lot of which is corroborated by [strong observational evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Observational_evidence).

My advice: check /r/askscience to see if it's been asked before. I'm guessing yes, and the answers there will be more complete and more accurate than anything folks here could provide, as again, this is a biology and biochemistry-related sub.

Won't change the rest of the mutations, which again are the clear majority.

121,"Not when I don't go on a tangent about how we actually do this. Meaning, comparing genomes is a mess. We can compare genomes on sequence basis and give out a number of how many bases are different (substitutions).

Short things short, the genome similarity on a sequence level is around 98.8%. That is when we only look at the substitutions in the base building blocks of shared genes. How much DNA was left out of the equation because of duplications, deletions or insertions? Beats me, I had to search it myself right now and the number 4-5% seems about right.

Mutations aren't the only thing affecting a genome with time, and mutations aren't just the standard ""replace one base with another"" process.

But those differences in percentage can be attributed to the ~10 million years of genetical separation that humans and chimps had.

123,"&gt; If I understand you, you are speaking of inheriting mutations rather than experiencing them, right? Is it appropriate to compare the two?

Yes, because in my example, you induce mutagenesis and then look at the DNA. No selective processes, and the mutations are not accumulated via replication, but mutagenesis. Same principle, but essentially excluding evolution.

&gt; Here are some studies that I recently came across that seem to conclude that independent mutations are reasonable to expect.

With selective processes, absolutely. No need for me to even read your examples, because it's a fact. 

None the less, this does not change the initial assumption. Independent mutations in two populations always happen along side non-independent different mutations, and we don't expect most mutations to be able to fixate independently in two populations. This can also be easily proven. In order for a specific mutation to be favored in independent populations, it needs to experience positive selection. Most mutations are silent (i.e. demonstrably fitness neutral) so we can discount a large number of mutations from being selected for or against. Those types of mutations don't have a chance to be fixated in two independent populations.

To bring this conclusion into the context of your posted examples, those examples always focus on the mutations that arose independently. That doesn't support the claim that every other mutation in the same genome is also the same. It only supports the claim that independent mutations are *possible* when focusing on a specific locus, which I don't deny. And as explained above, the rest of the mutations are very *very* likely not the same. I would be repeating myself at this point.",1,1490727314,2017-03-28 14:55:14

I just took a quick look at this, and what's very clear about this is that this is an analysis about an evolution experiment. It's essentially an experiment highlighting the adaptiveness of bacteriophages when they aren't identical but were put trough the same environment.


What this means, in easy terms, is that the experiment shows that when you put different populations of a bacteriophage into an environment where certain mutations are favored, those mutations will prevail because they are selected for. The key word here is selected.

The thing is, the example we are talking about is too obvious. We already know that mutations behave randomly on DNA. That isn't a deduction and requires observation only, nothing else. We can test this very simply by taking 1000 strands of completely identical DNA and inducing mutagenesis. The result is very clear, mutations do not affect identical DNA the same. And the results are not even close to being identical. We're talking about a 1 in a (insert biggest number you can write on a post-it note) chance of the mutations being on the same place. No doubt about that, it's is a fact of life, and even if we didn't know (but we know) what is happening, we can observe the randomness of mutations anyway.",1,1490725823,2017-03-28 14:30:23
132,"&gt; If chimps and humans, being so similar, are ""loaded"" to mutate in similar ways, then the odds are not as astronomical as you are imagining.

Statistically speaking, the odds are very astronomical. DNA bias exists, but it isn't nearly as strong as you might imagine.

Just so you have a general idea of how astronomical the odds really are:

Two humans have a child and humans usually give around 30-50 new mutations to their child. So they have one child and the second child will also have around 30-50 new mutations. Now what are the odds that two separate siblings are identical because they inherited the exact same 30-50 mutations? What are the odds that your sister or brother are a clone of you? The odds lie in the trillions already. And that's one human generation. No way two completely separate species are having kids while having the exact same mutations, doesn't even matter if the two species are very closely related, genetically or historically.

In the big picture, chimpanzees and humans were one lineage since life first started existing. Around 13-10 million years ago, the geographical split of two subpopulations slowly stopped us from being able to reproduce. So since around 10 mya, we are genetically isolated and there's no way we and chimps are experiencing the same mutations. As explained above, such a case would be truly astronomical.",2,1490725439,2017-03-28 14:23:59

&gt;First, Dzugavili makes the flawed assumption a genetic defect in the dad necessarily means the sperm will die! Not so. Sperm with defective genes can still pass on defective genes to the offspring as long as the genes in the sperm don't cause the sperm to die, that is a known fact.

&gt;Second, the woman generally uses only 1 ovum egg in the process, so that explanation does work for maternal inheritance, plus it suffers also from the flawed assumption that bad genes in the ovum egg necessarily mean the ovum egg would not be viable to make embryos.

I also covered this:

135,"&gt; Are you saying that if you could run the same experiment again, and all the variables affected each other in exactly the same way, that there is no reason to think that the outcome will be the same?

In the case you just described, yes the outcome would be the same.

BUT I think this nice thread was full of good explanations why mutations are random and don't happen in predictable ways. So that would be a variable that you can't control and thus couldn't say:

&gt; all the variables affected each other in exactly the same way

Because mutations don't have to and **won't** affect DNA in the same way in a repeated situation.

So in an experiment where you take several completely identical DNA strands and induce mutagenesis, the outcome is not going to be the same. Same thing here, if you took one strand of DNA, induces mutagenesis and then went back in time to induce mutagenesis again, the outcome would not be the same. This is including the fact that DNA might have biased sited where mutations are more likely.

And this conclusion is why /u/DarwinZDF42 said:

I'm unaware of any evidence pointing to specific genes that are ""loaded"" to mutate in specific ways - if you have evidence to the contrary, please share it, because I'm pretty sure that goes against everything we know about mutation.

&gt;It seems like the same reasoning would apply to ERVs.

No, actually:  ERVs are viruses, or rather the broken genetic insertions of said viruses in to our DNA.  They really do insert randomly - it's not as though a virus can chose where it puts its load, it just kinda *goes in*.

Since they don't arise from the system they influence, the outcomes are difficult to predict.

&gt; Surely even irregular behavior can be attributed to intention.

This isn't irregular behaviour -- it's completely regular behaviour. The decay of radioactive particles is statistically predictable, but the outcomes of that event are less so.

There's no conscious entity indicated, so no intention can be suggested.

Lets examine this shall we.

&gt;Suppose the measured range of amino dates is 30,000 to 2,000,000 years, it means it can't be 40,000,000 years or 400,000,000 years. So the imprecision is moot when even the most extreme possible value of age is still 20 to 200 times below what it should be.

Except that's not the supposed age of the shell. I'll quote the relevant section of the paper, which, this shouldn't surprise you, is the sentence that immediately precedes what he quoted. 

&gt;D-alloisoleucine/L-isoleucine ratio as a function of molecule size in protein from a **Late Pleistocene** Mercenaria shell (**putative age in the 10-300 thousand year range**) yielded the data in Table 1 (Kriausakul and Mitterer 1980a). *On the basis of the D/L ratio for the total shell, from Figure 4 this shell could be assigned an age anywhere in the range between about 30,000 years and about 2,000,000 years*

Italics is the sentence he quoted, bold for emphasis. /u/stcordova it says right there in your very own source that this isn't a 40,000,000 or a 400,000,000 y/o shell, its a &lt;300,000 y/o shell. And the amino acid dating method dates it **older** than what it actually is. Seriously, you purposely omitted the sentence that included the age of the sample, and substitute one that's entirely of you're own imagination. 

/u/JoeCoder I've asked you to defend this behavior from Sal in the past. Did he just not read his own source again? Did he not understand what the Late Pleistocene is, or what the word putative means? I hate to drag you into this since this isn't a subject you've been debating, but last week you did insinuate that we shouldn't be calling creationists liars.

I've done long-term mutation accumulation experiments. I set up viral populations, let them grow overnight, then transfer them to new host populations. After a few months of this, I sampled the populations and sequenced the genomes to see what mutations appeared.

&amp;nbsp;

There are two steps in this process that could be considered random. First, the mutations that appeared through either spontaneous chemical reactions or polymerase error. Second, the loss of diversity due to the bottleneck at each transfer. 

&amp;nbsp;

According to you, if I was able to go back in time and repeat this experiment *exactly*, or rewind the tape, reset the conditions, and do it again, I should see the *exact* same set of mutations.

Because selection is not all powerful, it is limited by the effective size of the population. Evolution is best thought as a stochastic sieve

If the effective size of the population is lower than roughly the inverse of the selection coefficient, the allele behaves effectivel neutrally. 

This has corollaries:

1. Most evolution is neutral or nearly neutral
2. Not everything that is adaptive gets fixed and not everything that is maladaptive gets weeded out
3. The lineages with the lowest effective population sizes have been shaped by the fixation of maladaptive alleles to the highest extent.

However, it doesn't matter how much knowledge we have about the hill, every single stone and every single pebble on top of this hill: The next day, a bird will fly by and touch one of the stones and make it fall, and the ability to predict the bird one day before (looking into the future) is not very small, also not extremely small, but effectively **zero**. Because the bird, the variable, didn't affect the playing field before.

And just to illustrate this problem and show that such an example exists in our reality: UV light can induce adjacent pyrimidine bases in a DNA strand to become covalently joined as a [pyrimidine dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer). We actually understand everything about this process down to the atoms, but the only thing left to know is where and when this excited photon will hit the DNA. But we don't know this, and can't possibly know this unless we can trace every single photon travel direction and the only way we could observe this is under intense observation.

Now that is not absolutely true, but only to an extent -- the DNA repair mechanisms are of course themselves shaped by selection, and thus the mutation spectrum is influenced by selection (up to the limits imposed by the drift barrier). 

But that is a statistical distribution over the whole genome and over many generations.

The author points out instances in which the sample had been contaminated with ground water (page 16) The rate of racemization is also pH dependent, [ANOTHER PDF](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1982.tb12709.x/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.ca&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED) It's also dependent on mechanism of racemization [MORE PDF's](https://sakai.udel.edu/access/content/user/42339/Wehmiller_Pubs/wehmilleretal1976gca.pdf) the researchers studied corals, and ended up getting non-linear results (enantimor ratio with respect to age)  leading them to conclude that this isn't a simple 1st order reaction. It's also temp dependent. The rule of thumb is generally an increase of 10C doubles the rate of a chemical reaction. You could imagine the problem this poses since getting reliable dates would require someone to know the average temp of a sample over 10,000's of years.

There are several causes for mutations. Mutations trough molecular decay and radiation, mutations trough error-prone replication, mutations trough errors in DNA repair and mutations induced by mutagens.

In short, the types of mutations in existence are way more complicated than the simple ""one base gets replaced by another one"" summary that most people have in mind.


---

The reason why mutations are random is not because of their unknown cause (there are still some mechanisms that might be hidden but also cause mutations, plus there's a lot of research into which mechanisms cause the most mutations etc.), but because of their general **spontaneity** and **unpredictability**.

Granted, we can tell that there are certain spots where more or less mutations occur compared to other spots, but those differences are mostly of structural nature and depend on where in the Chromosome the DNA in question lies in. We can also predict the amount of mutations per generation, or the amount of mutations accumulated in a human skin cell, and how many of those mutations where caused by which specific mechanism by looking at what kind of mutation it is, but all of this still doesn't change the fact that we can't predict one single mutation at a specific locus. That process remains relatively **random**.

So 1) is wrong and 2) is partially wrong. The correct answer is a hybrid. We know the cause, but it's still unpredictable.

___

How about this analogy:

We have a mountain where rocks randomly fall down on one side. While we are able to tell you exactly how many rocks fell in one year, and what the cause was (lets say wind, humans, birds and rain) and we can even characterize the fallen rocks by weight, density and color.

But at the end of all these examinations, the rocks are still falling randomly. No geologist or physicist will be able to tell you the exact minute the next rock will break loose, and likely never will be. The rocks are falling randomly.

I hope this was a good analogy.

---

Next point:

&gt; To me, this makes plausible the idea that those mutations we share with chimps appeared independently in human and chimp genomes. True, the probability that the mutation occurred in one individual (an ancestor common to both chimps and humans) rather than in two (the ancestor common to all humans and the ancestor common to all chimps) is greater, but in the overall scheme of things, this difference does not seem very significant to me, especially once one concedes that the mutation is a result of particular (though unknown) causes which are likely to affect individuals with comparable genetic structures in the same way.

I absolutely see your point. If mutations have known causes and the causes are sometimes specific to the DNA, that means that we expect similar genomes to possibly experience mutations at similar loci. So for example, if humans have mutation hotspots in Region A, we could form a hypothesis to expect a similar hotspot in Region A of chimpanzees. This is an absolutely correct and valid hypothesis. It's also not incorrect. Mutations do have a certain bias of occurring in specific regions in humans (as already said before), and we don't expect the same rules to look that much differently in chimpanzees.

I think the best answer here is to regard the following. When looking at the common ancestry of humans and chimpanzees, we look at many other clues in our genomes and we don't just focus on where mutations are scattered in humans and chimps.

You actually addressed this yourself here and I agree with this, there's nothing to correct here:

&gt; True, the probability that the mutation occurred in one individual (an ancestor common to both chimps and humans) rather than in two (the ancestor common to all humans and the ancestor common to all chimps) is greater [...]

And I say the same. Two independent lineages having the same mutations that appears twice at the same place? Common ancestry sounds more plausible.

So when we move on to the next part here:

&gt; but **in the overall scheme of things**, this difference does not seem very significant to me

Because **in the overall scheme of things**, we look at way more evidences than you would probably expect in order to strengthen the conclusion of common ancestry. That is how the overall scheme of things looks like.

We are just talking about 1 of them right now. In reality, we look at ALL of them **simultaneously** and we'd expect each of them to line up conclusively.

Thank you for this brilliant post!

&amp;nbsp;

If you're interested, I'm just gonna list down a couple of things biologists generally do to lay down the evidence of common ancestry from the simplest to the most complex ones of the top of my head:


* comparative anatomy (homology, atavism, vestigiality, Evolutionary developmental biology, 

* comparative biochemistry (Human Chr. 2 Fusion -&gt; fantastic evidence)

* genetic similarity

* homologous mutations versus unshared mutations (the one we discussed right now)

* phylogenetic reconstructions (genes or proteins, mitochondrial DNA, also ribosomal RNA)

* Shared/unshared pseudogenes, repeats, transposons, Endogenous Retroviruses

* Cytochrome c and b variation

* mathematical and biogeographical models of human migration used as predictive tools

* human fossils (this alone already led people to the correct conclusion without anything of the above)

Biologists have to look at all of this together to come to a conclusion, and don't do so by only focusing at one specific topic.

Here's the rest of the list:

217,"The conclusion of [his offered link](http://www.grisda.org/origins/12008.htm) actually suggests that in two ways:

&gt;At the present time **there is insufficient knowledge concerning the effective average racemization rate in a sample as a function of time to justify dependence on D/L ratios for a quantitative determination of fossil age**. 

...and...

&gt;In addition to the wide range of fossil age associated with a given value of a racemization rate constant and the wide range of racemization rate constant associated with a given fossil age, **there is a dominant trend for the effective racemization rate constant to decrease with putative fossil age**.",3,1490631839,2017-03-27 12:23:59
218,"&gt;What do evolutionists mean by random mutation?

Uncontrolled mutation. For example, a virus introduces a controlled mutation -- it knows what it is doing. But a random break, such as from a stellar ray, is truly random.

In short: random doesn't mean ""no cause"", just ""not intended"".

&gt;To me, this makes plausible the idea that those mutations we share with chimps appeared independently in human and chimp genomes.

Some of them, yes. Certain structures in DNA are more likely to have certain errors, and thus certain mutations are likely to repeat.

But mutation is constant, and we can see errors written on top of errors. This would allow us to get a better idea of when the changes first arose.",2,1490631721,2017-03-27 12:22:01
219,"Or we could just use radiometric dating and get an accurate, verifiable answer?",9,1490631603,2017-03-27 12:20:03
220,"You can use the phrase ""random mutations"" several ways. 

It can mean ""approximately equally likely,"" for example. This is often the case in a very general sense, but there are very frequently exceptions in terms of locations or types of mutations. To give you two examples:

ssDNA viruses experience C--&gt;T mutations more frequently than other types (A--&gt;G, T--&gt;C, etc). 

In animal genomes, mutations are more common on the non-coding strand within the exons of highly expressed genes, since that strand is often single-stranded and not densely packed.

So you get biases in mutation spectra across a genome.

&amp;nbsp;

Or ""random mutation"" can mean ""undirected,"" i.e. the result of spontaneous processes operating with a predictable frequency or probability, but not acting on any specific sequence, region, etc. I prefer this definition, since it includes things like those I described above. One can also call these mutations ""spontaneous."" 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, this is *not* to say that the cause or mechanism is unknown. The two options in the OP are not all-inclusive. They leave out situations where the mechanism is known, but it operates approximately randomly. 

For example, sticking with one of the above situations, we know the mechanism of C--&gt;T mutations in ssDNA viruses (spontaneous cytosine deamination), and we know *why* they experience those mutations faster than others (unpaired cytosine is more susceptible to spontaneous deamination). But that doesn't make these mutations *not random*. Any given cytosine is approximately as likely as any other to deaminate. We know the mechanism, we can calculate the frequency, but the occurrence itself, in any single cytosine, is still random. 

&amp;nbsp;

So...

&gt;To me, this makes plausible the idea that those mutations we share with chimps appeared independently in human and chimp genomes. True, the probability that the mutation occurred in one individual (an ancestor common to both chimps and humans) rather than in two (the ancestor common to all humans and the ancestor common to all chimps) is greater, but in the overall scheme of things, this difference does not seem very significant to me, especially once one concedes that the mutation is a result of particular (though unknown) causes which are likely to affect individuals with comparable genetic structures in the same way.

I don't really see how these two things are connected. We're talking about mutation-causing processes operating over billions of nucleotides. And because we, what, can't predict *exactly* where a mutation will occur, or don't always know *exactly* what mechanism caused a specific mutation (sometimes we do, or at leave have a good idea), it's more likely that the exact same mutation appeared twice in two different lineages? Not buying it. ",4,1490631316,2017-03-27 12:15:16
221,"Thankfully, he provided me a [link with some numbers](http://www.grisda.org/origins/12008.htm).

&gt;The survival of amino acids in fossils from the Paleozoic era and the trend for the apparent racemization rate constant to decrease with conventional fossil age assignment raise a serious question concerning the accuracy with which radioisotope age data have been used to represent the real-time history of fossils.

I've been aware of this process since, oddly, looking up the process for synthesizing cocaine. Interestingly enough, it is possible to perform a full synthesis of cocaine, but it produces roughly 50/50 of the two chiralities and only one of these is psychoactive in humans. Natural cocaine, being natural, produces only the active isomer normally and they've never found synthetic cocaine where the conversion has been completed.

But that's an aside for a different time. What's wrong with this then?

I suspect the problem might be how we calculate the racemization [???] rate and the bad assumptions that it will reach a 50/50 concentration.

The problem in amino acid dating, it's far more complicated than cocaine.

&gt; Four of the amino acids that make up proteins — isoleucine, threonine, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine — have two asymmetric carbon atoms which produce four structural possibilities for the same chemical composition.

So, we end up with many, many more degradation products than a normal half-life operation.

...and...well, the conclusion agrees with me, that amino acid dating is unreliable as fuck, as the rates of conversion are all over the place and the dependence on various environmental factors is incredibly confounding:

&gt;Due to the strong dependency of racemization rates on temperature, water concentration, and alkalinity, uncertainties regarding conditions of preservation can leave age relationships among even similar fossils open to question. When age relationships can be established on a firm independent basis, in some cases D/L ratios can be a guide to paleotemperature.

&gt;  At the present time there is insufficient knowledge concerning the effective average racemization rate in a sample as a function of time to justify dependence on D/L ratios for a quantitative determination of fossil age. The present status of amino acid dating can be summarized by the conclusion from the 19th International Symposium on Archeometry and Archaeological Prospection that ""the time when [amino acid racemization] can provide a problem-free dating service is still some way off"" (Hedges 1979). The literature since 1979 indicates an increasing awareness of the uncertainties in using amino acid D/L ratios as indicators of age.

In short, creationist nonsense. Amino acid dating is not appropriate for most materials anyway. It seems it's actually suggested for use in determining the temperature the fossil has been exposed to, using radiometric dating to establish age.",6,1490631110,2017-03-27 12:11:50

That's the hypothesis behind irreducible complexity, but creationists have had trouble finding definitive examples of such things.

&gt; This means the DNA sequence must simultaneously be functional for the protein it codes for as well as multiple micro RNA targets, as well providing binding sites for many histone modifying complexes, as well as providing binding sites for gene regulation complexes that may not even be on the same chromosome.

Right, but the question I was asking before is how specific these binding sites are, and that's the real issue. If they're not all that specific, then such features would not be irreducibly complex.",3,1490496149,2017-03-25 22:42:29

&gt;But the question is are these special features the reason it can't evolve, or is it just because you believe functionality can't evolve, period? Or in other words, if you could be convinced functionality was selected for, would you consider your argument refuted?

I never said functionality can't be select for.  I should point out selection can't select for non existent features. Just because a functional heart is selected for in humans in the present day, does not at all imply such hearts were select for before they existed!

&gt;But the question is are these special features the reason it can't evolve, or is it just because you believe functionality can't evolve, period? Or in other words, if you could be convinced functionality was selected for, would you consider your argument refuted?


The features first are poly constrained features.  Polyconstrained means it must mean many requirements of function, not just one.  Man-made software is moderately poly constrained, for example.  It's very hard to gradually evolve by random variation one functional set of software to another, much like randomly evolving a novel to another novel by random mutation.  Sure one could say the intermediate forms can be selected for in evolving one novel to another, but the problem in life is that many times intermediate forms would be lethal, and selection stops because the organism is dead.

A gene is more than a protein coder, it acts as a scaffold for molecular machines for other genes according to cell type.  This means the DNA sequence must simultaneously be functional for the protein it codes for as well as multiple micro RNA targets, as well providing binding sites for many histone modifying complexes, as well as providing binding sites for gene regulation complexes that may not even be on the same chromosome.

To understand the difficulties of these layers of polyconstraints, consider transcription factories and the FIRRE lincRNA.

Here are some links:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factories

and for FIRRE you'll see genes from 4 chromsomes pulled together into a transcription factory/topological domain.  For this to happen the genes need special sequences on them for FIRRE to attach (bind) to them:

A person who experiences inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to try to reduce the cognitive dissonance occurring, and actively avoids situations and information likely to increase the psychological discomfort.

For example, there is no gradualistic change from the transcription/translation strategies between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Right. But the question is are these special features the reason it can't evolve, or is it just because you believe functionality can't evolve, period? Or in other words, if you could be convinced functionality was selected for, would you consider your argument refuted?

&gt; Actually its often selected against, and Darwinists are so oblivious to it. Look at all the complex species going extinct under the increased selection pressure due to man taking away habitats.

Can I ask, is this your only reasoning for your idea that functionality is selected against/not selected for?

&gt; The microRNA targets on genes are many per microRNAs.

Interesting. I've done a bit of reading on miRNA regulation, but all I can find are lengthy scientific papers, and I don't have the time today to read them fully. So there's a lot I'm not aware of, so correct me if I'm not aware of something regarding miRNAs.

Are these binding sites based on specificity towards those binding sites, or a lack of specificity? If miRNAs are fairly short, something in the range of 20 nucleotides, then is it possible their compatibility towards numerous other genes is just down to luck? In other words they just happen to regulate some of the genes that also regulate them. This sounds probable if the specific arrangement of regulation systems isn't particularly harmful or advantageous. 

Another question regarding this regulation: Are these regulation interconnections by a single degree of separation? Eg. gene X regulates miRNA Y, which regulates gene X. Or is it more common for them to have multiple degrees of separation? If it's multiple degrees of separation, there would be a greater chance of it occurring through luck.",2,1490407524,2017-03-24 22:05:24

When I studied evolutionary biology in graduate school during the mid-1960s, official rebuke and derision focused upon Richard Goldschmidt, a famous geneticist who, we were told, had gone astray. Although 1984 creeps up on us, I trust that the world will not be in Big Brother's grip by then. **I do, however, predict that during this decade Goldschmidt will be largely vindicated in the world of evolutionary biology.**

&gt;Yeah, Darwin was a dick.


Jattok argued for the RNA world.  He seems to be under the mistaken impression natural selection tends to favor the evolution of complexity rather than simplicity.

Let him be reminded of this experiment:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman%27s_Monster
&gt;Spiegelman introduced RNA from a simple bacteriophage Qβ (Qβ) into a solution which contained Qβ's RNA replicase, some free nucleotides, and some salts. In this environment, the RNA started to be replicated.[1][2] After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated.[3]

&gt;Shorter RNA chains were able to be replicated faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. Such a short RNA had been able to be replicated very quickly in these unnatural circumstances.

&gt;In 1997, Eigen and Oehlenschlager showed that the Spiegelman monster eventually becomes even shorter, containing only 48 or 54 nucleotides, which are simply the binding sites for the reproducing enzyme RNA replicase.[4]


So simplicity is favored over complexity.  Does that figure into any of Jattok's analysis of the RNA world?  A self catalytic replicating RNA enzyme that takes a shorter replicating cycle in the RNA world will be favored over one that takes a longer replicating cycle.  

Darwin had his theory so backward.  Natural selection tends to select for simplicity and not complexity.  Complexity is a liability in inter-species competition.",0,1490381934,2017-03-24 14:58:54

Spiegelman's Monster is interesting, but expected in those conditions - the real world is far more complicated and interesting than that.

Your initial question, by definition, asks for speculation.

Not having created such an organism in the lab doesn’t mean the first principles of this model aren’t sound.  If you want to argue about this primordial organism, that is for another thread.  Remember you asked:

&gt; Now, since topoisomerase is so important to DNA replication and transcription, how did topoisomerase evolve since the creature would likely be dead without it, and if the creature is dead, how will it evolve.

Agreed, but none of these are experimentally tested ideas of minimal life.  Ventner has the best experimental model.

&gt;For example, there is some evidence that the first DNA genomes were viruses (while cellular life was RNA) and that topoisomerase is viral in origin. 


I'm sorry that's speculation, not well attested experimental evidence.

&gt; This fits well with the phylogenomics of topo enzymes and also avoids any chicken/egg problem.

Phylogenomics is circular reasoning, not actual computation of probable chemical evolution from first principles of physics, math, and chemistry.
",-2,1490377138,2017-03-24 13:38:58
421,"&gt; So even if some genomes (like plasmid genomes) don't require topoisomerase, that doesn't negate the fact topoisomerases are essential for life as we know it.

You’re right that topoisomerase is essential for cellular life as we know it, but that’s not really the point.  All cellular life as we know it has large chromosomes and/or is circular, so of course these enzymes are essential now.  But no scientist believes that modern life reflects the type of cell that first evolved topoisomerases.

&gt; But this does not negate the chicken and egg paradox for real known life that involves double stranded DNA. How did double stranded systems evolve without topoisomerase?

My whole point is that there is in fact no chicken/egg paradox, because topoisomerases aren’t a prerequisite for dsDNA.  You only need such enzymes if you have a circular genome or large chromosomes, which isn’t what the ancestral system would have had.  Thus, a clear progression from RNA to dsDNA to large/circular chromosomes is possible.

&gt; All experiments suggests minimal genomes of self-sustaining living systems with metabolisms are large enough to require topoisomerase.

These are all minimal **bacterial** genomes, i.e. circular.  This topology necessitates having a topoisomerase (because after replication the circular genomes must be decatenated).  If we could engineer a linear minimal genome, it shouldn’t need topoisomerase if small enough.  This is actually supported by the Ventner bug you linked: Topo IV acts primarily to decatenate replicated chromosomes, while Topo I primarily removes supercoils.

The bottom line is that there is no chicken/egg dilemma with the model I proposed (and answers your initial question).  Note that there are other models equally viable.  For example, there is some evidence that the first DNA genomes were viruses (while cellular life was RNA) and that topoisomerase is viral in origin.  This fits well with the phylogenomics of topo enzymes and also avoids any chicken/egg problem.",3,1490376928,2017-03-24 13:35:28

In the following I discuss some of these difficulties, some of the alternative hypotheses that have been proposed, and some of the problems with these alternative models. From a biosynthetic – as well as, arguably, evolutionary – perspective, DNA is a modified RNA, and so the chicken-and-egg dilemma of “which came first?” boils down to a choice between RNA and protein.

&gt;Background

Mere possibility is not an adequate basis for asserting scientific plausibility. A precisely defined universal bound is needed beyond which the assertion of plausibility, particularly in life-origin models, can be considered operationally falsified. But can something so seemingly relative and subjective as plausibility ever be quantified? Amazingly, the answer is, ""Yes."" A method of objectively measuring the plausibility of any chance hypothesis (The Universal Plausibility Metric [UPM]) is presented. A numerical inequality is also provided whereby any chance hypothesis can be definitively falsified when its UPM metric of ξ is &lt; 1 (The Universal Plausibility Principle [UPP]). Both UPM and UPP pre-exist and are independent of any experimental design and data set.
....
If the highest estimate of the number of elementary particles in the Universe is used (e.g., 10^89), the UPB would be 10^149.

Given the size of any given pebble, roughly one in 10^26 or more; that this atom was placed there is so improbable, given 1 million random chances to place it per second, it would take you on average 3 TRILLION years to place it correctly. So, what does this mean, that pebbles are too improbable, and therefore, god? No. What we're discussing is a field of chemistry called Statistical Thermodynamics. Any given configuration of matter is equally and infinitely improbable, but ultimately, the system must exist in one state or another. 

If we release a ball in the air, and ask what direction it will travel, it's trivial to show that any given direction is equally and infinitely improbable... but ultimately, the population of directions that the ball will travel is not governed by chance, but rather, by the gravitational force. Chance has little to do with it; it will travel in the direction determined by gravity.  

With this in mind, the population of states explored by the system of a pebble, just as with a genetic system, is explored not by chance, but by a force or forces.

14,"If I may add my own little bit on ERVs:

All humans have certain ERVs in the same place in every human genome, showing that a common ancestor existed in which the ERV was inserted. 
Now, humans and chimps also have certain ERVs in common, found in the exact same place in the human and chimp genomes. Chimps have some that humans don't, and vice versa, but the fact that they share some in common cannot be explained by ID. 
There are also further ERVs, some of which are found solely in gorilla genomes and others which are shared between human, chimp and gorilla genomes (again, in the exact same places in their respective genomes). 
This is incredibly strong evidence for common ancestry and cannot be explained by common design. 
We then find another layer, in ERVs that are shared by humans, chimps, gorillas and orang utans (with some more that are restricted to orangs). 
If ERVs shared by all hominids at each level of common ancestry weren't enough, we find the same pattern in all hominoids, and so on even to all primates. 
There is a further layer to this evidence, and that is the age of the insertions. The theory of evolution predicts that ERVs found at identical loci across a wide range of species must have been inserted earlier than ERVs shared across fewer species. How can we test this? 
Simple. ERVs involve what is called Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), which is a string of repeating segments of DNA used to protect the promoters during insertion. As these are repeating parts of originally identical DNA sequences, if we examine the LTRs and find out how many mutations there are, we can use the average rate of mutations to determine how old the ERV insertion is, and compare it to other ERV insertions. 
What we find is exactly what the theory of evolution predicts, with the ERVs common to humans and chimps only having LTRs with much fewer mutations than the ERVs which are shared by all hominoids, which themselves contain fewer mutations than the ERVs shared by all primates. 


This cannot be accounted for by common design. 
Indeed, the mutations within the older ERVs also falls into nested hierarchies, which also supports the model of common ancestry predicted by the theory of evolution.
This means that Endogenous Retroviruses give three levels of very strong support to the theory of evolution (and common descent in particular) and directly contradicts Intelligent Design.

Not 2, not 3, but it looks like it's probably just 1 common ancestor that we nicknamed LUCA, which isn't the first life to begin with either, just the universal common ancestor. And we have a lot of reason to believe that it's one. That is a deductive conclusion, not an inductive one, it's not a statement of knowledge.

It's like saying that a car that goes from B to C likely started at A and not at Z. We conclude that with the direction of the traveling car and we have no idea how A looks like. So the above statement doesn't mean that we are stating that we know exactly how A looks like, or what kind of location it is, or basically anything else. We're just pointing at that direction.


The point here is, none of that uncertainty about LUCA and prior has anything to do with the present. To continue the analogy, we have plenty of evidence of our analogy car being at point C,D,F and G and we do have evidence of how long the car was there. We also understand the processes and mechanisms in which that car travels.

So in contrast, it doesn't matter one bit if we had **NO** idea about how A looks like, because we do have a rock-steady idea of how the consecutive points look like.

125,"This ""faith in science construction"" is one of the most pernicious and enduring forms of theistic equivocation. Let’s review: It’s self-evident that when I do a physics lab assignment and test out Newton’s laws, I don’t have to have faith. I make observations which either correspond with the laws or they don’t. If I’m unsure, I can ask someone else to observe with me. If we both find a discrepancy, either I made a mistake in my procedure, or I’ve discovered a new property of matter.

For a theist to claim that lab work requires faith is clear equivocation. At the risk of being highly tedious and pedantic, let me just reiterate what I mean: confidence in careful procedures and collection of evidence is not the same as your unevidenced faith in the supernatural. This sort of equivocation comes up all the time, though. It’s part of the immune system of the theistic memeplex. I posit that this equivocation comes from a deep-seated knowledge that their beliefs are not supportable. The emperor really isn’t wearing clothes, and they know it at some level. They learned something they couldn't refute, and so they had a choice: they could remain honest, or they could remain creationist, but they could no longer be both. The part of their brain which normally would question such belief on insufficient evidence has been shunted permanently into bypass mode. It's readily apparent that this is the case, too: while they accept their mythology without any overt questions, tell them the paint is wet and they'll still touch it to check! No one wants to feel deficient, so they play up the virtues of this ""cognitive bypass"" and call it ""faith."" They’ve traded truth for comfort as a survival strategy which allows them to maintain the requisite levels of cognitive dissonance.

But they can’t completely shut down their critical thinking, which gives them a permanent inferiority complex, albeit at an unconscious level. Though they may have outer comfort, they still feel the sands shifting beneath their feet, because they know they can’t be sure they’ve chosen the ""right"" belief system out of the countless thousands possible. The more time they have devoted to the system they chose, the more the bypassed critical thinking skills will have atrophied, and the more likely they are to defend their faith to the death. Knowing they suffer from this insurmountable uncertainty, they simply must attempt to level the playing field. (To do so, many have devoted lifetimes or built entire libraries of theological texts based on their presuppositionalism – essentially intellectual castles in the sky.)

Rather than take the difficult and painstaking steps of learning to live within the confines of evidence-based knowledge, they attack its most basic value. They try to bring the discussion down to their level, where their preferences for softer ""truths"" untethered to an unbending natural world can carry the day.

It’s an ironic argument, because the claim of the existence of an atheist metaphysics is itself based on an assumption that not only does empirical knowledge require faith, but it claims to explain everything. However, naturalism necessarily does exactly the opposite, leaving a potentially infinite space under the domain of the unknown. The very nature of our quest to expand our sphere of knowledge, the knowledge paradigm itself, forces us to accept and make peace with the unknown, for it will always be with us. You ignorantly try to turn this strength into a weakness, insisting because science doesn’t explain everything, it therefore explains nothing, trying to make a gap for your sky magicians to squirm into.",4,1485623299,2017-01-28 12:08:19

It was a common believe that if you left a pile of hay out long enough, it would spontaneously generate mice (because eventually you'd see mice coming out - but nobody ever saw them going in).  Similarly, it was a common believe that meat, left out for long enough, would spontaneously generate maggots.  [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation).

In science, a Theory is the **HIGHEST** level of certainty we have on a topic.  This is not a layman's theory, which is an educated guess at best, but a Scientific Theory.  Scientific Laws are like, say, Newton's Laws of Motion:  they'll describe something that happens, and even give you formulas to figure things out most of the time, but they have no *explanatory power*.  Scientific Theories, on the other hand, can tell you *why* something happens, in addition to being testable and having predictive power.  They're build upon evidence and repeated observation, tests, and survive the most rigorous peer review you'll ever see. I'll repeat myself here, because it bears repeating:  **scientific theories are the highest level of certainty we have for anything**.

No it does not. That you can't explain X does not entitle you to pick any other explanation. Personal incredulity is a fallacy, not evidence.

&gt; To me, evolution is an upstart idea created by false evidence and hoaxes at its inception. First came the theory, then many went to length to provide false information. 

Yes, to you. Not to anyone else that have the slightest knowledge in the field. The theory of evolution is not a claim, it's an explanation modell that explain the evidence we have gathered by observing the world around us. 
In science you form the theory based on the evidence, not the other way around. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory

&gt; For example, there was a textbook that had the embryology picture/drawing of different fetuses. Later it was ruled a hoax, yet it remained in public textbooks for decades. In fact, if I remember correctly, it was even in my biology textbook. So what's the idea here? 

Do you know who rejected Haeckel's Embryos? Other scientists. 
Haeckel wasn't entirely incorrect, but he filled out to many holes and interpreted and overestimated his findings to much. When other peers in the field reviewed his work they discovered this, therefore his work got rejected. Science is self correcting. That is something that we can't attribute to religion on the other hand. Religions ideas that is shown to be incorrect or that simply have no connection whatsoever to reality is still repeated over and over. 

People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. 

&gt; Simply put, anyone with biases, money and power, can push ANY agenda...ANY. People have this naive notion that if it's a public textbook then it's holy grail, untouchable.

171,"For example, human nature as is. History has been recorded as far as people could write. This means that if we evolved, we would have to see some kind of gradual increase in historical writings, something along the lines of tens of thousands of years ago. In order for things to fit, people would have to develop writing skills of recent human species so fast, that it's as if we we simply given that ability rather than gain it gradually over millions of years.

Another example. Many sources mention civilizations being able to field tens and hundreds of thousands of troops. This would mean, human population could often times be high. And as seen in history, human populations and civilizations expand/grow at an ever increasing rate, exponentially even. In other words, for MACRO evolution to be true, you'd have to have a steady population for hundreds of thousands of years, because based on current data, we would be at tens of trillions pop. by now if not more. Throughout history, humans were always building architecture and rome even had pipeworks, aqueducts, dams, roads, hospitals, etc. Ever since the beginning of man, there was always a pursuit of advance, tool buolding, etc. In order for evolution to be as is portrayed, you would need a transition period. You would need evidence of tools that gradually increased in sophistication AND be 10,000s years apart. When you read historical data, you can connect with those ancient peoples as if they were us but with lower grade tech. For example. We have cars and buses, they had chariots and carriages. We have bullets, they had arrows. We have engine powered tractors for farming. They had to use ox or horses. Human nature did not change over the millennia. Human greed, love, hate, intelligence, artistic ideas, etc. are all fundemental to human beings. It never changes....ever. Fashion simply goes in cycles of sorts. The reality is, people simply reinvent the wheel. Point is, if people from 4000-7000 years ago had same writing and thinking ability as us today, where is the transitional period? I mean, you would have to have a period of thinking that is primitive and set apart by thousands of years. You would have to have to show the steps humanity took in developing language and abstract thinking. But the reality is, the earliest history we have already bears sophisticate writing and thinking, ancient civilations who built hospitals, police networks, councils, roads, aqueducts, food production industries, organized society, poetry, medicine, art, etc. etc. So not only did our thinking not evolve past first recorded history, before recorded history, I don't know of ANYTHING that shows human thinking to be primitive. To me, historical data imply that we either instantly evolved our modern way of thinking(without gradual improvement) or that we were simply created as is. It implies we had our cilvilization mentality since the very beginning.

The problem today is that people talk about biology before talking about history. There is SOOO much history, so much things you can cross-reference, that many things simply don't add up. People have this mentality/notion that people were stupid, smaller, weaker, slower, stupid technology, and generally, were degenerates in comparison. Historical records demonstrate a shitton of sophistication in thinking, not seen anymore in modern day U.S. People simply don't know. They study math, biology, and some history about WW2 and maybe something about people using steel armor. I mean, just go outide right now and start asking questions about the crusades. I guarantee you, people will likely only be able to cite that it was about christians vs muslims, chain mail, crosses, arrows and something about a pope and jerusaelm. THAT""S IT. Everything I read from the many historical books I heard about, there are millions of files I haven't yet come across. There is simply SOOOOOO much knowledge about the world. About gem mining, farming, military tactics, politics, culture, philosophy, religion. I mean sooo much that even if you lived for thousands of years and reading every day all day, you'd never even get anywhere near gaining a tenth of the knowledge compiled, not counting the continuous compilation going on today. I mean, I bet no one today would even be able to fully complete read the full amount of legal texts just for the U.S. gov. and its states, not counting the rest of the world.

For me, simply showing me a few bones and claiming that they came from humans from 100,000-1,000,000 years ago simply doesn't add up. The whole notion of human evolution throughout the millions of years simply contradict the recorded human endeavors. 

Because the way it seems is-humans are monkeys(and don't bullshit me about apes. Apes came from monkey common ancestor, so basically a monkey), then those monkeys walk around nature, picking herbs and berries, hunting, living in shit huts, having no organized civilizations and then BAM, all of a sudden ancient-AF-civilizations with sophisticated AF thinking just randomly start popping all over the place. I mean, I expect there to be a transitional period which demonstrates gradual increase in thinking. But psychological fact is, the reason humans haven't evolved since earliest records is because in order for our modern sapiens thinking to be as is, we have to have everything at once. You cannot have language skills, if you aren't aware that you can organize sounds. You cannot write if you cannot understand symbols, that letters symbolize sounds and order them gramatically. You have to be self-conscious and be able to think beyond biological stimuli. This is simply from historical records perspective.

But the biggest evidence against evolution is-biological stimulus. Natural selection weeds out the unfit. All animals are fit, but humans are FAR beyond fit. It's like apotheosis from an animal's perspective. Realistically speaking, we don't need our abstract thinking for survival, we don't need to be self conscious to be fit. The reality is, there is no biological explanation that explains where and how humans needed our mentality to survive. Fact is, we don't need it. All animals survive just fine. In fact, cockroaches are one of the least evolved, yet thrives. Yet we still have it all. Why?

Well, the very simple fact people have hard time believing is that the world is a very simple place. Genius is in the simplicity. The simple fact is, we are spiritual beings who live in a mortal plane. Our thinking and innate knowledge of non biological matters has to come from somewhere. Morality cannot be produced by biology. It has no purpose. But plug in a non-evolutionary beginning/origins and everything falls into place and starts to make sense.

Many people simply are indoctrinated and place faith in authority to the point where people forget the simplest of logic.

For me, to look at only biology and not history is to look from a narrow perspective. How can one see the bigger picture, and thus the truth?",-3,1485592903,2017-01-28 03:41:43

247,"Cambrian Explosion: Remember, that term refers just to the *appearance of novel body plans in the fossil record*, not their appearance in the absolute sense. The more fossils we find, the longer this ""explosion"" becomes. It started at 5-10 million years, then expanded to 20-25, now it's a period of 40-50 million years, and many forms that we originally thought appeared during the Cambrian actually appeared much earlier (mollusks, for example).

That indicates that life prior to the Cambrian was more diverse than we thought 20, 30, 40 years ago. 

Additionally, we know from phylogenetic analysis that there was a fairly substantial increase in genetic diversity in the 50-100 million years leading up to the Cambrian Explosion. We also know that the climate was changing fairly rapidly during this time, becoming more diverse. One specific change was that there were more shallow oceans. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we have a bunch of things happening at once. Lots of genetic diversity. Lots of ecosystem diversity. That means lots of available ecological niches. In situations like that, rapid diversification is favored. We know this because we can observe it happening in the present. This situation, combined with an environment that was conducive to fossilization made two things happen simultaneously:

First, you genuinely had a bunch of new body plans appear. Not all at once, but within a 40-50 million year window. 

Second, you had fossilization of many types of organisms for the first time, some new, some not as new, but resulting in the relatively sudden appearance of a whole bunch of new forms in the fossil record (again, only some of these were actually novel at this time).

lol I know all about all of these hypothesis and they are pretty good scientific research but contrary to what you said they aren't widely accepted in the scientific community because the hypothesis try to connect fact with assumptions that are **impossible** and not to mention these hypothesis speak to one aspect of the process and ignore the various other problems that would occur and have no solution.

For instance, in the hypothesis you linked. The answer to the problem of Chirality was ""Self-replication appeared in molecules of one chirality first (randomly)"" if you had any idea about the formation of DNA you would know thats a **HUGE** assumptions and is laughable. Not to mention that Amino acid molecules that form proteins, and nucleotide molecules that form DNA and RNA resist combining at any temperature.  To combine, they need the help of mechanisms in a living cell or a biochemist in an organic chemistry laboratory.

Edit: I'm going to amend my answer. The eye is the single best piece of evidence for evolution. Or rather, ""eyes"" are the single best piece of evidence for evolution. The evolution of eyes illustrates the power of homology (things being similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor with that thing), analogy (things being functionally similar because two different groups of organisms have adapted under similar selective pressures), phylogenetics (you can look across all the types of eyes in animals and see the same genes underlying the structures and functions, even though they evolved separately), and morphology (we can find a wide range of eye complexity in nature, with each structure being similar to those slightly more or less complex, but the simplest and most complex being quite different from each other, while still operating on the same basic principles).

&gt; Let me take a direct quote from Darwin himself in his Origin of Species ""The number of intermediate varieties which have formerly existed on Earth must be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?



&gt;Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory""

The number of documented fossils in Darwin's time were maybe in the hundreds, now it's easily in the hundred thousands. So the amount of both the fossil record as well as any ""intermediate"" forms were pretty much nonexistent in his times. Darwin's interpretation on what constitutes ""enormous"" is up to our imagination too. And frankly, it's irrelevant. He could've been wrong for what it's worth. Darwin didn't even know all of the processes and details about fossilization like we do today.

Secondly, the term ""intermediate form"" is used less and less nowadays. Fossils are a snapshot of an organism at a given time and their classification into species does not match with the way in which we classify *living* organisms today. Every single fossil is an intermediate, strictly speaking.

Either way, the fossil record is pretty large nowadays. There are scientists who devote their whole life studying a sub sub sub group of fossils and they never finish, fossils take up thousands of museums. So yeah, What's the argument?



&gt; he also states that 4 major holes in his own theory:

Okay smartypants, let me hear what this man wrote in 1859.


&gt; The lack of transitional forms.

Already brought up, tell him to check up how many ""transitional forms"" existed in Darwin's lifetime. And as stated above, every fossil can be regarded as a transitional form.


&gt;The incredible complexity of such organs as the eye.

Imho an impossible task for Darwin to solve. Without any knowledge in molecular biology? No chance. [Here's how the story looks like 160 years later though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye)


&gt; The development of instincts in animals.

Instincts are traits, just like any other trait. Behavioral traits are pretty difficult to quantify and therefore harder to understand in an evolutionary context than lets say, a trait like eye color. This is a pretty broad stroke though, we do understand some behavioral traits, some we don't. What is the point to list this issue Darwin had with this?


&gt; The sterility of crossbreeding in animals.

Sterility is beneficial for a population in order to maintain at least a slight genetical isolation. Also, as far as I remember, Darwin didn't have the slightest idea how things worked in a microevolutionary context. He was able to paint broad strokes, but was he able to understand this on a scale of population genetics? No way, that's why he also wasn't able to simply describe the process of speciation like today, were every biology student already has the knowledge.





&gt; ...That was in 1859.

Wow good observation.


&gt;Almost 160 years later and Atheists still cant give no concrete answers

That's strange, so you want to tell me that literally 100% of your entire argument is based on quoting from a 160 year old book and now you want to tell me about how you know so much about how things look like today?

Where are your arguments?


Also, on a side note, why the hell does he say ""Atheists""? The Theory of Evolution is accepted by most people in the first world (Sadly with an exception in the US) So technically, the majority of people who accept the ToE are catholics and muslims, probably followed by most big religions until we come to Atheists. Atheists are pretty much a minority in most countries, sometimes they aren't even represented in statistics.


&gt; as well as a huge amount of other holes in evolution that have arisen due to modern science and many scientific discoveries.

Where's the argument? No sources, no real argument, just 160 year old quotes. pretty pathetic and simple to refute.

The rise of molecular biology and genetics has completely **cemented** the Theory of Evolution. There's as much doubt about the ToE as there is about the sun rising every morning and the earth turning around it's axis every day.


I'd like to [quote a fellow colleague](https://np.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/5f085t/is_their_really_mountains_of_evidence_for/daggh05/?context=3) over at /r/biology to close this one off. Quote below, I'm out:



_____

The fossil record is actually the *least* important evidence for evolution.

There is so much evidence for evolution that dozens of popular books have been published to summarize it (you can find many of these books listed in the sidebar to the right).  And then, almost every scientific paper ever published in the fields of ecology, physiology, anatomy, zoology, botany, microbiology, and every other branch of biology can stand as evidence for evolutionary theory.  

When people first began thinking of the idea of evolution (at least all the way back to the ancient Greek philosophers, hundreds of years before Christ) the things that led them to those thoughts were the similarities between organisms.  When these similarities are due to shared ancestry (one of the major tenets of evolutionary theory), we call them homology.  If the bone structure in your arm is the same as the bone structure in a whale, a seal, your dog, or a bat (and it is), the reason is that all of those animals shared a common ancestor that had that bone structure.  Homology due to evolutionary relationships explains so many oddities of animal anatomy.  It explains why your air hole and your food hole lead to the same place.  It explains why you had a tail during embryological development.  It explains why your testes develop up inside your abdomen and then move do their ""normal"" place inside the scrotum.  

Nowadays, we use molecular homology to do an even better job of figuring out evolutionary relationships.  You're probably familiar with tv programs like the Maury Povich show, where DNA is used to demonstrate which baby is descended from which parent.  The DNA from parent and child is compared, and if there is significant similarity, it proves paternity pretty much beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Scientists do the same thing with DNA from different species.  Depending upon how you count the differences, the DNA of you and a chimp is over 97% identical.  There is no other explanation for that except that you shared a common ancestor, around 6 million years ago.  Every time you open up a journal, a new paper is demonstrating relationships within and between families of organisms.  It's how we know, for example, that whales are descended from hippo-like ancestors.  So much work has been done in this area, and the conclusions are so strong, that for this line of evidence to be wrong, everything we know about genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry would also have to be wrong. 

When Darwin began thinking about natural selection, the line of evidence that may have been most important to him was the pattern of distribution of plants and animals across the world--what we now call the science of biogeography.  His observations of the placement of various species of birds, reptiles, and other organisms only made sense if you assume that organisms have a center of origin, and then gradually move and change from that point.  

All of these lines of evidence (and some others) were in place before much of the fossil record had been uncovered.  What the discovery of fossils did was mostly to *confirm* evolutionary theory that was already in place.  Of course some fossils were uncovered previous to the work of Darwin and others, but I like to think of the construction of biological classification (begun with Linnaeus in the mid-1700s) as a grand natural experiment that was confirmed by the birth of the science of paleontology.  The evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane famously said that evolution could easily be falsified by someone who dug up rabbits in Precambrian rocks (the oldest fossil-bearing rocks).  What he was saying was that the fossil record acts as a check on evolutionary theory.  We can make predictions about what kind of rocks should have what kind of fossil, based on what we know about when and where certain organisms evolved.  And when we go to those rocks and look, they do a great job of bearing out those predictions.  (Read the story of *Tiktaalik* to see an excellent example of how this works.)

TLDR:  The fossil record does consist of millions of bits of evidence for evolution, but is not the most important or convincing line of evolutionary evidence.

327,"Fossilization is not the norm, it's the exception. Most creatures rot and are recycled into the ecosystem.

As a result, the fossils we find tend to have been fossilized under uncommon circumstances -- volcanic eruptions, floods, etc. These are not common events.

Thus, the fossil record tends to occur in snapshots, not in a continuous gradient.",7,1485551004,2017-01-27 16:03:24
328,"a. Fossilization is a rare process that requires a number of circumstantial occurrences. The fact that the fossils we *do* have line up so well with common descent is icing on the cake. Darwin likely did not know of the process of fossilization, and creationists aren't the type to actually take that into account. It helps their narrative if they assume fossilization is common, because that assumes there haven't been that many living organisms.

b. Transitional forms such as tiktaalik? Or what about the dozens of forms documented in the evolutionary history of dolphins?

c. The eye exists in a number of stages in nature, ranging from pinhole camera-type eyes to the brilliant degree of complexity in an owl's eye. The fact that the variety of eyes all correspond to evolutionary ""pathways"" and can be observed as different stages in a continuous pattern of descent with modification is very compelling if one considers the broader picture.

d. Instincts can develop as easily as any other physical traits. Anyone who doesn't already defer some kind of mystical element to the mind can easily see the plasticity of the brain and how it affects an organism's behavior, either developmentally or genetically.

e. Animals crossbreeding is largely a problem due to the nature of chromosomes between two species. Crossbreeding is only responsible for a minute amount of genetic variation among species, and only among members of species so closely related that they may as well be ring species. The vast majority in multicellular life forms comes from genetically distinct populations breeding among their own populations to produce variable traits.",2,1485550920,2017-01-27 16:02:00

There exists absolutely no evidence pointing towards anything even remotely resembling the Abrahamic creation mythology - but there is quite a bit of evidence that contradicts it.  The evolutionary origins of mankind are very well understoid, and **there is no missing link**.

The geological column, similarly, shows no evidence of any global flood.  Genetic analysis shows mankind's migration out of Africa, including different waves leaving at different times in different directions, and this evidence lines up with geological evidence including continental drift and subsidence (there once was a land-bridge between Asia and North America, for example, and it was used for migration by humans and other animals).

As for a historical Jesus, there's surprisingly little evidence that such a character even existed.  Speculation on the origins of his Y chromosome are rather meaningless in the face of that.  As for ""miracles"", I would say that it's quite telling that the frequency of miracles seems to decline as the education level of societies improves.

Both events you describe are talked about to us by others. The only difference is that a human telling us things has certain limitations that aren't present when a girasas tries to tell us things. Does a girasas even speak?  Mostly we are listening to half human-half girasas, but The Secret Doctrine tells us that humans didn't even speak until their third race, after the evolving animal had partly ascended. 

If you are going to try to rely on things that ascended beings tells us, maybe having more information would help you to rely on the meaning. Rely on both those things:

338,"One other thing. I encountered another Muslim using [this same page as you](http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=37310) as evidence a couple days ago.

The argument found on that page, in addition to being completely disprovable with a basic understanding of genetics, is based on an extremely bad misunderstanding of what the science says.

So it's not only a bad argument, it's arguing against an idea that no one has ever proposed.

Here's what I replied to him:

&gt; &gt; Neither the Sharee‘ah nor experience accepts the saying that the skin color of some people has became black due to the heat of the sun.

&gt; I've never heard anyone claim this, but I think you may be describing an extremely misunderstood version of the theory that human skin tones evolved to match the amount of UV radiation that their population received.

&gt; UV is a double edged sword. Long term it causes cancers, which kill individuals. Having more melanin in the skin protects you from the harmful effects of UV, but it also blocks the good effects. Our bodies use UV to produce vitamin D, so blocking too much of it can cause all sorts of problems associated with vitamin D deficiency.

&gt; Because of this, over many generations human skin color has evolved to find the best balance between protection from UV and allowing it's beneficial effects. This balance obviously changes from region to region, with higher UV ranges favoring darker skin and lower UV favoring lighter skin.

&gt; And this is exactly what we find when we check the data. [Places that receive more UV](https://solarcoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SolarGIS-Solar-map-World-map-en.png) are [populated by people with darker skin.](https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/59/61759-004-9A507F1C.jpg)

&gt; So you're right that taking a white person and dropping them in africa isn't going to give them as dark of skin as a black person. But if you have a population then the lightest individuals living in a place with high solar radiation will experience selective pressures against them. This will cause them to have, on average, fewer children than those with darker skin living in the same conditions which, over many generations, will darken the population's average skin tone.

&gt; (This is assuming natural conditions of course. In the modern world where people can take D vitamins in pill form or use sun screen the level of solar radiation is not nearly as strong a selective pressure as it once was)",3,1485537516,2017-01-27 12:18:36
339,"No. Not even a little bit.

This is a gross oversimplification of course but (and I mean no offence by this) your understanding of biology seems to be very weak so we'll try thinking about it like this:

Each of the chromosomes in your body has a slot for each gene, this is called a loci. Only one gene can go in each loci. Humans have 2 sets of chromosomes, so each human can only have 2 versions of any particular gene.

If you read the article I linked to above, it mentions many types of genetic variation. One of the most common of which is single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. It states that there are between 10 million and 30 million SNPs in humans.

It's simply not possible for one genome to contain that much variation.",5,1485536302,2017-01-27 11:58:22
340,"I can offer my thinking on this subject, but first you might be interested to know that most of the material I have studied comes from literature written in the last 150 years. I have actually read two authors who have had the experience, according to their books of channeling Yahweh, and this happened to them in the 1990s. Before finding the authors writing down Yahweh, I had read numerous individuals' accounts of channeling Ascended Masters: Hilarion, Kuthumi, Morya, St. Germain, Jesus, and many many others. Archangel Michael has also written through individuals, so the list extends from God, to ascended masters, and even includes angels and diverse kinds of cosmic beings. I am familiar with this literature. 

In 1995 I had an epiphany that caused me to rethink everything I had learned and read and also to begin telling others about a new theory of evolution. The Secret Doctrine by Blavatsky (1888) answers those questions you raise like this:  There are seven Adams, one for each race. They are the starting point for each of the 7 races. Now you might want to alter your definition of what is human and what isn't because the first 3 races are in combination with evolving animals. Those evolving animals were dinosaurs on earth and they were ascended off earth due to the human descent into their bodies in 3 stages: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd human races were simultaneous with the 5th, 6th, and 7th animal races. Animals we see on earth today are not evolving, but show form changes due to two groups of angels, which are involving, changing places on earth, which began when our current human 5th race began. Our angels replaced evolving animal angels and now girasas angels are replacing our angels. A higher kingdom, which I named girasas, is descending into the human over millions of years, just as humans descended into evolving animals. With them they bring their environments - a group of angels - and when every evolving kingdom leaves, including animal and human, their environment of angels leaves with them. 

Since, all people on earth are a 5th race, we began with Adam, which was buried in the ground and saved for us as a starting point (and all seven Adams are preserved as starting points) from the last time we evolved on earth when it and we were predominantly made of water. Each kingdom visits earth 7 times and this is our 4th round on earth. The previous times, our main element changed from fire, air, water, earth, and there are three more we are unfamiliar with. 

Adam is saved after our evolution and when we return, these shistas are brought forth - remember Adam was used in water and re adapted to earthy existence. Our evolutionary progress is preserved each time we leave earth. 

Now for the virgin birth. In general, if we humans have a higher kingdom inside of us (The kingdom of God is within you.), then our creation story in Genesis refers more to the beginning of the girasas kingdom living on earth with their angels and in us. The creation is their creation. 

Jesus Christ is an example of a 6th race human being, but the shista or buried Adam has not been retrieved for the use of a 6th race yet, which will not begin for another 400,000 years. So both Mary and Jesus and all ascended master have 6th race human consciousness, but there are no earthly bodies for them to use yet and they will serve in an ascended state until the 6th race begins. 

We just need to expand our definitions, rethinking what we mean by human; is it all seven races?  Rethinking what we mean by evolution; our senses observe changes in form, but inside could be two involving kingdoms changing places, and rethinking what a higher kingdom: girasas would live like inside of us. Using psychology's breakdown of the id, superego, and ego may help us to consider the girasas and their angel (id) alongside of the human or ego, and all three using the same body.

He didn't say that *beliefs* require evidence. Beliefs are what we have *despite* the evidence.  He said, ""For something to be *true* you need evidence.""  What we *believe* and what is *true* many times are very different things.

&gt;It seems more likely to me that humans are sort of pre-programmed with certain default beliefs, like trusting our senses, and we don't really need proof for those default beliefs.

This is an example of a claim that requires a good amount of evidence before we can determine it's truth.  Otherwise, unless you study Neuroscience, you must admit that you are simply ill-equipped to consider your own layman's *opinion* a valid one on this topic - *regardless* of what you *believe* ""seems more likely.""

351,"&gt;Neither the Sharee‘ah nor experience accepts the saying that the skin color of some people has became black due to the heat of the sun. Any wise person obviously knows that. It is a fact that climate and heat affect skin color, but they do not affect the genes because when a black man moves to a cold region, the black color of his skin does not change. Also, when a white man moves to a hot region, his skin color becomes darker and when he returns to a cold region, his skin becomes whiter again.

That is not how evolution works. Evolution happens in population over multiple generation, not to individuals. If a dark skinned group of people move to a less sunny latitude their skin colour will become lighter over time because those individuals with lighter skin are able to absorb more sunlight to make vitamin D and thus have a survival advantage.

It's a shame for the DI not to be here where the action's at during the rebirth of paleontology that searches for features of living things when alive, more specifically called ""ichnology"" but that only makes people think of fish biology, not a features of geology are best explained by intelligent cause thing.

All of this is very relevant to the ID debate. In our case though it's science that would exist even where the DI didn't. It's made of mundane looking science papers and scholarly Wikipedia articles. Through me into forums like this one lives the spirit of local legend Reverend Dr. Edward Hitchcock, which is of course my project not theirs. With my having grown up one of the biggest United Methodist ""church rat"" in the neighborhood and theory that helps its leaders explain why Bishop Coyner and others were right about the DI not speaking for their religion it adds this to the fun so why not?

370,"&gt; I mean, ithe creation of adam was a miracle as shown here: about this by way of direct revelation The direct creation of Adam (can neither be confirmed nor denied by science in any way. This is because the creation of Adam was a unique and singular historical event. It is a matter of the Unseen and something that science does not have the power to confirm or deny. 

Yes it can, we are apes. Our species came from a species that gave rise to humans and the other ape species. There have been several different species of humans, but ours is the one that survived. We have the fossil and the DNA evidence to prove it. At no point in history has there ever only been a single human that exists, the only time there will be a single human in existence is when we do extinct, before the last person dies.",2,1485499627,2017-01-27 01:47:07
371,"&gt; As well, how does genetics disprove that exactly?

The only way for humans to descend from one person with this much genetic diversity would be if each sperm cell had different sets of chromosomes, and each egg his sperm fertilized would have to have different sets of chromosomes to avoid repeats. And each time him and the women he impregnates had children the chromosomes used would have to magically be deleted out of the man and women. That isn't how biology works though. Even if there was one person who had racial traits from every race on earth, his offspring would be born pure black and pure white and pure asian, they would all be interracial because of how the body arranges chromosomes when making sperm. Also Adam would have to have been part Neanderthal, because some people today have Neanderthal DNA. ",3,1485499383,2017-01-27 01:43:03

It is important to note that Y-chromosome Adam was not the only one alive at the time. It just represents the last common ancestor for the Y chromosome. Not even the last common ancestor for all males, or all chromosomes. **JUST** the Y chromosome.

I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not sure if you've thought through the philosophical implications of that claim. Do you have evidence that your senses are reliable? Do you have evidence you aren't living in the Matrix? Do you have evidence *for the belief itself* that all beliefs require evidence?

It seems more likely to me that humans are sort of pre-programmed with certain default beliefs, like trusting our senses, and we don't really need proof for those default beliefs. Granted, a virgin birth is NOT one of those default beliefs, haha. But it is really important philosophically for us to realize we can't have proof for EVERYthing.

It was narrated on the authority of Abu Moosa  may  Allaah  be  pleased  with  him that the Prophet , said: ""Allaah The Exalted created Aadam (Adam  may  Allaah  exalt  his  mention), from a handful that grasped all parts of the earth. Hence, the Children of Aadam have varied (in appearance and traits) according to the nature of the earth. There came from them the white, red, black and (others with colors) in between, and (there also came from them) the wicked, kind, lenient, harsh, and (others with characteristics) in between.""

This Hadeeth shows that differences in the color of people's skin varies according to the differences in color of the earth from which Aadam  may  Allaah  exalt  his  mention was created.
Neither the Sharee‘ah nor experience accepts the saying that the skin color of some people has became black due to the heat of the sun. Any wise person obviously knows that. It is a fact that climate and heat affect skin color, but they do not affect the genes because when a black man moves to a cold region, the black color of his skin does not change. Also, when a white man moves to a hot region, his skin color becomes darker and when he returns to a cold region, his skin becomes whiter again.",1,1485484847,2017-01-26 21:40:47

Scientific evidence allows us to look at the first story and confirm/disconfirm it. The effects are literally universal, so we should be able to find relevant evidence everywhere. And that observed evidence will either be consistent with the narrative, or inconsistent with it.

Scientific evidence *doesn't* really allow us to investigate the origin of one dude 2,000 years ago, because it's too specific and too distant. The most science could say would be, ""that's a miracle, and miracles never happen""...but then that's actually a philosophical objection (albeit one highly influenced by empirical observations).

*Just because something can not be proven wrong, that alone does not mean it is sensible or even justifiable to believe in it.* 
There are (almost) literally endless things I can name that can't be ""confirmed nor denied by science in any way"", yet even you would agree that it makes no sense to believe in them.
Science can't disprove that invisible, magical faeries exist everywhere around us, that a purple walrus lives at the center of the planet Jupiter, or that the entire universe was created six minutes ago, but with all our fake memories and fake evidence in place that suggests an older universe.

something because it *can* be proven that it *did* happen. 

All of that being said: Yes, science **CAN** disprove that God created Adam, at least if you are talking about any abrahamic Version of the Adam-and-Eve-Myth. Because they all have in common, that adam and eve were the progenitor for the human race. This we can disprove, we have tons of evidence that the first humans gradually evolved from other apes. This is mutually exclusive with that myth. Sure, you can technically say that it can't be disproven that God popped some guy spontaneously into existence, who then had descendants that are still alive today. But if he did, he popped him into a world in which humans had already evolved naturally, and he just made another one just like them, which seems kind of odd, but sure, technically not disproven.

That doesn't fit the data we have on the subject at all. We can actually check the DNA of indigenous populations at further and further distances from the equator and see exactly what mutations occurred as their ancestors migrated.

All populations lead back to africa, and groups today that have light skin, such as European and East Asian populations, actually accumulated different mutations to their genes that achieve the same end function of lightening skin.

&gt; Neither the Sharee‘ah nor experience accepts the saying that the skin color of some people has became black due to the heat of the sun.

I've never heard anyone claim this, but I think you may be describing an extremely misunderstood version of the theory that human skin tones evolved to match the amount of UV radiation that their population received.

UV is a double edged sword. Long term it causes cancers, which kill individuals. Having more melanin in the skin protects you from the harmful effects of UV, but it also blocks the good effects. Our bodies use UV to produce vitamin D, so blocking too much of it can cause all sorts of problems associated with vitamin D deficiency.

Because of this, over many generations human skin color has evolved to find the best balance between protection from UV and allowing it's beneficial effects. This balance obviously changes from region to region, with higher UV ranges favoring darker skin and lower UV favoring lighter skin.

And this is exactly what we find when we check the data. [Places that receive more UV](https://solarcoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SolarGIS-Solar-map-World-map-en.png) are [populated by people with darker skin.](https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/59/61759-004-9A507F1C.jpg)

So you're right that taking a white person and dropping them in africa isn't going to give them as dark of skin as a black person. But if you have a population then the lightest individuals living in a place with high solar radiation will experience selective pressures against them. This will cause them to have, on average, fewer children than those with darker skin living in the same conditions which, over many generations, will darken the population's average skin tone.

(This is assuming natural conditions of course. In the modern world where people can take D vitamins in pill form or use sun screen the level of solar radiation is not nearly as strong a selective pressure as it once was)",6,1485452447,2017-01-26 12:40:47

Neither the Sharee‘ah nor experience accepts the saying that the skin color of some people has became black due to the heat of the sun. Any wise person obviously knows that. It is a fact that climate and heat affect skin color, but they do not affect the genes because when a black man moves to a cold region, the black color of his skin does not change.

Lee Strobel, A case for a creator page 139,  :

""One reason some scientists are reluctant,"" I said, ""is because they claim intelligent design is not falsifiable."" I was referring to the belief among many philosophers and scientists that atheory cannot truly be scientific unless there are potential ways to prove it false through experiments or other means.
""That's silly,"" Behe replied.
""But I hear it over and over,"" I insisted. ""The National Academy of Sciences said: `Intelligent design ... [is] not science because [it's] not testable by the methods of science.""'
""Yes, I know,"" he said, ""but what's really ironic is that intelligent design is routinely called unfalsifiable by the very people who are busy trying to falsify it! As you just pointed out, Miller proposed a test that would falsify the claim that intelligence is needed to produce an irreducibly complex system. So I don't see the problem. Intelligent design's strong point is that it's falsifiable, just like a good scientific theory should be. Frankly, I'd say it's more falsifiable than Darwinism is.""
""Come on,"" I said. ""Do you really believe that?""
""Yes, I do, and I'll give you an example,"" he replied. ""My claim is that there is no unintelligent process that could produce the bacterial flagellum. To falsify that claim, all you would have to do would be to find one unintelligent process that could produce that system. On the other hand, Darwinists claim that some unintelligent process could produce the flagellum. To falsify that, you'd have to show that the system could not possibly have been created by any of a potentially infinite number of possible unintelligent processes. That's impossible to do. So which claim is falsifiable? I'd say the claim for intelligent design.""
That isn't the only objection that Behe has turned on its head. While Darwinists often accuse intelligent design proponents of letting their religious beliefs color their science, Behe once told a newspaper reporter: ""It has been my experience ... that the ones who oppose the theory of design most vociferously do so for religious reasons.""""8
""What did you mean by that?"" I asked.
""It seems that the folks who get the most animated when talking about Darwinian evolution are the ones most concerned with the philosophical and theological ramifications of the theory, not the science itself,"" he explained.
""Scientists propose hypotheses all the time. No big deal. But if I say, `I don't think natural selection is the driving force for the development of life; I think it was intelligent design,' people don't just disagree; many of them jump up and down and get red in the face. When you talk to them about it, invariably they're not excited because they disagree with the science; it's because they see the extra-scientific implications of intelligent design and they don't like where it's leading.""
Behe shrugged. ""I guess that's okay,"" he added. ""These are important issues and people can get emotional about them. But we should not use what we want to be true to dismiss arguments or try to avoid them.""

Kitzmiller Transcript of Testimony of Scott Minnich pgs. 99-108, Nov. 3, 2005, emphasis added

We have a mutation in a drive shaft protein or the U joint, and they can't swim. Now, to confirm that that's the only part that we've affected, you know, is that we can identify this mutation, clone the gene from the wild type and reintroduce it by mechanism of genetic complementation. So this is, these cells up here are derived from this mutant where we have complemented with a good copy of the gene. One mutation, one part knock out, it can't swim. Put that single gene back in we restore motility. Same thing over here. We put, knock out one part, put a good copy of the gene back in, and they can swim. By definition the system is irreducibly complex. We've done that with all 35 components of the flagellum, and we get the same effect.

That means, evolution was not a driving force and acting for the emergence and origin of the first living organisms.

First things first: you've either misunderstood or misrepresented the Furusawa &amp; Doi paper. Nowhere in the paper do they comment in the slightest on whether or not some form of evolution would be possible without DNA. The sentence you quoted and the paper itself is about the dichotomy of the roles of DNA and the way it is replicated: on the one hand there needs to be no errors for heredity, on the other hand there needs to be some errors to give variation. There's a big difference between 'inheritance and variation comes from DNA' and 'inheritance and variation can come only from DNA'.

Secondly: the published word is not sacred in science, it can and should be questioned. Let's imagine a hypothetical paper published by Stephen Gould in Nature that stated that 'inheritence and variation can come only from DNA'. Merely highlighting this paper and picking out a choice quote or two would in absolutely no way mean that you've demonstrated the truth of it. What you need are the arguments and evidence from the paper, not quotes.

8,"Yeah like, in a good class on Modernist philosophy you'll go through the classical string of Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, and Hume to show how the philosophy of the era was defined by reductionism, which would be integral in the emerging scientific method (and also why a lot of the pseudophilosophy like ""presuppositional apologetics"" spouted by Creationists is a step backward).

It's just that these philosophers took their reductionism too far.  While they generated interesting thought exercises (such as Berkeley's claim that there's no such thing as matter) and Descartes' Meditations, at some point their arguments broke down into a certain level of absurdity.  It took Kant to bring it back to reality and shaped philosophy in the centuries to come.  He was instrumental in pointing out that while these philosophers' reasoning was technically sound within a certain context, they were ultimately meaningless when you consider knowledge as an inescapably human activity that is both bounded by and defined by the human mind organizing concepts in specified ways.

Circling back, this is ultimately the problem with the treatise linked in the OP.  The author starts off with an underlying assumption:  that knowledge must be ""certain,"" and then rolls off a long list of philosophers without considering that half of them don't necessarily agree.

13,"Ah, ""scientism"" the favorite strawman of the creationist who want to try to bring the knowledge paradigm down to their level.  This faith in science construction is one of the most pernicious and enduring forms of theistic equivocation. Let’s review: It’s self-evident that when I do a physics lab assignment and test out Newton’s laws, I don’t have to have faith. I make observations which either correspond with the laws or they don’t. If I’m unsure, I can ask someone else to observe with me. If we both find a discrepancy, either I made a mistake in my procedure, or I’ve discovered a new property of matter.

For a theist to claim that lab work requires faith is clear equivocation. At the risk of being highly tedious and pedantic, let me just reiterate what I mean: Faith in careful procedures and collection of evidence is not the same as your unevidenced faith in the supernatural.  This sort of equivocation comes up all the time, though. It’s part of the immune system of the theistic memeplex.  I posit that this equivocation comes from a deep-seated knowledge that their beliefs are not supportable. The emperor really isn’t wearing clothes, and they know it at some level.  They learned something they couldn't refute, and so they had a choice: they could remain honest, or they could remain creationist, but they could no longer be both.  The part of their brain which normally would question such belief on insufficient evidence has been shunted permanently into bypass mode.   It's readily apparent that this is the case, too: while they accept their mythology without any overt questions, tell them the paint is wet and they'll still touch it to check!  No one wants to feel deficient, so they play up the virtues of this ""cognitive bypass"" and call it ""faith."" They’ve traded truth for comfort as a survival strategy which allows them to maintain the requisite levels of cognitive dissonance.

But they can’t completely shut down their critical thinking, which gives them a permanent inferiority complex, albeit at an unconscious level.  Though they may have outer comfort, they still feel the sands shifting beneath their feet, because they know they can’t be sure they’ve chosen the ""right"" belief system out of the countless thousands possible. The more time they have devoted to the system they chose, the more the bypassed critical thinking skills will have atrophied, and the more likely they are to defend their faith to the death. Knowing they suffer from this insurmountable uncertainty, they simply must attempt to level the playing field. (To do so, many have devoted lifetimes or built entire libraries of theological texts based on their presuppositionalism – essentially intellectual castles in the sky.)

Rather than take the difficult and painstaking steps of learning to live within the confines of evidence-based knowledge, they attack its most basic value. They try to bring the discussion down to their level, where their preferences for softer ""truths"" untethered to an unbending natural world can carry the day.

It’s an ironic argument, because the claim of the existence of an atheist metaphysics is itself based on an assumption that not only does empirical knowledge require faith, but it claims to explain everything. However, naturalism necessarily does exactly the opposite, leaving a potentially infinite space under the domain of the unknown. The very nature of our quest to expand our sphere of knowledge, the knowledge paradigm itself, forces us to accept and make peace with the unknown, for it will always be with us. You ignorantly try to turn this strength into a weakness, insisting because science doesn’t explain everything, it therefore explains nothing, trying to make a gap for your sky magicians to squirm into.",2,1480366535,2016-11-28 15:55:35

For the rest, we rely on selection from that population of states within an environment, and that's where imperfect replication creates variation that can be acted upon.

Let's examine a random pebble for a moment.  If we sequence the atoms in it, what is the probability that any given atom would randomly occur in the place that it does in that pebble?  Given the size of any given pebble, roughly one in 10^26 or more; that this atom was placed there is so improbable, given 1 million random chances to place it per second, it would take you on average 3 TRILLION years to place it correctly.  So, what does this mean, that pebbles are too improbable, and therefore, god?  No.  What we're discussing is a field of chemistry called Statistical Thermodynamics.  Any given configuration of matter is equally and infinitely improbable, but ultimately, the system must exist in one state or another.  The population of states explored by the system of a pebble, just as with a genetic system, is explored not by chance, but by a force or forces.  In the case of genetics, it's the electromagnetic force.  For the pebble, it's that and gravitation (various geological processes distilled).

Another underlying problem with this paper is the emphasis on certainty as a prerequisite for knowledge.  While it certainly was a popular metric for pre-Kantian philosophers (who were growing out of the theology-driven Medieval era of philosophy), post-Kantian philosophers generally aren't that concerned about knowledge being ""certain"" and instead focus on knowledge as an encapsulated system of consistency, verified observation, and clear meaning.

Despite the conceptual elegance of the RNA world, the hypothesis faces problems, primarily due to the immense challenge of synthesizing RNA nucleotides under plausible prebiotic conditions and the susceptibility of RNA oligomers to degradation via hydrolysis 21 Due to the organizational structure of systems capable of processing algorithmic (instructional) information, it is not at all clear that a monomolecular system – where a single polymer plays the role of catalyst and informational carrier – is even logically consistent with the organization of information flow in living systems, because there is no possibility of separating information storage from information processing (that being such a distinctive feature of modern life). As such, digital–first systems (as currently posed) represent a rather trivial form of information processing that fails to capture the logical structure of life as we know it. 

We need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects of life, or the job is only half finished. Explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a solution to life’s origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside a computer. It is this transition where one should expect to see a chemical system literally take-on “a life of its own”, characterized by informational dynamics which become decoupled from the dictates of local chemistry alone (while of course remaining fully consistent with those dictates). Thus the famed chicken-or-egg problem (a solely hardware issue) is not the true sticking point. Rather, the puzzle lies with something fundamentally different, a problem of causal organization having to do with the separation of informational and mechanical aspects into parallel causal narratives. The real challenge of life’s origin is thus to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics.",1,1480356425,2016-11-28 13:07:05

Fine tuning is a scientific term which applies to physical modeling. It describes a situation where one or more parameters of the model must be very precise when the model itself does not offer mechanisms to constrain their values. So-called ""fine tuning problems"" are not problems in that they cannot be solved naturally, but because they indicate that the given model is incomplete. The existence of fine tuning in physical models does not in any way indicate that the universe itself has been ""finely tuned"". To even use the term ""fine tuning"" when discussing the universe itself, as opposed to discussing scientific theories of cosmologies and physics, is an example of frequently used creationist dishonesty. It is the intentional misapplication, out of context, of a phrase that introduces anthropic bias.

A much better term for actually discussing nature would be ""precision"", but bear in mind that every parameter that must be ""finely tuned"" in models (for example, the cosmological constant or the strength of gravity) is merely a number which our particular models require in order to highlight something that appears to remain constant. Without the models that these constants are tuned for, these numbers would have no physical meaning, and we don't know if they are arbitrary or necessary, or whether they are really separate things at all. They may very well be unified by an underlying structure which we cannot yet describe. The fact that they were arrived at in different fields by different people at different points in history makes it more challenging to achieve unification because there are disconnects between many of the major theories of modern physics. This is not to say that these theories are inaccurate, and many of them are remarkably powerful within their domains of applicability, but they each explore a limited scale of nature and do not always join up neatly.

To tackle things in a more direct way, there's about 75 cubic kilometers of life on earth, while the volume of the earth is about a trillion cubic kilometers. That means that by volume, the earth is about 1 one-billionth of one percent life. This is analogous to saying that a rock approximately the same size as a car with a fleck of iron in it the size of a pinhead is finely tuned for the purposes of human transport, as a car is. It gets better, though, when creationists argue that we are the only life in our galaxy. The volume of the space between our galaxy and the nearest one is about 5 * 10^58 cubic kilometers. This means that, for creationists, if you find something that is one part in 10^58 that works, then that object is finely tuned for that purpose. This is like taking a billion earth sized planets, finding a single iron atom on one of them, and then concluding that these billion planets are finely tuned for a purpose.

High-energy phosphate compounds. Phosphate groups assume an integral role in the linkages that form the backbone of DNA and RNA. They also comprise the head-group region of key cell membrane components (phospholipids). In addition to their structural importance, phosphates also serve a critical role in the cell’s metabolic processes. Phosphate chains, called polyphosphates, form a relatively unstable high-energy chemical structure in which the cell’s metabolic systems store energy. The breakage of these highenergy phosphate bonds releases energy used by the cell to power its operation. All organisms continuously produce and consume massive amounts of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and similar compounds in which polyphosphate groups are constituents. Many researchers speculate that more primitive prebiotic polyphosphate compounds played a similar role to ATP during the origin-of-life process and later evolved into ATP. Because high-energy compounds that could transfer phosphate groups to the RNA and DNA backbones were essential to the RNA- and DNA-protein-world scenarios, a phosphate source must have been present on early Earth. Researchers propose several possible prebiotic chemical routes to polyphosphates. The most common include  the heating of apatite (a phosphate-containing mineral);  the high-temperature heating (from 392 to 1,112 °F, 200 to 600 °C) of dihydrogen phosphates; and  the phosphates’ reaction with high-energy organic compounds.
Although several plausible routes to polyphosphates exist, researchers wonder if these chemical pathways have any relevance to early Earth. For example, to produce polyphosphates from apatite and dihydrogen phosphate, water must be completely driven from the system—an impossibility for phosphate minerals confined to rocks. Furthermore, the high temperatures needed to form polyphosphates would in turn destroy any organic material. The suggested production of polyphosphates from high-energy chemicals (allegedly formed in spark-discharge reactions on early Earth) lacks chemical robustness. These reactions require unrealistically high levels of starting materials and produce low yields. Laboratory spark-discharge experiments performed under a wide range of chemical conditions failed to yield polyphosphates when phosphates were included in the reaction vessel. Even if a means existed on primordial Earth to form polyphosphates, their availability for prebiotic reactions is unlikely because calcium ions drive polyphosphates to precipitate out of solutions. These ions would have been everywhere on early Earth. Given the extreme rarity (or nonexistence) of polyphosphate minerals on Earth today, the conclusion that prebiotic polyphosphate synthesis could not have taken place on early Earth seems justifiable. Studies on possible prebiotic production of cytosine, ribose, and polyphosphates demonstrate that even though researchers have identified chemical pathways to them, the lack of available starting materials, plus chemical interference by other environmental materials and rapid decomposition, would have precluded formation. In other words, viable chemical routes to these key life molecules have not been found.
The origin-of-life community widely acknowledges the prebiotic production of ribose, cytosine, and polyphosphates as painfully problematic. In fact, at the opening plenary lecture of ISSOL 2002, after summarizing these and other problems, distinguished origin-of-life researcher Leslie Orgel stated, “It would be a miracle if a strand of RNA ever appeared on the primitive Earth.”20 As a preface to this conclusion, Orgel remarked that he “hoped no creationists [were] in the audience.” Laughter erupted throughout the room. Orgel did not advocate a supernatural explanation for life’s origin. Rather, he acknowledged the intractable problem of accounting for its emergence through natural processes. However, the problems are not limited to the prebiotic production of chemical compounds. Critical analysis of any proposed prebiotic route exposes similar problems. For the sake of argument, however, one might ask, “What if these molecules were freely available? Can unattended chemical events account for the emergence of the cell’s metabolic systems and the origin of self-replicating molecules?”",0,1480346210,2016-11-28 10:16:50

Asexual reproduction is more efficient, so when conditions are good they will specialize on that. Sexual reproduction results in more varied offspring better capable of surviving environmental change or attack from diseases.

As for how this process started, it was probably something similar to the kinds of systems we see in [bacterial conjunction.] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation)",1,1480277456,2016-11-27 15:10:56
64,"Forgive me for copy-and-pasting, but I wrote an explanation for this not too long ago. What follows is [that post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4vnvpt/how_sex_evolves/)

&amp;nbsp;

The evolution of sexual reproduction is a perpetual sticking point for creationists. Commonly framed as along the lines of, “how did the first female reproduce without any males?” or “sex couldn’t have evolved because it would requires males and females to appear at the same time,” these objections completely miss the robust understanding we have of the evolution of sexual reproduction.

&amp;nbsp;

Before we get to the how, let’s cover the why. So why have sex? Jokes aside, there are a lot of downsides – high energetic cost, high search cost (have to find a mate), can be dangerous, more susceptible to disease, sexual selection lead to detrimental traits, there are a **lot** of reasons why sex would be selected against. But it allows for greater genetic variation within a population. It does this through allowing for recombination between individuals, which allows for different allele combinations to appear more rapidly than in asexual populations. So you can combine beneficial alleles, or decouple a beneficial allele from a detrimental one, much more rapidly than in the absence of sexual reproduction.

&amp;nbsp;

This is primarily beneficial under two sets of conditions. First, when the environment changes rapidly or conditions are unfavorable, there is an enormous advantage to being about the shuffle the deck and try to generate a new genotype, which might be better suited to the present conditions. We see this is paramecium, which can reproduce sexually and asexually, and tend to do the former in hostile environments. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, sexual reproduction is beneficial in the context of complex interactions between different organisms, especially antagonistic relationships, such as that between a host and parasite. Both organisms are constantly imposing selective pressures on and adapting to the other, and the flexibility conferred by sexual recombination allows for the maintenance of a stable relationship, rather than one participant “winning” and the other “losing.” This is often described as the [Red Queen hypothesis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) named for the scene in “Through the Looking Glass.”

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s the why. Now how does that happen? It starts with a simple truth: Under many conditions, recombination confers a fitness advantage. In more ancestral organisms, bacteria and archaea, this can be accomplished by taking up exogenous DNA and incorporating into your own genome – the process of *transformation*. Some types of bacteria can do this directly, particularly when certain plasmids are present, via the process of *conjugation*. More broadly, we can group these processes together under the umbrella of *horizontal gene transfer*, the movement of genetic material between individuals in a population or in different populations.

&amp;nbsp;

Since they’re more complex, eukaryotes have a number of different way of accomplishing the same thing. Some unicellular organisms can just fuse, recombine, and divide under adverse conditions. Some filamentous green algae, like [spirogyra,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Spirogyra.JPG/1280px-Spirogyra.JPG) can line up in parallel, and adjacent cells can fuse. They then divide to return to a haploid state, swapping alleles along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some species have developed *mating types*, which are distinct forms that cannot mate with each other. For example, [chlamydamonas](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/studies/invertebrates/invertimages/chlamy.gif) has mt(+) and mt(-) types, and they can only mate with each other, but two mt(+) types cannot mate. Why should this happen? Well recombination is most effective when it’s between two very different individuals. If two very similar individuals mate, the likelihood of generating novel combinations of alleles is quite low. Having mating types promotes the mixing between more different individuals, and should therefore be selected for. In this example, we don’t yet have male and female, since the cells that fuse, the *gametes*, are not different between the two types.

&amp;nbsp;

In this situation, different strategies can emerge – put very little energy into many offspring, or put a lot of energy into very few. Selection can favor one or the other in the different mating types, leading to a divergence in gamete morphology. Individuals that make many, but put little E into each are males, individuals that make few with a high E investment are females. That’s the distinction between simple mating types and true sexes – differentiated gametes. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, true sexual reproduction exists, but we’ve only discussed unicellular organisms. It’s not too different in multicellularity, except that with more complexity, you can have selection acting on different aspects of the process, biased operational sex ratios, the ratio of breeding males to breeding females at any given time, can lead to things like sexual selection and sexual dimorphism.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll just finish up with a quick look at two organisms that demonstrate these dynamics: Paramecium and bdelloid rotifers. [Paramecia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Paramecium.jpg/610px-Paramecium.jpg) are unicellular ciliates and can reproduce asexually via [binary fission](http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca/ftp/biodidac/protista/ciliopho/photo/olih023p.gif) or sexually via [conjugation](http://bio1903.nicerweb.com/Locked/media/ch28/28_11bParamecReprod_2-L.jpg) (a very complicated process, not the same conjugation as described above). Generally, they are asexual, but when food is scarce or conditions hostile, they will conjugate. 

&amp;nbsp;

The [bdelloid rotifers](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/micropolitan/fresh/rotifer/philodina.jpg) are extremely interesting because they appear to be a rare example of a very ancient asexual lineage of animals. Rather than sexual reproduction, they have other mechanisms for fighting parasites and generating novel allelic combinations. They can dry out, killing any parasites, then rehydrate and go on their way. They also have weird genomes described as “degenerate tetraploid,” that is, they have four copies of their genome, but no one copy is complete. Instead, they have two incomplete sets of two copies each, and there can be intra-genomic recombination and gene conversion to increase diversity. In other words, they’ve evolved other mechanisms to accomplish the same things that sexual reproduction does in most organisms. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s a quick look at the evolution of sexual reproduction. There’s a lot more to talk about here (I didn’t even mention genome duplication!), but this is a good introduction and should help dispel some of the misunderstandings surrounding how sex could have appeared in the first place.",7,1480277440,2016-11-27 15:10:40

66,"&gt;  Is it incorrect of me to think that a male and female organism would need to evolve at the same time to cause this?

You're correct that that is incorrect.

The first sexually reproducing organisms weren't male and female, they were simply different mating types.

We still see this among many single-celled organisms today. They'll have 2 different strains, usually denoted as + and -, and those strains can fuse to form a zygote. Both strains are identical in appearance, but cannot sexually reproduce with their own strain.

Ann Gauger :  It's still worth considering how a mind might act in the world to cause change. The answer is we don't know. I sit here typing. My mind, mediated by my brain, is putting words into a computer program (designed by other minds, by the way), using my fingers to type. But how does it happen, really? Where does the impulse to press one key instead of another come from? And how do these words, products of my mind, communicate to others through their computer screens? We can't really say how our own minds work to interact with the world, yet we know they do. It is our universal, repeated, personal experience that shows us that our consciousness interacts with our bodies to produce information, but exactly how it works is not known. So why should we expect to know how the agent(s) responsible for the design of life or the universe may have worked? The theory of intelligent design does not propose a mechanism (a strictly or necessarily materialistic cause) for the origin of biological information. Rather, it proposes an intelligent or mental cause. In so doing, it does exactly what we want a good historical scientific theory to do. It proposes a cause that is known from our uniform and repeated experience (to borrow a phrase) to have the power to produce the effect in question, which in this case, is functional information in living systems.

The answer is: intelligence. Conscious activity. The deliberate choice of a rational agent. Indeed, we have abundant experience in the present of intelligent agents generating specified information. Our experience of the causal powers of intelligent agents -- of ""conscious activity"" as ""a cause now in operation""-- provides a basis for making inferences about the best explanation of the origin of biological information in the past. In other words, our experience of the cause-and-effect structure of the world -- specifically the cause known to produce large amounts of specified information in the present -- provides a basis for understanding what likely caused large increases in specified information in living systems in the past.

We are slowly getting out of a state of ignorance in regard of what mechanisms determines cell shape, assignment of their planes of division, tendencies to move, directions and rates of movement, modes of differentiation into particular cell types, and cell death (apoptosis).

The process of morphogenesis, which can be defined as an evolution of the form of an organism, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the life sciences. The discovery and description of the spatial– temporal distribution of the gene expression pattern during morphogenesis, together with its key regulators, is one of the main recent achievements in developmental biology. Nevertheless, gene expression patterns cannot explain the development of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space. 1",1,1480246642,2016-11-27 06:37:22

The last universal common ancestor represents the primordial cellular organism from which diversified life was derived.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2176-lucathe-last-universal-common-ancestor#3995

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2478661/
LUCA does not appear to have been a simple, primitive, hyperthermophilic prokaryote but rather a complex community of protoeukaryotes with a RNA genome, adapted to a broad range of moderate temperatures, genetically redundant, morphologically and metabolically diverse.

Life was born complex and the LUCA displayed that heritage.

 Recent comparative genomic studies support the latter model and propose that the urancestor was similar to modern organisms in terms of gene content.

http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic635406.files/Becerra%20et%20al%202007.pdf
Theoretical estimates of the gene content of the Last Common Ansestor’s genome suggest that it was not a progenote or a protocell, but an entity similar to extant prokaryotes.

http://news.illinois.edu/news/11/1005LUCA_ManfredoSeufferheld_JamesWhitfield_Caetano_Anolles.html
New evidence suggests that LUCA was a sophisticated organism after all, with a complex structure recognizable as a cell, researchers report. Their study appears in the journal Biology Direct. The study lends support to a hypothesis that LUCA may have been more complex even than the simplest organisms alive today, said James Whitfield, a professor of entomology at Illinois and a co-author on the study.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16431085
the estimate of LUCA's gene content appears to be substantially higher than that proposed previously, with a typical number of over 1000 gene families, of which more than 90% are also functionally characterized.a fairly complex genome similar to those of free-living prokaryotes, with a variety of functional capabilities including metabolic transformation, information processing, membrane/transport proteins and complex regulation, shared between the three domains of life, emerges as the most likely progenitor of life on Earth",1,1480246436,2016-11-27 06:33:56

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2243-no-evidence-that-rna-molecules-ever-had-the-broad-range-of-catalytic-activities

Paul Davies The Algorithmic Origins of Life 
Despite the conceptual elegance of the RNA world, the hypothesis faces problems, primarily due to the immense challenge of synthesizing RNA nucleotides under plausible prebiotic conditions and the susceptibility of RNA oligomers to degradation via hydrolysis 21 Due to the organizational structure of systems capable of processing algorithmic (instructional) information, it is not at all clear that a monomolecular system – where a single polymer plays the role of catalyst and informational carrier – is even logically consistent with the organization of information flow in living systems, because there is no possibility of separating information storage from information processing (that being such a distinctive feature of modern life). As such, digital–first systems (as currently posed) represent a rather trivial form of information processing that fails to capture the logical structure of life as we know it. 

We need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects of life, or the job is only half finished. Explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a solution to life’s origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside a computer. It is this transition where one should expect to see a chemical system literally take-on “a life of its own”, characterized by informational dynamics which become decoupled from the dictates of local chemistry alone (while of course remaining fully consistent with those dictates). Thus the famed chicken-or-egg problem (a solely hardware issue) is not the true sticking point. Rather, the puzzle lies with something fundamentally different, a problem of causal organization having to do with the separation of informational and mechanical aspects into parallel causal narratives. The real challenge of life’s origin is thus to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics.",1,1480246409,2016-11-27 06:33:29

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes


The Argument of the Original Replicator
In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication involves more than thirty specialized proteins to perform tasks necessary for building and accurately copying the genetic molecule.
Each of these proteins is essential and required for the proper replicating process. Not a single one of these proteins can be missing, otherwise the whole process breaks down, and is unable to perform its task correctly. DNA repair mechanisms must also be in place,  fully functional and working properly, otherwise the mutation rate will be too high, and the cell dies. 18
The individual parts and proteins require by themselves complex assembly proteins to be built.
The individual parts, assembly proteins, and proteins individually would have no function by their own. They have only function interconnected in the working whole. 
The individual parts must be readily available on the construction site of the rna replication complex, being correctly interlocked, interlinked, and have the right interface compatibility to be able to interact correctly together. All this requires information and meta information ( information that directs the expression of the genomic information for construction of the individual proteins, and correct timing of expression, and as well the information of the correct assembly sequence. )
Evolution is not a capable driving force to make the dna replicating complex, because evolution depends on cell replication through the very own mechanism we try to explain. It takes proteins to make DNA replication happen. But it takes the DNA replication process to make proteins. That’s a catch 22 situation.
DNA replication requires coded, complex, specified information and meta-information, and the DNA replication process is irreducibly complex.
Therefore, DNA replication is best explained through design. 

Ribosomes amazing nano machines

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1661-translation-through-ribosomes-amazing-nano-machines

The evidence from the ribosome
a. “Spontaneous formation of the unlocked state of the ribosome is a multi-step process.” 
b. The L1 stalks of the ribosome bend, rotate and uncouple – undergoing at least four distinct stalk positions while each tRNA ratchets through the assembly tunnel.  At one stage, for instance, “the L1 stalk domain closes and the 30S subunit undergoes a counterclockwise, ratchet-like rotation” with respect to another domain of the factory.  This is not simple.  “Subunit ratcheting is a complex set of motions that entails the remodeling of numerous bridging contacts found at the subunit interface that are involved in substrate positioning.”
c.The enzyme machine that translates a cell’s DNA code into the proteins of life is nothing if not an editorial perfectionist…the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products… To their further surprise, the ribosome lets go of error-laden proteins 10,000 times faster than it would normally release error-free proteins, a rate of destruction that Green says is “shocking” and reveals just how much of a stickler (insisting) the ribosome is about high-fidelity protein synthesis. (Rachel Green, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics: The Ribosome: Perfectionist Protein-maker Trashes Errors, 2009)
4. Interactions between molecules are not simply matters of matching electrons with protons.  Instead, large structural molecules form machines with moving parts.  These parts experience the same kinds of forces and motions that we experience at the macro level: stretching, bending, leverage, spring tension, ratcheting, rotation and translocation.  The same units of force and energy are appropriate for both – except at vastly different levels.
5. Every day, essays about molecular machines are giving more and more biomolecular details, many without mentioning evolution and giving details about the process how these machines evolved.
6. These complexities are the work of God.

That's just an expression of probability: There are a finite number of ways to assemble 26 letters, so if a random process assembles letters for long enough it will eventually produce a combination that a human reader would recognize as a particular story.

The author of this article is totally correct that no scientific theory can claim absolute - ie 100% - certainty. Yes, this is also true for the theory of evolution.

Based on the above, I would rate the level of certainty that the theory of evolution presents at about 99.999%.

134,"Here's the problem all creationists have when trying to understand science. They think that a scientist says ""Evolution is the only way to understand how we got here."" When what scientists mean is ""Evolution is the best way we have of understanding how we got here."" The difference is subtle, but boils down to this: Scientists develops hypothesis, exams and tests hypothesis, and then either discards it or it becomes a theory. The Theory of Evolution has been tested against evidence thousands of times, and has become refined since its inception. It no longer follows exactly what Darwin said it would, because Darwin was proven wrong in many instances. But the theory as a whole has been proven correct, as far as we know (the as far as we know part is important*). If someone were to introduce a competing theory that could be tested* (again super important), and it was proved evolution was false, scientists would follow the new theory. 

The reason Creationism cannot be considered is simple: we cannot test for the supernatural. It doesn't matter which religions' creationist story you use, be it Wiccan, Judeo-Christian, Hindu, or Shinto, none of those are testable. No experiments can be done to verify that they happened. If you came up with a way to test for God, and it proved to be true, scientists would be on board. But you cannot test for something that, by it's definition, exists apart from the physical world. 

Another problem with Creationism is that you use circular logic to arrive at an answer. ""The Bible says God created everything, therefore everything was created by God. And I know that this is true, because the Bible says that every word in the Bible is true."" Well, why take one book's word over any other's? Why believe that the Bible is a more true story than the Hindu Vedas? Those verses also claims to tell the origin story, yet you take the word of your Bible over another religion's word. How can we tell which revelation is the true one? The people that wrote each of those all had their own motivations for doing so.  ""But the authors of the Bible were divinely inspired!"" you might say. Well, how do we know they were divinely inspired? The only source we have that confirms that, is the book those very same ""inspired"" people wrote. 

Tl;dr Science can be tested. Creationism cannot. Creationism relies on believing that the people who wrote the book are divinely inspired, because the book they wrote says they were divinely inspired. ",4,1480186626,2016-11-26 13:57:06

But there is still a very small chance that we are wrong, and that the magnetic field comes from source that we know nothing about. It's possible - but it's very unlikely.

In the same manner, we can examine the DNA of apes and humans, and note that they share a very large number of sequences, including damaged genes.

&gt; ""A functioning cell must be entirely correct at once, in all its complexity, we are now closer to building a synthetic cell than anyone ever before us.""

Huck is a scientist working on constructing an artificial cell. Basically building the factory from scratch. It doesn't apply to this discussion because the cell in question is being built, not evolving.

Anyway, if you want an example of one possible precursor to the cell, look no further than the appropriately named [protocell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocell) These are formed when lipids (fats and oils) in water form into small bubbles. They aren't alive, but they display some of the traits of life. Such as the ability to grow via collecting more lipid molecules and reproduction when they're sheared in half by water movement.

Another possible precursor is RNA, as others have mentioned. RNA is a simpler, single-stranded version of DNA that's capable of functioning as both genetic material and as an enzyme to facilitate making copies of itself. It's also not alive by the way we define life but multiplies and has a system of heredity.

While there's still many competing theories, some believe that the first structure that we'd recognize as a living cell occurred when an self-replicating RNA strand ended up inside a protocell. 

Both components are non-living and capable of forming via simple chemistry. But together they become a something that's extremely close to what we'd define as life. Capable of descent with modification, which is all that we need for natural selection to take over. RNA inside a membrane would be kept safer from the environment and so as it kept reproducing, natural selection would pick those RNA variants that helped keep the membrane together and facilitated further reproduction.",6,1480104735,2016-11-25 15:12:15

One example is wood, and the question is: did wood evolve for support, or to move water and dissolved chemicals, or both at the same time? To answer this question, we look at the fossil record. Early Devonian plants lacked wood (i.e. secondary xylem) but possessed a structure called a cortical sterome made up of very tough cells. The cortical sterome provided support to keep plants upright. In the Early late Devonian (~405 mya), wood appeared in a plant called Franhueberia, but interestingly, Franhueberia has both wood and the cortical sterome. This suggests that wood initially evolved to transport water, as the cortical sterome was providing structural support of this plant. By the Middle Devonian, wood becomes more abundant in plants and the cortical sterome disappears. This suggests that wood gained a new function, it also provided structural support in addition to transporting water.

This is an example of a tissue evolving for one function (water transport) and then gaining a new function (structural support). This example also employs the concept of transition fossils. Every thing is a transition from one stage to another, but some organisms, like Franhueberia, are genuine transition fossils as they have tissues from an older less effective phenotype and a new derived, more effective phenotype.

Paul Davies The Algorithmic Origins of Life 
Despite the conceptual elegance of the RNA world, the hypothesis faces problems, primarily due to the immense challenge of synthesizing RNA nucleotides under plausible prebiotic conditions and the susceptibility of RNA oligomers to degradation via hydrolysis 21 Due to the organizational structure of systems capable of processing algorithmic (instructional) information, it is not at all clear that a monomolecular system – where a single polymer plays the role of catalyst and informational carrier – is even logically consistent with the organization of information flow in living systems, because there is no possibility of separating information storage from information processing (that being such a distinctive feature of modern life). As such, digital–first systems (as currently posed) represent a rather trivial form of information processing that fails to capture the logical structure of life as we know it. 

We need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects of life, or the job is only half finished. Explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a solution to life’s origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside a computer. It is this transition where one should expect to see a chemical system literally take-on “a life of its own”, characterized by informational dynamics which become decoupled from the dictates of local chemistry alone (while of course remaining fully consistent with those dictates). Thus the famed chicken-or-egg problem (a solely hardware issue) is not the true sticking point. Rather, the puzzle lies with something fundamentally different, a problem of causal organization having to do with the separation of informational and mechanical aspects into parallel causal narratives. The real challenge of life’s origin is thus to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics.",-9,1480101517,2016-11-25 14:18:37

Lets break down this analogy, shall we?

We agree that a modern factory is constructed by humans, correct? But we're only able to make them thanks to centuries of accumulated knowledge.

Even Leonardo da Vinci, arguably one of the most brilliant inventors humanity has ever produced, couldn't have made something with the complexity of a computer-controlled assembly line because he didn't have that knowledge to build off of. Just as a modern cell with all it's intricate cellular machinery couldn't come into existence as the first living thing on earth.

Both the modern factory and the modern cell are descended from MUCH simpler designs. And thanks to untold generations of tinkering and improvement, they've become incredibly complex pieces of machinery.

What you're doing when you try to use this argument is equivalent to pointing at a modern factory and saying 'It's totally implausible that humans constructed this perfectly in one attempt, therefore aliens gave them the knowledge to do so.'

Not only did you try to replace as many words as you could to make this sound as ""engineer-y"" as possible instead of using the normal words a biologist would use, no, but this whole paragraph is completely unnecessary because it's just descriptive, nothing else.

It doesn't prove a point. It doesn't prove a designer. It only tries to sound as amazing and astounded as possible. How is this an argument again other than an appeal to emotions?


&gt; They had to emerge ALL AT ONCE, No stepwise manner is possible, all systems are INTERDEPENDENT and IRREDUCIBLE.

Irreducible complexity is a flawed myth that has been debunked as many times as you have appeared in this subreddit with your quote babbling. No, all of this did not have to ""emerge all at once"" and all of these systems are not ""interdependent and irreducible"".

&gt; And it could not be through evolution, since evolution depends on fully working self replicating cells, in order to function.

[Citation needed]. And not even that, it's completely wrong. Source: Any research in the past couple of years involving chemical evolution, self-replicating RNA, Ribozymes and the likes. Evolution already happens with simple chemicals.

&gt; How can someone rationally argue that the origin of the most sophisticated factory in the universe would be probable to be based on natural occurence, without involving any guiding intelligence ?

Because we are amassing more and more evidence for how self-replicating RNA molecules can become what we call life and we are advancing our knowledge.

&gt;There appears to be no hard evidence that Vpu acquired any new functions since it infected humans. 

See the bait-and-switch?

The observation with regard to HIV Vpu evolution is that it acquired new functions compared to SIVcpz Vpu *prior to the crossover into humans*. Luskin is claiming that, since different variants of HIV Vpu exhibit different affinities for the parts of the cell where it carries out its two functions, both functions are present in all forms of HIV-1, and therefore neither of these functions evolved in HIV-1.

&amp;nbsp;

Uh, yeah? Nobody's claiming the new function evolved in HIV-1. In fact, that'd be absurd. The new functionality is a *prerequisite* to HIV-1's crossover into humans. The relevant comparison is not between different subtypes of HIV-1, but between the Vpu of *any* variant of HIV-1 and that of SIVcpz, from which HIV-1 evolved. And when you make that comparison, you see a clear gain of function.

&amp;nbsp;

And Casey Luskin knows this. He knows comparisons between HIV-1 subtypes are irrelevant to this discussion. So does Michael Behe. They're just liars for Jesus.

No.

As far as I remember (because I have no interest to search it right now), the closest case of finding something similar is when scientists found extremely old dinosaur soft tissue. It's either at 55 Mya or 75 Mya but never did we ever confirm DNA, which would be cool to have btw.

___

I still looked it up for you in case you were interested:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Soft_tissue_and_DNA

&gt; In the March 2005 issue of Science, the paleontologist Mary Higby Schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team. When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.

&gt; In 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a duck-billed dinosaur, Brachylophosaurus canadensis, found in the Judith River Formation of Montana. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was collagen, as in the Tyrannosaurus bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its DNA and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.

&gt; The extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions; upon further inspection and peer review, however, neither of these reports could be confirmed. However, a functional peptide involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds. In addition, several proteins, including hemoglobin, have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.

&gt; In 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75 million years old.

There have been a few fragments of DNA recovered from fossils, but they're unreadable and probably just contamination. In fact, the data shows it's unlikely that any DNA will ever be recovered from dinosaur fossils.

'Clean' samples, such as those extracted from the inside of amber, have never been found to contain any DNA whatsoever. And studies have shown that even under ideal conditions, DNA still breaks down over time.

The oldest fossil we've ever managed to recover DNA from was a [700,000 year old horse bone.](http://www.livescience.com/37762-ancient-horse-genome-sequenced.html) Which is pretty impressive but still a very far cry from getting dinosaur DNA.",9,1479855506,2016-11-22 17:58:26

&gt;The origin of the RNA world: Co-evolution of genes and metabolism

""We propose here a mechanism""

So, speculative fiction? Can't access the paper, but does not appear to be based on any experimental evidence.

&gt;The Origins of the RNA World

This is actually the first one I read and it set the tone for the rest: hopeful, but entirely inconclusive, if not ultimately negative.

""Another Chicken-and-Egg Paradox
The previous discussion has tried mightily to present the most optimistic view possible for the emergence of an RNA replicase ribozyme from a soup of random-sequence polynucleotides. It must be admitted, however, that this model does not appear to be very plausible. The discussion has focused on a straw man: The myth of a small RNA molecule that arises de novo and can replicate efficiently and with high fidelity under plausible prebiotic conditions. Not only is such a notion unrealistic in light of current understanding of prebiotic chemistry (Joyce 2002), but it should strain the credulity of even an optimist's view of RNA's catalytic potential. If you doubt this, ask yourself whether you believe that a replicase ribozyme would arise in a solution containing nucleoside 5′-diphosphates and polynucleotide phosphorylase!""

I am thankful for the work synthetic chemists are able to perform. In my opinion they are the rock stars of science. But, as the more realistic of them will admit, there are so many problems involved in the RNA world it begins to dawn that on some that it is simply untenable.

""There has been significant progress, especially recently, concerning the synthesis of the nucleosides and nucleotides from prebiotic precursors in reasonable yield. However, the story remains incomplete because these syntheses still require temporally separated reactions using high concentrations of just the right reactants, and would be disrupted by the presence of other closely related compounds.""

Even to the point of abandoning the RNA world concept, or at least making it subordinate to other potential processes. 

""The problems that arise when one tries to understand how an RNA World could have arisen de novo on the primitive Earth are sufficiently severe that one must explore other possibilities.""

&gt;Patterns in Palaeontology: The first 3 billion years of evolution

I was just going to write this off as a nice bedtime story, but I've been wanting to address a specific issue and this seems like an excellent opportunity. This article explores two theories, boiled down to cool/aquatic and hot/volcanic, but it only addresses a major plot hole for both in the hot/volcanic theory.

""If this was the case, the first ‘life’ would not have possessed informational molecules.""

This would, invariably, apply to *any* proposal for abiogenesis. Is there a study demonstrating any lasting form of information arising from non-biological processes? The chemistry has to, somehow, combine into at least a basic machine code to allow any development past RNA/DNA, or there are no cell walls, organelles, no energy storage/processing. Nothing that could be considered life. Mutations and other adaptations confer changes on pre-existing information systems (DNA, RNA) but, to my knowledge, have never developed any processes, much less organelles, *de novo* (""from scratch""). 

There is one experiment that stripped all the ""non-essential"" codons, those not absolutely required for continued function/reproduction, and it still left...

""531,000 DNA building blocks containing 473 genes"" 

That's still an incredible amount of information. And, now follow me on this one, it has probably lost any ability, whatsoever, to adapt to an environment substantially different from that provided in laboratory.

I would LOVE to see this thing entered into something similar to the LTEE regimen, but more varied. Expose it to viruses, other bacteria (especially those of it's original DNA), various growth media. Let's see what happens! THAT would be interesting. 

Additionally, as briefly mentioned above, the problem of autochirality has never been satisfactorily addressed, and it's a huge hurdle.

&gt;The RNA Worlds in Context

This is not itself, a research paper and does not cover any new ground, with respect to the previous links.

""Opinions vary, however, as to whether RNA comprised the first autonomous self-replicating system or was a derivative of an earlier system. Benner et al. (2010) and Robertson and Joyce (2010) are circumspect, noting that the complexity and the chiral purity of modern RNA create challenges for thinking about it arising de novo.""

&gt;Getting Past the RNA World: The Initial Darwinian Ancestor

Once again, hopeful, but woefully inconclusive.

""Replication thus remains an essential issue to be decided. And even beyond replication, there are many footholds for a critic in the ideas above.""

&gt;Thermodynamics might be the driving force behind abiogenesis.

“You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant,” England said.

So why doesn't it happen all the time? This is, on it's face, an indefensible, even ridiculous, statement.

Or it requires RNA to be already extant.

""Once RNA arose, he argues, its “Darwinian takeover” was perhaps not surprising.""

&gt;Organic macromolecular compounds found on comet

Very cool, but even the commentators make no connection between this discovery and RNA, or even evolution in general. Not certain why it's here.

&gt;We have no less than a buttload of evidence for abiogenesis.

Not really. What you have are, often contradictory, graspings for straws. Several links are no more than commentary on the actual research. Research that is not only inconclusive but inadequate to explain abiogenesis.


The building blocks of life ""have been reported by simulating drying ponds, hydrothermal vents, volcanic eruptions and collisions of chondrites with the primitive ocean,"" said Lazcano. ""Good!""

&gt;Basic ingredients of RNA synthesized in lab replicating prebiotic conditions.

Yes, they synthesized components necessary for RNA, which is an achievement in and of itself (I'm not anti-science, I appreciate the incredible effort and imagination exercised by this team). But let's look at the big picture.

Where are the rest of the necessary reactions? How did they arise in any proximity? How did they maintain their structure long enough to combine if they did arise near enough to each other? 

Honestly, those questions are moot, because these couldn't have been generated outside a laboratory, despite the title. Don't take my word for it.

""However, Robert Shapiro, professor emeritus of chemistry at New York University disagrees. 'Although as an exercise in chemistry this represents some very elegant work, this has nothing to do with the origin of life on Earth whatsoever,' he says. According to Shapiro, it is hard to imagine RNA forming in a prebiotic world along the lines of Sutherland's synthesis.

And heat, and ultraviolet radiation, chiral precursors (which have their own, immense, level of difficulty, as in homochirality), and pH balances, etc. Each step may have been based on conditions that may have existed, but were not consistent from step to step. The introduction of ultraviolet light, in specific steps, *alone* had to be limited and carefully monitored or it would have ruined the process. Almost a deal breaker, in and of itself. 

If you would like an overview of how difficult these processes are to achieve, even in a lab, check out some of James Tours' reviews.

&gt;Synthesized RNA enzymes that can replicate themselves without the help of any proteins or other cellular components.

This is, admittedly, very cool. What I can read, however, makes no mention of what had to be added to the mix for the replications to continue.

""Immortalized"" RNA, they call it, **at least within the limited conditions of a laboratory.**

(From NPR interview transcript) - ""They were actually able to make copies of each other over and over, *as long as they were given the right parts to put together*.""

How did they generate the precursors? I could make a slew of arguments here, but if you've actually been reading the linked material and **think** about it, you'll already know most of them.

""Only when a system is developed in the lab that has the capability of evolving novel functions on its own can it be properly called life, Joyce said.""

This is an apt statement. As the replicating components become more complex they will require commensurately greater support mechanisms. I suspect we *might* be able to code computer simulations that will approximate the needed infrastructure, but doing so under real-time laboratory conditions may not be feasible past an, as yet undetermined, level of complexity.


&gt;Amino acids created in lab under prebiotic conditions.

I looked up the paper upon which this article is based. There are so many conjectures as to what it *might* indicate that it really doesn't mean or say anything outside of the label given here in this post. 

I attempted to paste the relevant section here but was told I had exceeded the number of articles I could access for the week.

&gt;Experiment shows how it is possible for fatty acids, amines and an amino acid called glycine to have formed during the late heavy bombardment.

""Certain simple organic molecules have been shown to form under conditions resembling meteorite impacts, although the link between these events and the development of more complex molecules remains unclear.""

This, like many other experiments, really just demonstrates chemistry. And, as supported from the first link's reply, often complex chemistry that cannot possibly represent prebiotic conditions, even when it utilizes ""simpler"" chemicals. Or you have conditions like the Miller experiment and this one that, while not complex, don't really generate anything that can be used to achieve biology.

""In terms of forming protocell membranes, it would be important to form longer-chain fatty acids than were seen in the current experiments,"" he said.

We will have to wait and see if further investigation provides more useful yields, but simple conditions don't seem likely to yield complex compounds.    

&gt;Sugar molecules have been found in space, having formed naturally.

""Overall, Jorgesen said the “big question” is how complex these molecules would need to become before being incorporated into new planets.""

A whole lot more complex. And they would have to survive the process of incorporation. This is chemistry on a relatively basic level, much like the previous entry.

&gt;Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism

""To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry.""

""We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of ​hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry.""

It is easy to agree to every part of these statements, except the last phrase. It seems an incredible stretch to go from precursors to ""all the cellular subsystems"" arising based on ""common chemistry."" The difference in complexity is exponential, to say the least.

&gt;Making Sense of the Chemistry That Led to Life on Earth

""Dr. Sutherland’s chemicals cannot all be mixed together at once. His reaction scheme requires them to be delivered in sequence to a central pool.""

""Steven Benner, the **director of the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution** in Gainesville, Fla., said that many of the reactions in Dr. Sutherland’s scheme “aren’t real,” meaning that pure chemicals might react as proposed in the laboratory but that the process could not be expected to proceed the same way in a natural mix of chemicals.""

""Dr. Benner also noted that the popular idea of an RNA world is burdened with several unresolved paradoxes. One is that if you have a pool of chemicals and pump energy in, “you don’t get life, you get asphalt,” he said, meaning that the chemicals will react together to form a gooey tar. Another is that water is essential for life, as are nucleotides, but water destroys nucleotides. A third problem is that RNA is assumed to act as an enzyme and as a store of genetic information, but the two roles require contradictory properties: An enzyme must fold up and be reactive, while a genetic molecule should do neither.""

Wow! I could have saved myself some trouble if I had just found these quotes first. This is no creationist or ID enthusiast, but he very neatly summed up a lot of what I've been arguing. I *love* the asphalt line! Nice to see an honest evolutionist.

Precisely because, like machines invented by humans to deal efficiently with the macroscopic world, these protein assemblies contain highly co-ordinated moving parts. - Bruce Alberts, President of The National Academy of Sciences

Yes, I agree with that! Almost every scientist would agree with that. Children learn about the magnificently efficient inner workings of modern cells in school.
But NOTHING about this is an argument against evolution or for any sort of deity! Why would you even think that? Because the poor man used a comparison to machines built by humans, when describing the complexity of the cell? A lot of organs have evolved to be incredibly complex and efficient over literally billions of years. 
At best, this is an argument from incredulity. It is also most definitely a quotemine, and whichever apologist put that quote out of context and made it seem like an argument against evolution should probably apologize to dr Alberts, who most certainly does not think that the cell is anything other than the result of natural evolution.
This is intellectual dishonesty at it's best.

&gt;Molecular evolution is not based on scientific authority. There is no publication in the scientific literature – in prestigious journals, specialty journals, or books – that describes how molecular evolution of any real, complex, biochemical system either did occur, or even might have occurred. There are assertions that such evolution occurred, but absolutely none is supported by pertinent experiments or calculations… despite comparing sequences and mathematical modeling, molecular evolution has never addressed the question of how complex structures came to be. In effect, the theory of Darwinian molecular evolution has not published, and so it should perish. - Michael Behe

This one is the only one of your last 4 quotes not quotemined or presented out of context. However, it is also the only one that can be firmly and completely dismantled as incorrect. I don't even have to do it myself,
this very notion was at the center of a famous legal trial, in which Behe was called as a witness, testifying for the notion that there was any validity to intelligent design and irreducible complexity.
During this trial, other scientists have shown at length and quite demonstrably, that Behe was factually wrong about this claim. After their rebuttals ended, he was presented with over 100 peer reviewed articles, books and textbooks, showing that evolutionary pathways that he had previously proclaimed unexplainable by science, had in fact bee explained. He also had no choice but to admit that there were no peer reviewed papers supporting the idea of irreducible complexity, and that under the definition of the word ""theory"" he used to include intelligent design, astrology would also be a part of science.
In the end, the (very conservative) judge ruled that ID and irreducible complexity was NOT science, based on the complete scientific debunking that Behe had experienced. 
It does not get any more definitive than that. So, why would someone like Dr Behe, with a background in biology, make such grave mistakes?
That was answered in the trial as well, where Behe (and I quote) ""remarkably and unmistakably claim[ed] that the plausibility of the argument for ID depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of God.""
This is a very important part to understand. That is the reason why if you want to present an expert's opinion, it is a very valid criticism to point out that they are apologists!
(While I'm at the topic, it should also be worth noting that Dr. Lennox, as a mathematician, has no expertise in biology, in addition to being a christian apologist. Obviously, any argument should stand on its own merit [and his don't, as I have shown several times now], regardless of who it comes from, but humans do tend to value the opinion of an expert more than a layperson, sometimes rightfully. So I just thought it couldn't hurt to point that out. At the very least it could help explain why someone who is so intelligent in one field would make such basic and avoidable mistakes.)

The last quote, by Stephen J Gould is another classical quotemine. Dr Gould has gone on record several times and made it very clear that he is not and never was in any way a proponent of anything that could be regarded as creationism, and in fact actively campaigned against it. He has expressed his displeasure that quotes of his, halfunderstood und taken out of context, have been used by dishonest creationists and apologists to mislead gullible audiences. I don't know where you got that quote, but whoever fed it to you is intellectually dishonest on the highest level, given Dr Gould's public outcry over the misuse of his quotes.

Now on to the last point. At this point, looking at the track record of these quotes you have provided, it should not come as any surprise, that this one is quite simply wrong. 
There are hundreds of papers, detailing the evolution of biochemical systems. 
If you can't believe that anyone would be so dishonest as to portray something this objectively wrong in such a misleading way, go ahead, go to any database of scientific publications and 
look for yourself. There are far, FAR too many to list them all, but let me get you started with a few examples:

280,"Thanks for your response, I am learning. In one of Richard Dawkins books he explains that the odds of a million monkeys typing Shakespeare is tiny, but if each time a correct letter was hit it is kept and a wrong one is ignored the probability becomes reasonable. With natural and sexual selection, the good mutations are kept and the bad ones selected out, making evolution much more likely. If we are saying that mutations with no negative effect can form and propagate, but not actually be selected for until further random mutations, then this decreases the odds greatly to something like, ""every time a monkey types a proper word it is kept"". In this way the systems are ""irreducibly complex"" in that without the other chance mutations that weren't selected for, be it anatomy or behaviour, the system could not work. I have never heard this argument before for ""irreducible complexity by chance"", it has always been trying to prove systems had beneficial simpler forms.

There are a number of insects where the male eat little or nothing and literally only exist to be a sperm donor. Ants and bees come to mind, but I'm sure there are plenty of others.

&amp;nbsp;

If other species develop the same way humans do, female is the default sex. When a human fetus develops it has the tissue to make male and female genitals, without the presence of a certain hormone(the exact one escapes me at the time) the gonades will form ovaries, and Fallopian tubes and a vagina will form. However, in males, the hormone is released that suppresses that grow and instead activates the tissues that become the vas deferens, the gonads become testicles and a penis forms. Ever wonder why testicles have the line down the middle, almost as if two separate pieces of flesh grew together? They did. So it isn't really to surprising that males get the short end of the genetic stick.",2,1479649019,2016-11-20 08:36:59
289,"(Sorry if I'm difficult to read. Non native speaker and this is higher than my normal conversation level ^^)

&gt; I would have thought it would need more to be actively selected

For the evolution and inheritance of a trait it is enough to not select against this trait, we can call this passive selection if you want. A mutation that is not detrimental can be inherited for a very long time before another mutation uses the first mutation and makes it a positive mutation. In my example the possible digestion of blood would be such a neutral mutation. After, by some chance or whatever, the mosquito fed on blood and it was possible to include the blood nutrients into the egg building process it had become a positive mutation.

I don't know what exactly you mean when you say ""Is this the position of evolution?"". If you mean that evolution says that it is a possibility that ""they all evolved within a timeframe by chance with no active selection to produce an irreducibly complex system"" than I would say, delete the ""irreducibly"" and you can go with it.  
When we encounter a system that seams irreducibly complex, most of the time this is because we don't have acces to its predecessors. I have yet to see a system that is truly irreducibly complex. This would als mean, that we should see the same system in an unchanged form in all ancestors of the animal/plant/fungus.

290,"&gt;Also used for nectar

I hadn't thought of this, and concede that this is a good explanation

&gt;As long as digesting blood does not reduce the ability to digest nectar

I would have thought it would need more to be actively selected. Without active selection this and the behaviour to extract blood would need to evolve randomly by chance which even if this does not happen simultaneously, statistically reduces the probability. At this point there is still no benefit to select for (otherwise male mosquitoes would), so a third random step is needed to use this digested blood to improve egg production. This means that they all evolved within a timeframe by chance with no active selection to produce an irreducibly complex system. Is this the position of evolution?",2,1479645940,2016-11-20 07:45:40
291,"Your challenge for the evolutionist as you call them would be how to explain *a specific mechanism*: how did certain traits historically evolve into their present state following the otherwise well known biochemical/genetic/environmental pathways such as random mutation and non-random selection.

292,"&gt; the apparatus to extract blood

It is also used to extract nectar from plants. Little adaptions needed to be made to use it for extracting blood. These adaptions seam not to influence the extraction for nectar. Therefore it can evolve at an arbitrary point before the evolution of the blood sucking habit.

&gt; The digestive and reproductive systems that can take advantage this blood. 

As long as the ability to digest blood is not detremental to the survivability of mosquitos, e.g. does not reduce the ability to dogest nectar in a deadly manner, it also can evolve at an arbitrary point before the habbit of blood sucking.

&gt;  the behaviour (which is hard wired) to find suitable hosts to extract blood

And this is part three. We have a mosquito with tools to suck blood, which evolved independendly, the ability to digest blood, which evolved independendly, and then some mutation let it sought out a wound to ingest blood, which showed to be a very good source for some nutrients for egg development.

302,"&gt;Now an analogy would be like alphabet soup. So, if you ever played with alphabet soup, you kinda stir it and you hope to see a word like “cat”, but there is no way you can stir your alphabet soup or boil it and get, let’s say, the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. You can't get that because the chemistry of the pasta, or the physics of the boiling water. Highly specific arrangements of letters for a given purpose, like to convey a message, can only be done through intelligence. Well if you look at the DNA and the information in the cell, that also can only be explained by intelligence.

I have to ask... do you happen to be a molecular biology student?  Because basic genetics 101 would show this to be utterly untrue.  The genetic code has inherent redundancies (the technical term is ""degeneracy"") that allows for multiple codons to code for the same amino acid.  Additionally, even if a mutation causes a codon to switch one amino acid for another, much of the time the new amino acid is chemically similar enough to the old that there's little to no impact.

This is why across animal species we all have genes for hemoglobin that are similar but not identical, and indeed can be vastly different.  So multiple ""spellings"" of the same ""word"" give the same result.  The kind of specificity Miller describes here just doesn't apply to biology.

Of course, the analogy is pretty piss-poor even without taking this into account, because a single gene can have multiple functions, or even a new function that gets adapted for use elsewhere.


&gt;So these and other reasons are why secular evolutionists are abandoning Neo-Darwinism. Now in addition, what you find is that there's positive evidence for design in nature. What happens is a body plan is controlled by DNA, and DNA is kind of like the digital code in a computer. It has information, and information is only the product of a mind. You can't evolve information except for very, very small amounts. So you look at these major transitions, that tells you that you have huge amounts of new information being injected into your genome, but information can only be produced by a mind.

Please define exactly what Miller means by ""information"" in this context.  A lot of Creationists have tried to use the term ""information"" promiscuously to make their point, but once you break down the definition they're using generally they're either vague to the point of meaningless obfuscation, or they refer to something trivial that doesn't entail design at all.",2,1479601516,2016-11-19 19:25:16

&gt;esearchers that have studied these developmental pathways have recognized that any mutation which alters that developmental pathway which changes the basic body plan is harmful. From observation, from theory, you can't change a body plan through random mutations.

Well, surely Dr. MIller knows that a sudden, radical change in ""body plan"" (a term I doubt you'll find in any credentialed researcher's writings) isn't the mechanism that would be at work here; a starfish egg doesn't just all of a sudden hatch into something like a sea anemone. 

Just as every child is the exact same species as both of its parents (yes, yes, except for mules, etc), it will also have the same ""body plan"" as both parents. But not every *descendant* of that child or its parents will be the same species and ""body plan""--even though each generation will, in its turn, always be the same species as its own parents.

Top secular scientists understand this. (They have to, because otherwise nobody would have been around to explain it to me.) They also understand that ""random mutation"" is not the driving element here, and that any harmful mutations (in net harm terms, that is) would be taken care of by natural selection.

According to creationists, all life on earth originated at basically the exact same time, and so should be represented throughout the fossil record.

Genetics Proves Evolution: The Creationist's Galileo Moment
by A.Paliden

When you look at a chicken embryo with a microscope as it starts to develop you will see that they have teeth buds and the beginnings of multi segmented tails. As they develop their DNA, which among other things contains activation switches, tells the developing embryo to absorb them.  This is the same process by which humans absorb their own vestigial tails.

Now if you turn off the genes that control this absorption instruction you get chicken embryos that develop long multi segmented dinosaur tails and meat eating dinosaur teeth.  Both results of which can bee seen using a simple magnification. Other studies have also been successful in changing scales to feathers.

The process used to do this is called atavism activation.

The same is also true for the chicken penis. The genome has the genes tor create it but it is not found in the modern chicken. It starts to grow and then is absorbed. Although this particular event is only visible with an electron microscope. 

This is not hypothesis.  This is not supposition.  This is not interpretation.  This is cold hard, hold in your hands see with your own eyes type reproducible proof. 

It should be noted that at no time was any DNA  ever added to or removed from the chicken DNA.  This was done using 100% pure chicken DNA.

They have shown that bird DNA contains genes that create dinosaur characteristics and the only way this can happen is through the  process described by The Theory of Evolution.

So like when Galileo first pointed his telescope at the heavens and learned that Aristotle was wrong modern scientists have pointed their microscopes at developing bird embryos and learned that they are correct.

The Theory of Evolution is real.

342,"&gt;[...] micro-evolution and macro-evolution. Regardless, I'm certain that you are aware that many individuals (rightly or wrongly) do make that distinction.

Wrongly. There is a biological term called micro evolution, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the usage of the word that creationists employ. Since evolution has not only an impressive amount of evidence in genetics, paleontolgy, phylogentics, or anatomy, but has also been observed directly both in field and lab conditions, it has become very hard to deny it happens. For some reason, the direct observation was the evidence that somehow stuck out to creationists, despite the other evidence being just as hard and valid. Probably because none of them were scientists, to intuitively, seeing something happen is the milestone of undeniability to them. Regardless of why, in order to maintain the position at all, there was a shift towards ""Okay, guess evolution does happen, but as long as no one has directly observed it happening for thousands of years, we can still say only the relatively minor changes we have observed are possible"".

But here is the thing: As I said, there is no biological distinction between the creationist ideas of micro and macro evolution, except time. I challenge you to find any mechanism that would stop those speciation- and even ""family-fication "" events  that we HAVE directly observed (micro evolution) from accumulating into splits on the level of new orders, classes or even phyla (which would be examples of macro evolution). There simply isn't one, and no creationist has even put forth one.
If you would indulge me, I'd like to describe why such a magic barrier mechanism that suddenly stops change from accumulating would be necessary, in order to believe in speciation, but not in evolution as a whole.
Because it really isn't intuitive to grasp for most people, so I like to employ a little visual analogy. 
Let's say this yellow color represent a chicken: http://imgur.com/a/AK3tR
And let's say this blue color represents a nonavian dinosaur, an ancestor of the chicken: http://imgur.com/a/RrXcx
Looking at both, we can probably agree that the two are as different a night and day. Fitting, since they represent two animals looking and behaving very differently. Creationists would argue the chicken could not have evolved from the dinosaur, even if they accept microevolution, the changes necessary are just too much.

Now let's look at this blue color, it represents a great-great-great-great-great-something-granddaughter of the original nonavian dinosaur: http://imgur.com/a/rqR0g
If we put both blue colors side by side, we can see they are similiar to the point where most people can't tell them apart. Which makes sense, considering what they represent. The small changes we would see between any animal and it's direct descendants for a few generations is quite small. There can be changes, sure, but that would be microevolution, so it's okay, even for some creationists. 

I could now show you another pair of colors, this time yellow, again so similiar you would be hard pressed to tell them apart. And I could tell you it the great-great-etc-grandpa of the chicken, and our end-result chicken. And again, no one would object saying that those small changes in the animals, and the colors they represent aren't perfectly plausible. And then I could go on and do that a few thousand times, each time showing you a pair of colors, virtually indistinguishable from each other, and yet, slightly different. And each time it would be hard for anyone to argue that if those differences in color represent the differences in genetics (and phenotype) of two animals, those difference can easily be explained by evolution. (Even those creationists, that accept microevolution.)

But here is the thing. After I've done that, I'd show you all of those thousands of almost identical pairs together:
http://imgur.com/a/cWWAW

Every pixel in this spectrum is located next to a pixel that has such a similiar color, that you won't even be able to tell them apart. Try it out. Download the picture, open it with any image editing program, even paint, and take the colors of any two adjacent pixels. You won't find any that are so different that most people could even tell them apart.

And yet....the start and end result are incredibly different, as we've established from the very beginning. But that's how evolution works.
And that's why people who believe in micro evolution, but nor macro evolution have a big problem. They have already accepted that small changes are possible over the course of a couple of generations. But the more unintuitive consequence of that is that the small changes accumulate and, over a couple thousand generations, would result in vastly different outcomes, even if every step along the way is the small change they already admitted to being possible. As I pointed out, no one has ever proposed a serious mechanism to stop the small changes from accumulating. We obviously don't have a perfect lineup of transitions, from parent to child, through thousands of generations. But we already have some remarkably complete sets of transitional fossils, showing the path from some extinct species to other most recent species. The individual transitional species are often similiar enough to each other, that even a creationist would admit that those small changes would fall into what they consider micro evolution. 
This is something that is quite hard to grasp on an intuitive level, but that is how evolution works. And that is why it makes absolutely no sense for anyone who understands anything about the topic to believe speciation exists, but somehow no evolution beyond that.

I will adress your quotes in the next post, this has already been a rather long one, and it already contained some of the most important things to understand about evolution and why those ""criticisms"" of evolution are all rooted in misunderstanding and ignorance.",2,1479510103,2016-11-18 18:01:43
343,"While Dr Lennox apparantly did read the part where Dawkins explains the limitations of analogies, he amazingly still makes the mistake of misunderstanding it by trying to apply it too literally. The excerpts you have posted pretty much can all be addressed by the same correction I provided yesterday, so I think I did not explain it well enough. 

Dawkins Analogy uses a phrase as a accumulation of slightly advantageous traits. It does not have to be the phrase ""Me thinks it is a weasel"", he could have picked any phrase, any combination of letters as a stand-in for traits that provide a benefit in any given environment. We can agree that some traits are more advantageous than others in certain environments, right? And we can agree that those traits do NOT have to be predetermined in advance for it to be true that they are simply better. 

Let me use a hypothetical example: There is a (hypothetical) species of bird with a distinct, long beak. This long beak is the optimum for their way of finding food, since they pick insects out of crevices! We can agree that having a long beak is more advantageous to those bird than having a shorter beak, all other things being equal, right? Without anyone having to predefine ""long beak"" as advantageous, it simply is more positive than any alternative. Now, let's apply this to Dawkins Analogy. In his Analogy, the phrase ""Me thinks it is a weasel"" is equivalent to fully formed long beaks in these birds. Now, what his analogy does is explain to a layperson, how this long-beaked species of bird could have evolved from a different species with short beaks. From time to time, mutations occur (the monkeys type random letters), and members of the original species of bird can survive better or worse based on what direction the random mutations happen to go in. If they slightly elongate the beak, they are more likely to survive and mate. (any random letters being the right one in the phrase ""Me thinks it is a weasel"" represent each a mutation that slightly increases beak length.)
A mutation that doesn't change their beak size, or even decreases it means they are less likely to survive of mate, compared to the longer beaked birds. (Any letter not correctly set in the weasel-phrase represents such a neutral or disadvantageous mutation.) Since the advantageous mutations are more likely to reproduce and be passed on, they will over time become dominant in the gene pool, and accumulate into the fully formed distinct long beaks. (The correct letters being kept.)

*Note how we did NOT have to set a goal, we simply looked at something which already existed, and explained how it got to be such a good fit for its environment.* The birds in my hypothetical example could have also evolved stronger, stout beaks to pry open the crevices, then the analogy would have just as well worked with that. Or they could have evolved the ability to digest other food sources. The ""goal"" does not ever have to be one specific outcome, the ""goal"" in nature is simply to be better adapted than your competitors. Calling it a ""goal"" would even be misleading, since no one sets it. It's simply that those organisms that are better adapted tend to be more likely to survive and pass on the traits that made them better adapted in the first place. These ""solutions"" to different environments are not something that has to be defined in advanced, long beaks are a/one good way of getting to insects, even since before any bird starting evolving them. And Dawkins Analogy takes any given solution and explains how it arises. It does not require a goal in mind, and it does work with small steps.

With that (hopefully) better understanding in mind, look at this quote:

&gt;Suppose that, after spinning the discs for a while, we had half the letters right, something like the sequence MDTUIFKQINIOAFERSCL (every other letter is correct). The analogy asserts that this is an improvement over a random string of letters, and that it would somehow help us open the lock…. If your reproductive success depended on opening the lock, you would leave no offspring.

Read my example with the hypothetical birds again, and then see if you can tell me, where Lennox missed the very idea of the analogy.
Seriously, before i give the answer, take a minute and look at it, I even provided what all the elements in the analogy represent in real world evolution. Look at that, and then look at Lennox's misunderstanding of what the analogy actually wants to show.


As I'm sure you already got, **dr. Lennox implying all the letters have to be in place at once before it provides any benefit is missing the very core of what Dawkins explains with this analogy. The (correct) individual letters represent small improvements, each one a small change that makes the organism better adapted.** The sequence MDTUIFKQINIOAFERSCL has already 50% of the right letters, or -in the bird example- a beak that is already halfway between the starting point and the ""optimal"" beak length.
In any form implying that any biologist, including prof. Dakwins, would think that all mutations for any given feature all need to be in place before it offers benefits would mean missing the whole basis of evolutionary theory. In fact, as I have shown in my last post, the original function of any feature can completely change, it doesn't even have to be pure improvement of one aspect, it can also shift to something completely different. 

Again, I apologize for this wall of text, but this is a perfect example, where it is quite easy to see that Lennox is demonstrably, objectively wrong about what the analogy represents. One just needs to look at what the Elements in Dawkins analogy represent (as I did further up there), and it becomes obvious that Dr Lennox (and apparently someone called Elliott Sober) fell victim to an interpretation, which Prof Dawkins would probably be the first one to agree is ridiculous. 

At that point I would also like to add that at best, you (or Lennox) could at best make the argument that the analogy is too confusing. Maybe, you could make an argument for that I guess, but none of that would impact the validity of the mechanism that the analogy (attempts to) make clear. Even if we were to agree right now that Dawkins Analogy is not very good for describing adaptation through natural selection, nothing in this entire argument would even address the validity of natural selection.

344,"&gt;Evolution can't make species-level changes.

Demonstrating Species Evolution, Macro Evolution, on Your Kitchen Table

""A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring."" The Biological Species Concept - boundless . com

In 1979 it was discovered that the two sub species plants of the same species Senecio vulgaris and Senecio squalidus could interbreed and produce a hybrid.

Now the hybrid generated by this inter-breeding was given the name Senecio eboracensis. This new plant can breed with itself which means it is a viable hybrid. However, and this is the really important part, it cannot breed with either of its parent plants or any other plants. So this means that the new hybrid must be of a new and different species than its originating plants.

So what we have is two plants interbreeding to create a new never before seen plant species.

Needless to say as these are plants you can of course repeat this on your own kitchen table as often as you want. You know repeatable testable evidence of macro evolution, the evolution of a new species.

&gt; Oddly, Dawkins admits that his analogy is misleading, precisely because cumulative natural selection is ""blind to a goal."" He claims that the programme can be modified to take care of this point – a claim that, not surprisingly, is nowhere substantiated, since it cannot be. Indeed such a claim, even if it were true, would serve to establish the exact opposite of what Dawkins believes, since modifying a programme involves applying yet more intelligence to an intelligently designed artefact – the original programme.

So - while I have no doubt that you would strongly disagree with these statements (which I look forward to discussing further, if you are willing), surely we can agree that there is no misunderstanding on the part of Dr. Lennox as to the point that Dawkins is attempting to make. Stated succinctly: random mutation paired with unguided selection that is blind to a goal results in innovation (i.e. ""fitness"").

Hopefully I do not presume too much, but intuition tells me that you would be reluctant to make a distinction between the concepts of micro-evolution and macro-evolution. Regardless, I'm certain that you are aware that many individuals (rightly or wrongly) do make that distinction. Those who doubt the validity of many aspects of neo-Darwinistic theory typically (from my experience) have no qualms with such moderate adaptations, which they place within the realm of micro-evolution. As a relative layperson in the matter, this notion seems rather obvious and intuitive to me. Organisms can adapt to their environments - certainly.

In order to appreciate the full critique that is being made here, you must read further into the text:

&gt; But there are yet more problems with Dawkins’ analogy... The problem here is best illustrated by Elliott Sober’s version of Dawkins’ analogy, in which he imagines a combination lock that can be opened only by the combination METHINKSITISAWEASEL. The combination lock is composed of 19 discs placed side by side, each containing the 26 letters of the alphabet and equipped with a window through which a single letter of the alphabet can be seen. We imagine that the discs are randomly spun and a disc is stopped by some mechanism when the letter in the viewing window matches the target combination. The remaining discs are randomly spun and the process repeated. So the system is essentially that of Dawkins.

He goes on:

&gt; ...the analogy ‘purports to be an analogy for natural selection which requires a function. But what function is there in a lock combination that is wrong? Suppose that, after spinning the discs for a while, we had half the letters right, something like the sequence MDTUIFKQINIOAFERSCL (every other letter is correct). The analogy asserts that this is an improvement over a random string of letters, and that it would somehow help us open the lock…. If your reproductive success depended on opening the lock, you would leave no offspring. Ironically for Sober and Dawkins, a lock combination is a highly specified, irreducibly complex system which beautifully illustrates why, for such systems, function cannot be approached gradually.

So to summarize - it would appear that all reasonably intelligent individuals can agree that - at a bare minimum - random mutation paired with natural selection can account for moderate environmental adaptations. The larger question, as it typically does, hinges largely on the notion of irreducible complexity.

To that point, I'd like to submit for discussion a few additional quotes from noted academics in the field:

&gt; If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. - Charles Darwin

&gt; We have always underestimated cells. The entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines… Why do we call the large protein assemblies that underlie cell function, protein machines? Precisely because, like machines invented by humans to deal efficiently with the macroscopic world, these protein assemblies contain highly co-ordinated moving parts. - Bruce Alberts, President of The National Academy of Sciences

&gt; Molecular evolution is not based on scientific authority. There is no publication in the scientific literature – in prestigious journals, specialty journals, or books – that describes how molecular evolution of any real, complex, biochemical system either did occur, or even might have occurred. There are assertions that such evolution occurred, but absolutely none is supported by pertinent experiments or calculations… despite comparing sequences and mathematical modeling, molecular evolution has never addressed the question of how complex structures came to be. In effect, the theory of Darwinian molecular evolution has not published, and so it should perish. - Michael Behe

&gt; Classical science, with its preferences for reduction to a few controlling factors of causality, was triumphantly successful for relatively simple systems like planetary motion and the periodic table of the elements. But irreducibly complex systems – that is, most of the interesting phenomena of biology, human society and history – cannot be so explained. We need new philosophies and models, and these must come from a union of the humanities and the sciences as traditionally defined. - Stephen Jay Gould

Dr. Lennox also says:

&gt; James Shapiro, a biochemist at the University of Chicago, also admits that there are no detailed Darwinian accounts for the evolution of any fundamental biochemical or cellular system; only a variety of wishful speculations. Even the highly critical review of Behe by Cavalier-Smith concedes Behe’s point that no detailed biochemical models exist.

Of course, Michael Behe is a controversial figure among many circles due to his association with the Intelligent Design movement; however, I do find the criticisms raised by Stephen Jay Gould and Thomas Cavalier Smith to be particularly compelling. I'm interested in your response to the criticisms laid out by Cavalier-Smith regarding the lack of detailed biochemical models (see Trends in Ecology and Evolution article).",1,1479445468,2016-11-18 00:04:28
367,"&gt;Perhaps. 

Definitely. But don't just take my word for it, I'll happily address all your questions, until you see why I can be so certain that this is bunk.

&gt;Please bear with me, as I'm new to this sub and certainly not an expert in this field. That said, I do have some questions regarding your response.

As I said, gladly. You are polite, actually read responses and seem to be ready to accept them.

&gt;Would I be correct in stating that the Weasel program that Richard Dawkins outlines in chapter three of his book The Blind Watchmaker serves as a defining example of the process that you describe?

Hmm, almost. It's not so much a defining example, as it is a fitting analogy. That is an important distinction, I'll come back to that. But apart from that: Yes.

&gt;If a match occurs, that character gets ""locked in place,"" so to speak. If a match has not occurred, the monkey continues typing until one does. The effect in real-world simulations is that a process that would have previously taken a taken a trillion-trillion-trillion attempts now only requires 43.

Yes, that is close enough as a summary of what Dawkins attempted to explain with this analogy.

&gt;Rather than pose my final question to you directly, I should like to present the following quote from Cambridge mathematician John Lennox:
&gt;&gt;Dawkins has solved his problem, only by introducing the two very things he explicitly wishes at all costs to avoid. In his book he tells us that evolution is blind, and without a goal. What, then, does he mean by introducing a target phrase? A target phrase is a precise goal which, according to Dawkins himself, is a profoundly un-Darwinian concept.

Apparently, Mr Lennox has not read the book, or even the entire chapter before writing his critique. It's been quite a while since I read the blind watchmaker, but even I still remember that Dawkins took great pains to make sure his readers understood that an analogy was a useful method of explaining complex phenomena, but they all eventually reach a limit at accurate describing reality. 
As Lennox himself points out, Dawkins explained time and time again that evolution has no goal. And yet, he didn't consider that he might have misunderstood the passage in which Dawkins seemingly sets a goal to be reached?
Let me explain: The problem is that Mr Lennox is looking at the analogy from the wrong end. 

*The ""target phrase"" is simply meant to represent any advantageous attribute(s), either a single feature or an organism as a whole.* What are advantageous attributes? Well, that depends on their environment, both genetic, as well as the literal environment an organism lives in. It's whatever helps them thrive in that environment Each ""correct"" letter is simply a small mutation that makes it a little more likely for the organism to survive and reproduce in the environment. 
What's important to understand that the outcome didn't HAVE to be that one sentence (or to use the real world equivalent, any ONE specific organism). That's the part where Lennox has it the wrong way around. **Instead, what the analogy does, is look at one outcome that has happened, and explain how that outcome is possible entirely by unguided means of small variation (Monkeys randomly hitting keys), acted upon by natural selection (the advantageous traits being kept in place, and the disadvantageous or neutral ones being discarded each round).**

 In order to make my example more clear, imagine, instead of using the analogy, Dawkins had taken a random animal, like a whale. He could have taken any animal, but the point is, it already exists, and it is already very well suited for its environment, both genetic and actual. Now, he explains how an animal like a whale, equipped very well for life in the sea, could evolve from an animal that lived on land, entirely through natural means.  
A whole lot of changes are necessary for that change right? If you take all the changes on a DNA level and assume they happen randomly, the odds of that happening are some insanely small number. BUT: they don't just happen randomly, that's the point he's trying to get across. Or more precisely, they do happen randomly, but it is entirely nonrandom which changes are kept and which are discarded. Again, it is important to note that the outcome never HAD to be a whale. There are several other paths the random mutations might have given an advantage over the ""previous"" or other versions, and we might have ended up with a different organism in the same niche. 
But once we have an organism, we can explain the mechanism by which it naturally arises by a process of random change, acted upon by nonrandom selection. That is what Dawkins did with his analogy. There is nothing circular about it, and it does not require evolution to have a goal. Do you understand that? I'm sorry for writing such a wall of text, but if you understand this point, you can pretty much answer the other two quotes by yourself, they mostly miss the same basic point. I'll just answer some points which I feel are different enough from the one big misunderstanding they all have in common.

&gt;a force that conserves a point or a property because it will be useful. [...]And by what means could future usefulness be transmitted to the present?

Yep, it can't be, and evolution does not require it. A feature could be the most useful feature for any animal to ever have, if there is bridge of small steps, EACH OF THEM ADVANTAGEOUS OVER THE PREVIOUS, it can not happen. What can happen, is change of function over time. The bird wing, for example, started out as a feathered arm, used to more efficiently warm eggs. But those feathered arms also slightly helped when jumping from treebranch to treebranch, and a mutation causing slightly longer or stronger feathers, or slightly lighter bones would have been an advantage, and even slightly longer and slightly differently spaced armfeathers would have been even more of an advantage than that, slowly working it's way to gliding and then flight. At no point in this transition do we need any conscious mind thinking ""gee, flying would be useful, better start working on those wings"". Every step in itself is an advantage(, or at the very least neutral, when there isn't a lot of selective pressure in an environment.)
In fact, entire species have gone extinct, because of the fact that evolution can't plan ahead.

The fact that you even use this term is telling.

&gt;  If Jesus wasn't nailed...

Ah yes, Jesus of Nazareth, the town that didn't exist until over a hundred years after his alleged death...  how's that work again?

&gt; I'm not a fan of fairy tales.

...and yet, you believe things that are objectively false, and dismiss things that are objectively, demonstrably, and verifiably true while demonstrating your ignorance of them by attacking strawmen.

&gt; The theories of evolution are contradictory to the inherent nature of the universe as God created it.

This is not a rebuttal, it is merely an unevidenced assertion.  Again, you are simply assuming your preferred conclusion.

&gt; Check out the 2nd law of thermodynamics for deeper insight.

You're so wrong here on so many levels.  

Firstly, within the context of thermodynamics, the word ""entropy"" has a very specific meaning: the unavailability of a system's energy to do work.  Nothing about randomness, chaos, order, or decay.  Now, there is an entropy term in the field of Information Theory that means randomness, but that term is not interchangeable with the entropy in the thermodynamics context, and Information Theory does not apply to thermodynamics systems.

Secondly, despite your unbacked objection to this point, the 2nd Law is very specific about where it applies: isolated systems.  The earth is not an isolated system as it receives a constant energy input from the sun.  However, even if we considered an isolated sun-earth system, for the sake of argument, we'd still see an increase in entropy due to the overwhelming energy use in the sun due to hydrogen fusing into helium.

Thirdly, well, read up on Illya Prigogine's Nobel Prize winning work on dissipative systems.  I'd offer more explanation here, but your level of comprehension thus far, on every topic we've explored, has been so lacking that it wouldn't be worth my time explaining it until you have a larger foundation of knowledge to build upon.

&gt;  ...it does nothing to discount the natural occurrence and observance of genetic entropy...

As we've been over previously, that's not real.  However, even if I hadn't already demolished this argument of yours weeks ago (that you bring it up again just demonstrates how dishonest you are), it shows further that you have no understanding of that which you speak on because you are attempting to conflate two different, non-interchangeable meanings of the word ""entropy"".

&gt; We will disagree on the mechanisms you use to date the fossils...

Ignoring for a moment your callous disregard for the basic laws of physics in your dismissal of radiometric dating, such dating is irrelevant here.  The fossils I'm talking about are in stratified order, meaning they are simply sorted with the oldest at the bottom.  Do you disagree that older fossils should be lower as newer fossils pile atop them?  Do you disagree with hydrodynamics?

&gt; ... we will disagree on how the fossils got there...

The organisms died and sank to the bottom of the ocean.  Do you disagree with gravity now?

&gt; ...and we will disagree on what events caused the creation of the fossils.

The organisms themselves create the intricate mineral skeletons that sink to the ocean floor as they die.  Do you disagree with the established fact that these organisms create skeletons?

&gt;  Evolutionists are convinced their existence ends in just a few decades, but to spend those few decades unwaveringly focused on refuting Christians like myself...

Here you've missed the greater point: evolution isn't about you.  It isn't about humans.  It isn't about your mythology.  It is simply an unbiased search for the details explaining extant biodiversity.  The fact that this refutes your unevidenced beliefs is merely coincidental, but the fact that you take it so personally and double down suggests that you already know that you're wrong.  You and your ilk attempt to use the trappings of science to show that you're right, but it's elementary to see that you're doing it backwards, starting with your preferred conclusion and attempting to justify it rather than building towards a conclusion from the evidence alone...  and in doing so, you miss the point of the scientific process as well.  Science isn't something we use just to show that we're right, science is how we *actually become right*.  The only way to improve your understanding of anything is to find errors in your current position and *correct them*, and you cannot do that if you think you're starting from a position purporting to possess ""inerrant knowledge"".  However wrong you are is however wrong you shall forever be.

406,"&gt; It's false.

Perhaps. Please bear with me, as I'm new to this sub and certainly not an expert in this field. That said, I do have some questions regarding your response.

&gt; Evolution is not random. Random mutations are a part of evolution... but they are not the whole process. After the diversity is introduced... natural selection acts on it and selects in a nonrandom way which mutations will be passed on to future generations... You don't have to roll a thousand dice and get a thousand sixes at once, you can roll the dice, keep any sixes that come up, and reroll the rest.

Would I be correct in stating that the [Weasel program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program) that Richard Dawkins outlines in chapter three of his book _The Blind Watchmaker_ serves as a defining example of the process that you describe? For readers who are unfamiliar with the example Dawkins outlines (likely not many), allow me to summarize:

- A random sentence from _Hamlet_ is chosen: ""Methinks it is like a weasel""
- 28 imaginary monkeys (one for each character in the target sequence) is placed in front of a typewriter.
- For any given round in which each monkey presses a random key, the odds of the target sentence being correctly spelled out is calculated to be 1 in 10^40 (or one in a trillion-trillion-trillion).

Furthermore, Dawkins proposes that the odds of producing the target sentence can be drastically reduced if each time a monkey presses a key, the chosen character is compared with the target character at the corresponding position in the target sentence. If a match occurs, that character gets ""locked in place,"" so to speak. If a match has not occurred, the monkey continues typing until one does. The effect in real-world simulations is that a process that would have previously taken a taken a trillion-trillion-trillion attempts now only requires 43.

Have I described this process adequately thus far? I believe this is the heart of Dawkins' argument... the claim that a blind, mindless, unguided process has the power to produce biological information.

Rather than pose my final question to you directly, I should like to present the following quote from Cambridge mathematician John Lennox:

&gt; Dawkins has solved his problem, only by introducing the two very things he explicitly wishes at all costs to avoid. In his book he tells us that evolution is blind, and without a goal. What, then, does he mean by introducing a target phrase? A target phrase is a precise goal which, according to Dawkins himself, is a profoundly un-Darwinian concept. And how could blind evolution not only see that target, but also compare an attempt with it, in order to select it, if it is nearer than the previous one? Dawkins tells us that evolution is mindless. What, then, does he mean by introducing two mechanisms, each of which bears every evidence of the input of an intelligent mind – a mechanism that compares each attempt with the target phrase, and a mechanism which preserves a successful attempt? And, strangest of all, the very information that the mechanisms are supposed to produce is apparently already contained somewhere within the organism, whose genesis he claims to be simulating by his process. The argument is entirely circular.

A supporting criticism from mathematician David Berlinski (Columbia, Stanford, Rutgers):

&gt; The Darwinian mechanism neither anticipates nor remembers. It gives no directions and makes no choices. What is unacceptable in evolutionary theory, what is strictly forbidden, is the appearance of a force with the power to survey time, a force that conserves a point or a property because it will be useful. Such a force is no longer Darwinian. How would a blind force know such a thing? And by what means could future usefulness be transmitted to the present?

And finally, the following statement from Dr. Lennox:

&gt; It should also be noted in passing that the fact that a correctly typed key is retained, never to be lost again, is equivalent to making the assumption that advantageous mutations are always preserved in the population. But, as evolutionary biologist [Sir Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) showed in his foundational work, this is not the case in nature. Most beneficial mutations get wiped out by random effects, or by the likely much larger number of deleterious mutations. This contradicts the idea commonly held since Darwin, that natural selection would preserve the slightest beneficial variation until it took over the population.

415,"&gt; So far I'm hearing ""This layer corresponds to this era, this layer to this era, etc.""

Ah. [I only skimmed it, but this seems like a good source](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens1110/geotime.htm) on how the various geological strata are dated.

&gt;I know that sometimes fossils are found ""out of place""

It's rare, but it does happen.  Generally speaking, when we find something of that nature it's explainable in a few different ways:  some sort of geological upheaval, subduction or other tectonic activity, or (most exciting of all) we have to change our understanding of a species' lifetime.  None of these ""out of place"" fossils are ever *ignored*, mind you - if something like that is found, we have to know *why* it's there, so we look for evidence that would tell us why it is where we found it.

&gt;Plus, there hasn't been much talk about what the layers themselves are made of (slate, limestone, etc) and how or why those layers were formed.

The source I linked above goes in to this a little bit.  If you want more detail, I'll see what I can find for you.

&gt;It seems weird to me that the layers have these almost clear lines where something was deposited on top of another.

You need to look bigger picture, my friend, and the best way to start is to learn how the various sorts of rocks are formed.  FOR EXAMPLE, [limestone is formed under water](https://www.irvmat.com/kids/whatIsLimestone.htm) by the compression of lots of calcium carbonate:  basically, seashell material.  Basalt, by comparison, is formed by volcanic activity, and Marble is formed when limestone is exposed to high temperatures and pressures.  Learning these things can tell you the sorts of changes that happened in the past that caused the various layers to form.

&gt;hat points to instantaneous disasters, not slow steady layers being built up.

Not really - you have to keep in mind that these layers are subject to ENORMOUS pressure from above as time goes on, and thus they will compact, and variations will even out.  Sometimes it is, in fact, an instantaneous disaster (sudden inland seas, for example, or volcanic explosions - even meteorite hits like the one that formed the [K-T boundary](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/education/events/cowen1b.html))

&gt;There also seems to be a lack of complete layer records. Aside from the one linked in this post, the layers appear randomly all over the world, and then they are pieced together.

Part of the problem is that all the continents aren't where they are now, and what used to be above ground a billion years ago might very well now be under the ocean, or vice versa.  Couple that with various local changes (local floods, local subduction) and it gets really complicated REALLY quickly.  A universal guide like what you're talking about would be a monumental task, and it's one that just hasn't been done to my knowledge.

HELLO?

&gt;Also, does a gene duplication not satisfy your conditions? Gene A duplicates, one copy changes, now you have Gene A1 and Gene A2, each with their own function. The genome has increased in size, and a new functional gene has been acquired. We see this with the globin family of genes (myoglobin, alpha and beta hemoglobin), with opsins (R-opsins and C-opsins) in animal eyes, and on the large scale with Hox genes in bilateria, to name three examples of this mechanism.

Sure, if you can prove the genome was actually duplicated and not designed that way. Any time we see this in current biology it is invariably detrimental (I am specifically considering Down's syndrome, but there are others).

&gt;Or does the new information have to come from another source? That seems like an unnecessary requirement, but okay, we can go with horizontal gene transfer. That's how most bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance. Plasmids or viruses carrying the resistance genes move them between individual cells (or they can be directly transmitted via conjugation), and then those genes can be integrated into the bacterial chromosome.

This is cool, but seems limited to ""simpler"" life forms. And the question still beckons, ""From where did the information arise?""

484,"&gt;&gt;Junk DNA

&gt;Most of the genome is transposable elements or integrated viruses. Those sequences are often transcribed. The question isn't activity , it's function , and nobody's providing evidence of selection, which is what you would see if they were functional . For example, a dN/dS ratio significantly different from 1 would be evidence of selection. 

&gt;Not that you would know, but we've been through this so many times here in the last couple of months. But the argument is the same. ""It does stuff."" ""Well we'd expect it to do stuff, but it's not selected to do stuff, therefore it's not functional."" And that's the end. Nobody has yet responded to that point. SINEs and LINEs, ERVs, whatever. You need evidence of selection to conclude function. 

But there is mounting evidence of function, which, per the prediction, will continue to grow until there is little or nothing left.

http://m.rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/03/11/rna.2658311.abstract

“Many noncoding RNAs, both long and short, have been shown to regulate a variety of processes in cells. The noncoding RNAs produced from some pseudogenes also appear to use a variety of fascinating mechanisms to control gene function.”

&gt;&gt;Amylase copies

This was, admittedly, my weakest argument. I should have returned to this and cleaned it up or erased it but didn't take time after getting into the other subjects.

&gt;In the LTEE, for example, the first two mutations occurred thousands of generations before the one that permitted aerobic citrate metabolism. All three were required. **If they were induced purposefully, they would have happened sooner, and in the other eleven lines.** The long time between individual mutations, and the fact that they only appeared in one out of twelve lines is strong evidence that they were random, not directed. 

To clarify. 

""*Forty-six* independent E. coli Cit+ mutants were isolated from all E. coli derivatives except the E. coli ΔcitT::kan mutant. Potentiation/actualization mutations occurred *within as few as 12 generations*, and refinement mutations occurred within 100 generations.""

""Importantly, these experiments negate Gould's theory of contingency, i.e., the idea that if evolution were replayed, different outcomes would arise.""

""A simple model emerges that explains the Cit+ mutants derived either by direct selection or by LTEE. Cells are potentiated by citT amplification (&gt;4×) and actualized by subsequent chromosome remodeling to capture a promoter that allows aerobic citT expression. **The number of copies of citT required for growth before this capture is high but afterwards is decreased (2×) to reduce the fitness cost of maintaining numerous citT gene copies.**""

""Interestingly, our findings parallel the conclusions from bacterial starvation studies by Zinser and Kolter (44) in which E. coli adaptations were dominated by changes in the *regulation of preexisting gene activities rather than by the generation of new gene activities*, de novo.""

""**A more accurate, albeit controversial, interpretation of the LTEE is that E. coli's capacity to evolve is more limited than currently assumed.**""1111

&gt;I will note that there are organisms that have mechanisms to increase the mutation rate in response to adverse conditions. Some bacteria have a mechanism  that triggers error-prone DNA replication. Some parasites can increase the mutation rate for certain genes that interact with the host immune system, in order to better evade it. But in all of these cases, the mutation rate is increased; mutations are still random. No specific mutations are triggered. 

And yet no speciation occurs during this process? This would seem the ideal conditions to observe one. Could it be that, like the E. Coli, there is a limitation to the degree of mutation the organism can survive? 

&gt;&gt;Any simulation that authentically portrays the conditions of genetic drift, mutation, adaptation, etc. will never develop a speciation event.

&gt;This is neither true (I've used them, years ago as an undergrad, in a genomics class. You could mess with the importance of each variable and see what happens) nor relevant, Examples? Hybrid plant species. 

Hybrids are a potential exception, but still based upon existing genetic code. This is a new species, but not in the same category as change in complexity required to explain the difference between man and whatever supposed primate allegedly served as the progenitor for all existing primates. Additionally, if you  didn't delve into the program code, could you be certain it wasn't biased towards intelligent additions? Do you remember the name of the one you used?

&gt;since we've observed speciation events in nature. 

&gt; HIV in the 20th century. Lake Victoria cichlids, over 500 species in the last ten to fifteen thousand years. 

I am very sceptical of this statement. What I have gathered is that we have observed adaptation to the environment, which may lead to behavioral separation (not being *willing* to interbreed, as opposed to able), but no clear-cut speciation. I see no definitive proof the cichlids are not still the same species, and, as a side note, how do we have examples of this species that are native to north and south America?


&gt;&gt;What selection pressure would lead to development of two entirely separate means to repair DNA?

&gt;One mechanism, one mutation and you're dead. Two mechanisms and you can survive one mutation. 

But the species certainly isn't dead, so there should not be selection pressure for additional mechanisms. It made sense to say multiple *copies* of the same RNA sequence allows a greater expression (more RNA able to be created simultaneously), but this still indicative of a design feature as easily as random mutation.
 

&gt;Genomics stuff in your first post.

&gt;You're not interpreting these finding correctly. At all. For example, the mitochondrial DNA in birds. That paper is about the order of the genes in the chromosome. We know mechanisms that can cause that in bacteria (mitochondria are derived from alpha-proteobacteria), and that paper is using the reordering events to develop a phylogeny for birds and reptiles. This paper isn't refuting the idea of common ancestry; it's using a specific data set to determine evolutionary relationships. 

&gt;it's using a specific data set to determine evolutionary relationships. 

So, the germ cell mitochondrial DNA was altered separately or sourced from different species than the nuclear DNA? And, if so, how was this accomplished *after* the mitochondria supposedly became integrated into the host cell?

&gt;Take as another example the paper that you quoted (""Thus, in two-thirds...""). This is not a new finding. We've known for as long as we've been doing genomics that ""species tree"" and ""gene trees"" (phylogenies for specific genes) can vary, because the gene trees will converge at gene duplication events, rather than speciation events. We see this all the time . It's evidence for common ancestry. Common ancestry is such a robust principle that not only can we look at genomes as a whole, but we can trace specific genes back hundreds of millions of years to common ancestor genes. Some other examples are the globin family of proteins, which include hemoglobin and myoglobin, and the opsins that are responsible for detecting light in our eyes. 

And yet there have to be endless pleadings for convergent evolution to explain systems, processes, and/or organs that **don't** result from common ancestry. Mammalian placenta being a prime example. 

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1626/20120507.long

""Altogether, these studies provide clear evidence that a number of retroviral env genes have been independently co-opted on multiple occasions in the course of mammalian evolution (figure 5) and may have thus repeatedly prompted the emergence of a syncytial maternal–fetal interface, exemplifying a remarkable phenomenon of evolutionary convergence. Interestingly, comparative anatomy reveals that the placenta is the most variable organ among mammalian species.""

""These genes of exogenous origin and acquired ‘by chance’ raise a paradox, as they are ‘necessary’ to carry out a basic function common to placental mammals, and yet they appear to have been acquired lately.""

So they have to make up a story of all of them having an ancestral version that got co-opted by newer versions. Problem on top of problem, they are often located in disparate portions of the genome. Yet they **all** had the ancestral version replaced? To reply in kind, ""Really?""

&gt;So I appreciate that you took all the time to find these sources and make a case based on actual evidence, but you're either misunderstanding the biological processes at play, or misinterpreting the findings of the papers. 

Or, and if you consider this it might truly blow your mind, these genome are *relatively* unchanged, and the viruses originated **from them**, with subsequent mutation blurring the similarities. So interpretation is key, but you haven't provided any indication that most of my predictions are based on poor exegesis. 

""However, in some mammalian species, fully functional proviruses persist. Such ‘young’ ERVs can be reactivated to produce infectious virions that are transmitted horizontally and can even reinfect the germline to form proviruses that can become fixed as new ERVs at novel positions in the host genome. This is notably the case for the mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) and the mouse mammary tumor viruses [21], the endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs) [22] and the more recently identified koala retrovirus (KoRV) [23].""",1,1479183512,2016-11-14 23:18:32

486,"Lots of good answers but I'll add my 2c.  The key is to distinguish random mutations from non-random natural selection.

Take for example the problem of climbing a hill (the fitness hill, or Dawkins' ""Mount Improbable"").  Randomness alone would not get you to the top of the hill. But randomness in combination with survival of the fittest does.  (Sidebar definition: fitness = ability to reproduce and carry on genes.)

This process can be demonstrated beautifully with simulation, and is the basis for an optimization method called Genetic Algorithm (GA).  GAs are used to solve difficult and complex problems that would never be solved by ""brute force"" random trial and error.  But the combination of random ""mutations"", most are deleterious or neutral, some are beneficial, and ""natural selection"" of the fittest solutions, works really really well.

Probabilities expressed as ""a chance of x in y"" (in this case, 1 in 4^300) are a way of expressing the likelihood/chance of a specific outcome being observed during a specific kind of random experiment.

For example, the probability of rolling a fair die and getting a 1 is said to be ""1 in 6"" because there are exactly 6 possible events (one for each face of the die), each of those events are equally probable (because it's assumed to be a fair die) and each of those events are independent of each other (because rolling a 5 on your first roll does not affect the outcome of the 2nd roll).

It is not possible to know what all possible outcomes of all possible random events in the history of evolution could have been, and therefore someone just pulled those numbers out of thin air; and even if that were possible, it is *not* the case that those events were independent.

Random mutations ARE a part of evolution, they introduce diversity.

493,"No. Source: The number itself is made up, and you would be hardpressed to find a website that went as far as to actually demonstrate it.

I don't get to pull false statistics out of my ass just because I feel like it. And just because I claimed it doesn't mean that everyone else is required to disprove it; I should justify it first. Which hasn't been done for that bullshit number.",11,1479172898,2016-11-14 20:21:38
494,Saying that mutations are almost akways lethal is laughable and sharing an article with a lhrase like that shows your understanding of biology to be close to nil. ,1,1479163473,2016-11-14 17:44:33
495,I think a good idea would be to try and look among other organisms for similar events and to find out what the proposed explanation for it is. I think the loss explanation for this portion is probably a realistic explanation but that's what I would go about doing.,2,1479124533,2016-11-14 06:55:33
496,"Or it could be that block of information moved to another location somewhere in the genome. That would still count as a noticeable difference but it's not as bad sounding as having lost it entirely. For some reason a large deletion only seems like a bad replication related accident that did not do chimps too much more harm.

497,The chimps are the ones that lost it and the bonobos are the ones that kept it. It just seems like a glass half-empty/half-full situation to prioritize either one as being more important to this discussion.,3,1479096111,2016-11-13 23:01:51
498,"Yes it's possible that chimps lost it, but in this case it would be all at once loss of large blocks of information. A large stretch of DNA would have had to vanish without a trace of it ever having been there. It's possible that this can happen during replication into gametes. In either event it left chimps without what humans and bonobos still have, which only puts chimps further out on a limb of their own. They would then seem to be a better example of what happens when things go horribly wrong by having large well banded chinks of their genome suddenly deleted.

499,"From the patchwork it does look like a mix and match from earlier existing diversity. What now has me curious is how relatively large blocks of information were exchanged. This can indicate that each block is a subunit that tends to stay together during chromosome exchange. There is then one or the other, not a blending of two.  

The only early homo genetic marker I see is the fusion that makes it necessary to align a Chr2A and Chr2B to our human Chr2. And it's not because of adding more work to the software, it's from reproductive isolation being almost expected from this much nuclear change. There might also be a ""two heads are better than one"" effect that at the genetic level causes chromosomes to get hitched to each other this way. After that both are more than they could be on their own, out in the chromosome territories where it's easy to lose connection with each other. The fusion event could have connected together two separate complex brains (of sorts) that were all of a sudden capable of new tricks, not possible without it.
