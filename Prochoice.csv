4,Today's the Black Friday!,8,True,"If you've seen [the post I've written recently]
 (https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/7u3zkf/the_black_protests_in_poland/) , then you know what's going on in Poland. Radical abortion bans, protests, petitions... One of them passed. The *bad* one. The radical abortion limit. And now it's almost there, close to be implemented...

So the feminists and the pro-choice in general are protesting like they did in 2016, '17, and in January this year.

They are rallying in the city streets against the repressive ban, today, right now, as I'm writing!

I'm watching the Warsaw livestream on Facebook and wearing black clothes as a sign of solidarity with them right now.

Couldn't come to the protest but still trying to show my support...",1521821586,2,2018-03-23 12:13:06
7,I asked a Pro-Lifer if they would support a gun ban if it was to save the lives of children,3,True,"Here's how the conversation went down:

""Why do you want the black market to provide abortion care in this country?﻿""

Her:
""It will be extremely painful... for you. Their punishment must be more severe.﻿""

Me:

""Yea, so then why does Mexico which has abortion banned average 34 abortions per 1,000 pregnancies, while the US which has legalized abortion, only has 13 abortions per 1,000 pregnancies?

You care deeply about the lives of children. You're a very empathetic person in that sense. That's good. *Would you be willing to pass gun bans if it were to save the lives of children as well?*﻿""

Her:
""Banning guns would actually make kids less safe, because then only criminals would have them. Banning abortions, even partially, would save lives. *Bans are for violence, guns are not violence, they are tools.* Killing an unborn human without the ability to speak for itself is an unspeakable act of violence. Your argument is total garbage.﻿""

Me: ""Yea, well Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada don't seem to have the same problem with school shootings that our country does. So clearly they're doing something right, and we're doing something wrong.

"" Bans are for violence, guns are not violence, they are tools."" Lol what? Yea, they're tools for killing. That's why every infantry soldier is equipped with one when they enter a war zone. 

Banning abortion would make women less safe. We already have the highest maternal death rate in the developed world. The ultimate goal of the Pro-Life community is to make that even worse, since they'll be turning over women's abortion care to the black market, instead of it being performed by licensed medical doctors.

If you can claim gun bans don't work, then it's not hard to see that neither would abortion bans.﻿""",1521738905,22,2018-03-22 13:15:05
10,Pro-Lifer With a Question,2,True,"All cards on the table, I’m not expecting to change your minds about this.  On the flip side, I doubt that you will change my mind.  That being said, I’m genuinely curious about your ideas and arguments, even if I don’t agree.  


So, here goes.  


On the pro-life side, abortion discussion revolves a lot around when a fetus becomes human.  I get the impression that on the pro-choice side the discussion tends to focus more on the social ramifications of unplanned pregnancy.  Some very important points need to be made about social ramifications, but since I come from “the other side” I was hoping I could get a pro-choice perspective on the human life question.  
I know there’s a spectrum of ideas out there about when a fetus becomes human and gains human rights.  At the moment the legal landscape tends to grant human rights at either “viability” or birth.  However, the time of birth and the point of viability vary from fetus to fetus depending on external factors like the health of the mother and the technology level of the society.  In other words, weather or not a fetus is legally human depends on where and when it is, not what it is.  Is a late term fetus more human today because we have the technology to save it than the same fetus would have been in antiquity?  More broadly, what should be the legal foundation for granting human rights?    


This seems like a key point to me, but obviously you guys have a different perspective, so let me know how you see this question.  ",1521675496,139,2018-03-21 19:38:16

20,Help me refine my abortion position,0,True,"Hi all,

I currently believe the following:

-Abortion is killing a life
-Life starts with the first heartbeat 
-that life has rights (some)
-Abortion should be legal early in the pregnancy in cases of incest or medical issues with the baby (what medical issues?  Downs maybe?)
-abortion should be legal when the mother is in danger but if the baby is viable, all attempts should me made to save it

I’m really not looking for a fight.  I just need to bounce ideas off of people to triangulate to my position.

Edit: getting a lot of questions about why I consider life beginning at the heartbeat.  Technically I would say life begins at conception.  But i feel like you can’t really kill anything without a beating heart, it’s not alive yet.  It’s not scientific, it’s just how I feel...and that’s why I’m here, to flesh out my thoughts

The moral permissibility of abortion is frequently argued for on these grounds. Increasingly it is being argued that such accounts also entail the permissibility of infanticide, with several proponents of these theories accepting this consequence. 

However, these accounts imply the permissibility of even more unpalatable acts than infanticide performed on infants: organ harvesting, live experimentation, sexual interference, and discriminatory killing. The stronger intuitions against the permissibility of these ‘pre-personal acts’ allow us to re-establish a comprehensive and persuasive reductio against psychological accounts of persons.

63,About Crisis Pregnancy Centers,12,True,"Hello!  I'm posting a slightly modified version of [a post I made](https://np.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/81s3tm/attn_mods_should_information_about_crisis/) over at r/childfree about crisis pregnancy centers.  It was suggested that the information could be useful here as well, and might be worth adding to this sub's wiki. 

There was a recent post on r/childfree about [a vandalized crisis pregnancy center](https://np.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/81ljbx/crisis_pregnancy_center_pretending_to_be_abortion/), and I noticed a few users mentioning that they didn't know that the so-called ""women's/pregnancy  crisis centers"" in the USA and Canada existed.  They weren't aware that these centers work to lure in vulnerable women in order to pressure them to carry their pregnancies to term, instead of getting an abortion.

So I put together the following information and links about CPCs to help readers start learning. All of the info below is accurate and factual to the best of my knowledge:

1. **Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) are anti-abortion organizations that frequently masquerade as reproductive health clinics in order to lure pregnant women away from clinics that will provide them the option of reliable birth control and of safe and legal abortion.**  They aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions’ in order [to fulfill their goal of ‘interfer[ing] with women’s ability to be fully informed and exercise their reproductive rights.’”](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-1140-op-bel-9th-cir.pdf)
1.  Despite what they imply in their names, advertising, and other branding, **most crisis pregnancy centers are NOT medical facilities of any sort.** Apart from providing free pregnancy tests and possibly limited sonograms, they do not offer medical assistance.
1. Most of the time, **CPCs are affiliated with anti-abortion groups run by intensely conservative religious denominations.**  These include, but aren't limited to,  [Birthright International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthright_International) and [Care Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Net).  These are groups committed to making sure you don't have an abortion, regardless of your circumstances.
1.  **CPCs insinuate heavily that they will help you get an abortion** if you desire, or will provide significant financial assistance if you want to carry to term. 
1. **In fact, these centers will pressure you to carry your pregnancy to term, even if you clearly express that you don't want to.**  The assistance they claim to offer is usually limited to a few months of things like diapers and formula.
1. **CPCs use heavy-handed and unethical tactics, including *lots* of emotional manipulation (shaming, guilting, etc.),  giving women incorrect, incomplete, or flat-out deceptive medical information (popularly  known as **LIES**), and tricking or otherwise preventing you from leaving the clinic until you make certain commitments.**  If you go to one, you may be forced to watch anti-abortion films, slide shows, photographs, and hear biased lectures
1. **CPCs work very hard to intercept you from going to a legitimate women's health center.  They use branding to make it sound like they offer abortions, birth control, and have qualified medical professionals on staff (they almost always don't).**  They offer free pregnancy testing to draw you in, so they can start exerting pressure.  They locate themselves next door or near to legitimate centers, they advertise where legitimate centers advertise, and they will list themselves under “abortion” in online directories and search results.
1. **If a CPC gets your personal information, [they may attempt to manipulate or harass you after you leave](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a43101/pregnancy-centers-august-2015/).**  There have been anecdotal reports of women receiving mailings and phone calls encouraging them not to have an abortion, or just discussing their pregnancy.  This is especially problematic for women who don't want their pregnancy revealed to certain people they may be living with.  Many CPCs convince women to sign a contract that they will carry their pregnancy to term, and then send it—with all of their personal information, including social security number—to every abortion provider nearby to try to scare both patients and real health care providers into refusing women care.
1. It's also worth noting that **some (many?) CPC's are fronts for adoption mills.**  Step 1 being to convince the woman to go through with the pregnancy, step 2 to convince her that she's a horrible person and unfit to be a parent so she ought to give up the baby for adoption. See [here](https://www.thenation.com/article/shotgun-adoption/) and [here](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/03/13/undercover-investigation-confirms-california-crisis-pregnancy-centers-lie-women/).  **Sometimes those places will hook you up with free medical care, housing, all kinds of stuff if AND ONLY IF you agree to place your baby for adoption.** There used to be a place in my state that would let mothers stay for six months after the birth of their child if they placed the baby for adoption (for free!) but only three weeks if they chose to parent.  Anyway, some CPCs make quite a bit of money off every woman they convince to both carry the pregnancy to term and give the baby to an adoption agency which charges sky high fees to the adopting parents.
1.  **It can be tough to identify a CPC.**  ""Crisis Pregnancy Center"" is still a fairly common name out there, but these places may also call themselves names such as ""Center for Pregnancy Choices"",  ""(insert religion here) Family Services"",  ""Pregnancy Resource Center"", “A Woman’s Concern Health Centers”, and “Life Choices Medical Clinics” (see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/81s3tm/attn_mods_should_information_about_crisis/dvfupf7/) for sources).  If you're unsure whether or not a given center is a CPC, you can visit [**Expose Fake Clinics**](https://exposefakeclinics.squarespace.com/cpc) to see if they're listed.  At [**SafePlaceProject.com**](https://www.safeplaceproject.com/), you can find legitimate clinics in your area.  And here is [a link to a list of all the Crisis Pregnancy Centres in Canada](http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/CPC-study/list-anti-choice-groups.pdf).


Certainly people with religious convictions who are dealing with an unintended pregnancy may want to consult with a group that shares those same religious convictions.  But those people deserve to know most CPCs will not be able to or willing to provide them the accurate medical information that they need in order to make *any* decisions.

I was about to have an abortion but couldn’t go through with it ... I let my emotions get the best of me.   I was in the waiting room in the back sobbing and crying , wondering how I could terminate this little soul. 

I told my parents and they said they would support me but I live with my evil sister who enjoys torturing me.

The father is an alcoholic who was abusive towards me and told me immediately to get an abortion.


I don’t have a job ... no savings.  


Previous history of mental illness as far as emotional and social problems.

I feel like I should go through with the abortion because at the end of the day it’s my responsibility alone and I just don’t feel ready even though it tears me apart inside, and I’ve told some family members.  I live at home and I suppose I could fake a miscarriage ....
The father already had a child who is barely one years old and doesn’t care ... I’d be baby mama 2.

I have a college degree in Psychology from William and Mary....

I know I have potential but right now I am extremely sad and don’t know what to do... my parents immediately expressed relief at me not being a murderer ....

They are extremely conservative .


What do I do?


Deep down I think it’s foolish to  have a child with no real partner and no career .  My parents are in their mid sixties and I’m one of four kids in a highly enmeshed family.


My evil older sister who is 36 and still lives at home but is a filmmaker who travels around a lot is a huge thorn in my side.

I would feel so much happier knowing I got a way from everyone like that ... if I stayed I would have to deal with her brutal judgement all the time.


She insults me in passive aggressive ways but then acts nice to me in front of parents, she is the golden child while I’m the black sheep.  


I can’t do this but I’m also afraid of always wondering “what if” and the guilt is killing me.


I just don’t feel strong enough

My depression is so bad that I have barely gotten out of bed in two months after the baby’s father gave me a concussion and humiliated me... we have restraining orders on each other .  It’s ironic he turned out this way because he comes from a good family and his dad is an eye doctor .  So is mine . 


My life feels like a nightmare but everyone around me seems to think this child will be a joy, which I’m sure of.


I don’t feel mature at 27 to do this but I also feel maybe having a child could be my saving grace , a reason to change and live .  I’m so so heartbroken,

There will always be accidental pregnancies and legit reasons for late-term and regular abortions(Rape, incest, etc). I get that. There will always be babies who were simply 'meat to be born' IMO(not religious, I also think that babies who were miscarriages, might have been the next Hitler, who knows?) But it shouldn't take you months on end, after you've figured out you're pregnant, to decide whether you want the baby or not.

Also, enough people don't even realize they're pregnant, that they made a show about it.

I am fine with abortion, I just think it should be done as soon as it's found out. 

To people who say men should be the ones to prevent pregnancy-it takes two people(Excluding anomalies) to get pregnant.

91,Question about abortion during custody litigation.,0,True,"So I’m watching Grey’s Anatomy and there’s a conflict in the show that seems like it could be a real life problem for some people, though of course this specific example is fictional. 

So April finds out she’s pregnant the morning before she finalizes a divorce with Jackson. Jackson doesn’t find out about the pregnancy until a couple months later. When he finds out, he sues April and can fight for full custody of the child since April kept this knowledge from him before the divorce. I found this interesting because the court could award Jackson full custody of the child before it’s even born, but April could legally abort the child if she doesn’t want Jackson to have the child. This raises a lot of questions for the pro-choice side (I’m pro-life, please don’t hate me lol). How can a court award full custody of a child that may not even be born at the will of the mother? How could a court take away a child from a healthy (not crazy, addicted, in legal trouble, etc.)  mother immediately after going through a nine month pregnancy? And there are many other questions I’m sure that could be raised, which I’d love to hear in the comments. I’d like to hear many opinions from the pro-choice point of view. 

Also, I’m no lawyer, so I could be completely misunderstanding the legal process here, or it may be much simpler than I think. ",1519886372,3,2018-03-01 01:39:32

96,My argument for the morality of abortion,7,True,"Empathy, and, by extension, moral restrictions(including murder) only apply to beings which display the following characteristics:

1. Consciousness (of objects and events external and/or internal to the being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain;

2. Reasoning (the developed capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems);

3. Self-motivated activity (activity which is relatively independent of genetic or direct external control).

4. The capacity to communicate, messages of with an indefinite number of possible contents on indefinitely many possible topics.

5. The presence of self-concepts and self-awareness.

Within the womb, humans do not fit this criteria. Thus, the act itself is not inherently immoral for its direct malice. Instead, it can be argued that abortions are immoral due to their effects on the potential future. A life is ended before it starts.

However, by this train of thought, the act of refraining from sex or using a condom could be seen as immoral, because it could have led to the creation of a sentient being. So if you turn down unprotected sex, you are in effect “killing” a person that would have otherwise existed in the same way an abortion does.

If the creation of life was always a top priority, then wouldn’t it be moral to rape as many people as possible to produce the most children? In fact, by not having sex all the time you are denying life to potential people. Morally you would be responsible for donating eggs/sperm to be fertilized.

With these examples, it is evident that preventing a sentient being from being created is NOT immoral. Any moral arguments that don’t deal with sentient, thinking beings, are null because morality derives its meaning from the interaction between sentient beings. This is why it IS moral to kill certain insects but not to kill intelligent mammals. Humans don’t have an innate moral ability due to their DNA. Rather, post-natal humans are sentient, thinking, intelligent beings, and therefore must be empathized with.

Any possible counterarguments(or flaws in my argument) that pro-lifers often claim and how you refute them would be extremely welcome.

This being a Pro-Choice Subreddit, leads me to assume that the majority of us are liberals/democrats, (if I am wrong, please correct me) due to them being the only option when it comes to supporting legalized abortion. 

However, I recently stumbled upon this article discussing the emergence of the Pro-Life Democrats.

https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/25/lipinski-democrats-abortion-chicago-illinois-423431?cmpid=sf

My questions to all of you. 

Should we attempt to compromise with Pro-Life Democrats? If so, what would this look like?

Do they have a room in the Democratic Party? Or is reproductive rights one of the key tenants of the party we can't compromise on.

How would any of these choices affect voting demographics and outcomes for the future?

I look forward to your responses.

3. Ivanka Trump was also pro-choice.

4. For all the Christians and Catholics here. Donald Trump says he doesn't need forgiveness from God. Quote: ""I Think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture. I don't."" For the Catholics supporting Trump, think about that when you are at the valid sacrament of confession. http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-on-god-i-dont-like-to-have-to-ask-for-forgiveness-2016-1

I've been getting into some heated discussions with a friend of mine who is firmly in the pro-life camp.
She might not be all the way into the loony bin side of things, for instance personhood doesn't begin at conception as far as she is concerned; but in the interest of ""caution"" since no one can agree when personhood does begin, its best not to risk it and just ban abortion.

She seems to rely quite heavily on the argument of ""if someone gets pregnant, they knew the risks and shouldn't have engaged in that behavior"" which as far as I know is classic ""anti-sex"" rhetoric.
However she does make exception for life of the woman and rape (probably), but NOT for contraceptive failure (them's the risks).

Also she doesn't subscribe to women's bodily autonomy argument at all.

Suffice to say, I don't think I as a man am the most effective person to argue in favor of a pro-choice position.
I was hoping some of you might have some suggestions for various blogs, articles, editorials that would be helpful in at least getting her to understand the other side at least a little.

140,The Black Protests in Poland,8,True,"So, I am new to this subreddit, so sorry for my late reaction, but I feel like I have to write something about what's happening in my homeland since late 2016.
As you may know, Poland has already the one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. The cases in which abortion in Poland is legal are, since 1993:

* When the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy
 
* When the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act 

* When the fetus is seriously malformed


It's highly conservative compared to the most of the Western world; In there, abortion is usually legal on request. 
The main cases of such conservatism are:

* The high percentage of Catholics (about 90%, data from the 2011 census), who are usually pro-life

* High influence of the pro-life groups such as the [Ordo Iuris institute](http://www.ordoiuris.pl/en) or the Catholic Church in politics 

* The ruling party- PiS is very conservative and pro-life.

In April 2016, Polish organizations proposed amended legislation to ban abortion in all cases except to save the woman's life.  The bill included penalties to abortion providers with up to five years of imprisonment. It passed and was debated in Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament), beggining 22 September 2016.
The majority of the Sejm was with it. A competing bill proposed abortion law liberalisation, but it was rejected. If the pro-life law would pass, Poland would have the strictest abortion laws in Europe, together with Vatican and Malta! On 22 September 2016 the law was debated in Sejm. On the same day, the Razem party organized a demonstration, named Czarny Protest (The Black Protest), initiated by Małgorzata Adamczyk, who is a member of the party. People protested on the streets of various Polish cities, wearing black clothes. Those who couldn't come took selfies in black clothed and shared them to the social media, under the #czarnyprotest hashtag. On 1 October there was a large protest near the Sejm building. On 3 October many women went on strike. By October 5, politicians started to distance themselves from the abortion ban. And on October 6, lawmakers voted the bill down.
In 2017, the women protested again because of the anniversary, and to promote their bill, Ratujmy Kobiety 2017, which had similar postulates to the former year's project. Meanwhile, the pro-life activists created a new bill that restricted abortion. It got signed by 830K people and got to the Sejm at January 10. It didn't get rejected this time, even though there were protests against it. I hope that my article was helpful! Sorry for my spelling mistakes.

I think we really need to be careful to not confuse ""life"" and ""personhood."" 
There is no doubt that at conception, a zygote is a life, and it is a human life. This is not arguable. At all. 

The real issue of the abortion debate is personhood. Life and species are biological facts, personhood is a philosophical idea or principal. 
When we deny life at conception, pro lifers think we are denying science, which we kinda are, and so they discredit our arguments. What cannot be determined is if personhood starts at conception, which is the real significant thing. 

So if a pro lifer says ""human life starts at conceptions."" 
You can say ""yes there is life at conception, but you cannot take a dead sperm and a dead egg and make a live zygote. Life is everywhere, we destroy life every time we wash our hands. While I affirm there is life at conception, I do not believe that the life is a person.""

Well, the scientific consensus disagrees. 

Excerpt from Dr. Ricki Lewis, a science writer with a Ph.D. in genetics and biology and author of several textbooks and thousands of articles in scientific, medical, and embryological publications. “Life science textbooks from traditional publishers don’t explicitly state when life begins because that is a question not only of biology, but of philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, technology, and emotions. Rather, textbooks list the characteristics of life, leaving interpretation to the reader.” http://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2013/10/03/when-does-a-human-life-begins-17-timepoints/

Dr. Scott F. Gilbert, a legendary Embryologist from Swarthmore says: As an embryologist and the author of embryological textbooks, I can say with absolute assurance: There is no consensus among embryologists as to when an individual human life begins. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-f-gilbert/countering-republican-claims-embryos_b_8152028.html

Here is an excerpt from a lecture by Dr. Robert Wyman, chair of the Yale Biology department ""There is a lot of false misunderstanding out there, We always hear” It is a scientific fact, as any basic biology text will confirm that life does begin at conception. The fetus is a live human being, distinct from, while dependent on, its mother. It deserves the full protection of its rights."" That's what's common out there. Not only is it what people, most people personally believe, but it's generally considered to be a scientific fact. I've heard this from pro-life people and pro-choice people, almost indistinguishable. The question is--you've all had high school biology at least, how many of you had college biology? A few of you, guess what? That isn't what--that isn't at all what a beginning biology textbook says. What does it say?

192,Activism and spirituality? Looking for personal stories.,5,True,"I am investigating the connection between spirituality and activism. I am interested in how peoples' activism is driven by spiritual or religious beliefs. Of course, I suspect that for many or most political/social justice/climate justice/human rights/animal rights etc. activists, religion and/or spirituality will play no role at all and some may even hate the idea of it. 

But I am interested in whether or not there are those who do feel like their spiritual beliefs guide them to fight for something that has affects more than just their own life. If so, I'd love to hear your personal story or experience with this connection. Does your connection with a higher power (however you define it) guide your activism or play some role in it? If so, please share! Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1514157156,3,2017-12-24 18:12:36

That's all I could gather. Let me know if I am missing anything. It is important that we highlight the ""Pro-Life"" movement's moral bankruptcy in that they literally supported such a dubious person. Along with his sexual misconduct allegations Roy Moore is well known for extremely controversial views and statements. He's made numerous openly homophobic, racist, and misogynistic remarks. He even suggested that every amendment to the Constitution after the 10th was a mistake. This includes amendments abolishing slavery, extending the vote to women, and lowering the voting age to 18. He was removed as a judge multiple times because he placed his interpretation of religious doctrine ahead of interpreting the law, only to be re-elected. He's popular with extremely religious conservatives, which are well represented in Alabama.

Never let the pro-life movement forget about Roy Moore.

Well, just a cursory glance will show that the majority of our country's prestigious, non-partisan and reputable medical organizations have expressed pro-choice positions.

The American Medical Association has also moved away from a strongly pro-life position into an attitude supporting that resolution that abortion is not Murder. In 1859, the AMA said abortion as “the slaughter of countless children, such unwarranted destruction of human life.” Twelve years later, in 1871, the AMA referred to abortion as “the work of destruction, the wholesale destruction of unborn infants.” By 1967, AMA called abortion “the interruption of pregnancy; the induced termination of pregnancy.” By 1970, abortion was simply called “a medical procedure.""

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine represents fertility specialists in the United States and more than 100 other countries. 

The group's spokesman, Sean Tipton, his organization opposed a Mississippi initiative to define Life beginning at conception. Tipton says while a fertilized egg ""is necessary to make a person, fertilization alone is not enough to create a new human being.  ""A fertilized egg has to continue to grow, attach itself to a woman's uterine wall and gestate for nine months before it is born, and there are many potential missteps (that can happen) along the way.""

The group took a similar stand in another situation.  The president of the Washington D.C.-based American Society for Reproductive Medicine took a strong public stand, writing in its February bulletin that the idea life begins at conception is in the same league as ""fake news"" and ""disinformation.""

215,"Out of curiosity, how do pro-choice people view those who are pro-life solely based on religion?",1,True,"I was watching a PBS documentary about women's rights, and in it was a clip of a woman trying to get an abortion in the mid 20th century.  She was being interviewed, and in it she said that she has no hard feelings towards those who reject abortion on a religious basis.

I ask because about a year ago I was in conversation with a strong pro-choice person when it came up that I did not support abortion.  She got extremely upset with me, even though it was for religious reasons.

I can assure you I do not hold my opinion on a basis of trying to feel superior to women by limiting their choice.  I follow the same beliefs of my mother, and her mother, etc.  Do you understand and accept my (and many others') reasons?

I am curious, however, how you guys feel about what freedom of choice the child's mother has versus the father.

Obviously, my view is that both the mother and the father have the responsibility to either put the child up for adoption or raise him/her. However, what happens if the father wants an abortion and the mother doesn't? Now it seems that the father is forced to take care of the child through child support at the minimum, even though the mother was given the option to not have the child at all. Is that fair for the father?

On the flip side, what if the father wants to keep the child, and is willing to fully take care of him/her, but the mother wants an abortion? Personally, if I were to get a woman pregnant and she decided to have an abortion, killing not only her child, but my child as well, that would be devastating.

I know that these scenarios aren't common (particularly the second one), but they do happen. What are your thoughts on them?",1512412138,33,2017-12-04 13:28:58
217,We need to talk about abortion - my experience,19,True,"I recently had a medical abortion at a few weeks pregnant. And now, theres a fire in me, and i want to discuss my experience on the web, and hope that as many people as possible can read this. If it helps one person feel more at ease, then I'm happy. It may be worth noting I am in England, i know methods can vary elsewhere. 

For me, the most difficult aspect was the psychological part, not because I was unsure of my choice, but because of the stigma and the taboo surrounding abortion, the lack of conversation around it, and stepping into the unknown, making me feel like I should feel overwhelmed and scared of what was coming. Having been through it now, I feel an injustice at the way that society - albeit unintentionally- can make someone feel like this. Also, because of the lack of talk, I read quite a few experiences online, which were several years old and didn't then mirror what happened to me, I was wrongly informed and needlessly scared. 
I took a test on a Tuesday which came up positive, and called Marie Stopes immediately, making an appointment for the Friday. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I was at work but emotional and overwhelmed - not much use in the office. My friends were very supportive but my head was everywhere, for reasons mentioned above. 3 days is not very long to wait but I was so nervous it was tough. 
On Friday, I met with nurses, had a scan, (booked an appointment to get a coil fitted a few weeks later) and was asked all the standard medical questions affecting my suitability to the treatment. They made everything seem so much more normal and I felt so much better about everything from then on. The only question I wasn't prepared for was 'why do you want this abortion' which I couldn't really put into words. The nurse helped me word it, and explained it was a legal requirement to answer it. what? Must I justify what I want to do with my body? 
After a 45 minute wait for the application to be signed off by 2 doctors, I took the first tablet (with an anti sickness tablet) and was good to go. I made the follow up appointment for the Sunday. 
On Friday I had some mildish cramps, so I holed up on the sofa with a hot water bottle. nothing I couldn't handle. No painkillers needed. On Saturday I actually went to work for 12 hours. This was a bad idea because I was aware of possible side effects. But because I couldn't get my shift covered, I felt pressured to go in. Luckily, other than the cramps on Friday, I didn't experience any other side effects. No bleeding, nausea, anything. 
I went back to the clinic on Sunday, where I had not even a ten minute wait. took an anti sickness tablet and was given some antibiotics to take after dinner. then I was given 4 tablets to keep against my gums for half an hour. as soon as the tablets were in my mouth I was free to go, and given a 24 hour number to call with any concerns. Having read other reviews online, I thought that i would have to stay there while I passed the pregnancy. I'm much happier I was able to go straight home! 
To sum the sunday up - I had mild to moderate cramps for about 6 hours. I started bleeding an hour after taking the tablets, clots coming out while I was in the bathroom. I had about half an hour of very bad cramps, and after that passed I was convinced it would get worse, I kept thinking 'that can't be it'- it was. I saw the 'sack' come out in one of my clots shortly after.
I understand everyone reacts differently, some worse than others. I think I was lucky to have fairly mild symptoms with few side effects, and I wonder if that's due to how early I found out I was pregnant, and how quickly i managed to get treatment.
The next morning I woke up, and I was surprised. I thought I'd feel guilty, and that it would affect me mentally for a long time. I felt relieved as I know I did the right thing for me. All of that mental anguish for the week seemed almost unnecessary. I didn't feel like a horrible person. I felt normal.
I just think it's such a shame that there isn't enough talk around abortion, and that other people out there are going through what I went through, feeling as though they are doing something which is such an unspeakable rarity. I read in one article that 1 in 3 women in the UK have abortions. I'm not sure whether this is correct, but I think it's time women shared their experiences more openly with one another, to help women in the future to make their decision without having to deal with the emotional baggage of stigmas and taboos.

229,Abortion Restrictions Harm Women and Children,28,True,"States with the greatest restrictions on abortion are the worst for women’s overall health, according to a new study from the Center for Reproductive Rights, Ibis Reproductive Health, Based on the study, the groups found a “consistently negative relationship between a state’s number of abortion restrictions and its performance on indicators of women’s health, children’s health, and social determinants of health.” The study's authors say lawmakers’ insistence that anti-abortion legislation is intended to protect women’s health is fundamentally flawed rhetoric. “With few exceptions, states that have passed multiple policies to restrict abortion have passed fewer evidence-based policies to support women’s and children’s well-being, compared to states with fewer restrictions on abortion,” the study read. “The negative relationship between the number of abortion restrictions and the number of policies that support women’s and children’s well-being was strong enough to be considered statistically significant.” After evaluating all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the groups compared each state’s performance on 76 different health indicators against the prevalence of anti-abortion legislation. The median number of abortion restrictions was 7. Only Vermont placed no restrictions on abortion. Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma had all 14 restrictions identified by the groups. Another eight states – Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina – had 13 abortion-related restrictions. According to the report, of the 24 states with 3 or less restrictive abortion laws in place, 94% performed above the median score for overall well-being. Of the 27 states with 7-14 abortion restrictions in place, only 3 states met the average score for women and children’s overall well-being. Extensive medical, epidemiological, psychological and sociological evidence proves that abortion is safe and effective for women. Research shows that current laws that restrict abortion actually directly adversely impact women's health.
 
Here are some not so fun facts from the study:

*Abortion Restrictions led to an average increase in the poverty rate for women.

*Abortion Restrictions led to such a high increase in the maternal mortality rate, that states like Texas have the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world.

*Abortion Restrictions led to a lower median of reproductive health.

*Abortion Restrictions led to an overall decline in mental well being for women, with women reporting an increase in depression and substance abuse

*Abortion Restrictions as a whole led to an overall decrease in the standard of living for women, as measured by the HDI-Plus index.

*Abortion Restrictions forced a good deal of woman to stay in contact with violent partners.

*Abortion Restrictions were found to not be a deterrent at all for women seeking an abortion.

*Abortion Restrictions led to a decrease in quality of life for women, citing a decrease in emotional well being, as well as the overall decrease in socioeconomic standards.

*Abortion Restrictions led to a significant decrease in positive child development.

*Abortion Restrictions did not discourage women from getting an abortion. The majority of woman that couldn't travel started seeking drugs such as Misoprostol, which has several damaging side effects, as well more dangerous methods such as taking herbs or inflicting abdominal trauma.

So much for being ""Pro Life""....",1511722248,4,2017-11-26 13:50:48
232,"Debunking the ""Fetal Pain at 8-20 weeks"" Argument",24,True,"Hello Everyone. Just wanted to provide the members of this sub with some evidence in case people bring up the whole notion that a Fetus feels pain between 8-20 weeks. 

One of the foremost experts on fetal development the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it considers the case to be closed as to whether a fetus can feel pain at the early stages in development. ""The science shows that based on gestational age, the fetus is not capable of feeling pain until the third trimester,"" said Kate Connors, a spokesperson for ACOG. The third trimester begins at about 27 weeks of pregnancy. (https://www.livescience.com/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html)

This viewpoint is not only backed by major studies, but also by several distinguished medical clinics around the world. Let's explain how this works. A  fetus does not have the necessary developed and/or functioning structural integration of the nervous system to experience awareness or pain until the third trimester. The perception of pain requires an awareness of an unpleasant stimulus — receptors throughout the body must send a signal to the brain, where it can be processed as pain. An important stage of cortical development is the formation of the subplate zone, a prominent, transient layer of the human fetal cerebral wall which develops around 13 weeks and gradually disappears after 32–34 weeks. The subplate is thought to be the main synaptic or neuronal connection zone in the human fetal cortex where incoming fibers from the thalamus, the main sensory (and pain) relay center, and other regions of the cortex gather during the crucial phase of cortical target area selection. The arrival of thalamic fibers and formation of thalamocortical synapses in the newly formed cortex from 24 weeks onwards provides the minimum connection required for cortical processing of sensory events in the body. The completion of major pathways from the periphery to the cortex, at around 24 weeks, does not signal the end of cortical development- it signals the beginning of a further maturation process. As spinothalamic pathways complete their connections with the cortex, they increasingly stimulate the development of intracortical pathways, which is the next major phase of neuronal maturation. The cortex sends connections down to the brainstem and spinal cord while the motor centers of the brain have begun to form connections with the spinal cord and brainstem by 26–28 weeks. When the neuroanatomy of a fetal brain is observed, there is a lack of cortical connections, which (when functioning) allows the sensation of pain to be transmitted by sensory neurons, specifically nociceptors, ascending the spinal pathways to the thalamus before it relays to the cortex. The exact week a fetus feels pain is currently unknown, however, a fetus doesn’t feel pain or recoil in agitation at 12 weeks like the “Silent Scream” propagates, nor does it feel pain at 20 weeks as some lawmakers across the United States claim. Because of the connections between the thalamus and cortex have not formed until between 23-30 weeks gestational age, a fetus does not feel pain until the third trimester (27-40 weeks), which is beyond the 24-week deadline to obtain an abortion.

241,Pro-Life Looking For Open Discourse On The Topic,0,True,"Hello, first I would like to say that I just found this subreddit and I am eager to see what people with a different viewpoint have to say on this issue!

So I believe that abortion, morally speaking, is wrong. My main argument for this is that pregnancies occur because women happened to have been irresponsible and have gotten pregnant. Since avoiding getting pregnant is so easy, why not just avoid getting pregnant as apposed to discarding what is in the woman's uterus? It costs $0 to not have sex and around $5 for condoms. Being on the pill is also an option.

As far as abortions for unwanted pregnancies go, I am completely against them. If you got pregnant, you were irresponsible and should bear the costs of being pregnant.

In dubious cases like rape or broken condoms (Which according to Guttmacher institute account for 1.5% of abortions in America) I am torn for. While I consider that fetus living, I also recognize that this pregnancy was not the woman's responsibility in having at all. The conflict between the mother having nothing to do with getting pregnant and the value of that fetus make it hard for me to come to a clear conclusion. If I dearly had to pick whether or not abortions should be allowed in rape/defective condoms, most likely I would go with prohibiting abortions as life is still life, even if the mother was not responsible for it.

Abortion rights are a huge deal for me... especially when an abortion is needed to save the life or health of the pregnant woman. It would be a huge deal for me if he thinks that I, or any other woman, should have to risk my life for the sake of a foetus. If I found out he was pro-life, I would feel that he did not value me as a person, and just saw me as a vessel that is less important than a foetus.

261,Just looking for thoughts on a line of reasoning that makes sense to me.,2,True,"I empathize with women who choose to abort because I see how hard it must be, though I can never really know myself, being male and unable to become pregnant.

That being said, I try to think of most issues logically when arguing policies and what should and shouldn't be law.  I'm going to disregard religious arguments because religion and government, and thereby law, are separate.

So here's my line of reasoning:  If abortion is supposedly wronging the child because it's denying it life that it deserves, then how is abstinence, contraception, ""pulling out"", or Plan B not the same, for that child's experience?

The egg that is available to be fertilized that month will not be available again, it will disappear after the potential mother in question has a period.  The exact sperm the potential father may stick around a while longer, but the odds that same one would do the fertilization at a different time are almost nil anyway.

In short, if you're choosing to skip having sex, or to put a condom on, you're CHOOSING to not have little Jimmy.  What is the difference TO JIMMY whether he is not conceived, or whether he is aborted.  

There is none, an while I'm not a proponent of extremely late, 23 week abortions or later, I think we have to be realistic about the difference between potential life, and a living breathing person who's right here in front of us all.

TL:DR contraception is the same as abortion to that exact child that was never born.",1510135305,9,2017-11-08 05:01:45
266,"If we talk about our stories, we can end the stigma.",21,True,"
    I was 22 years old when I got the news that rattled my world and ultimately changed the toxic life I was in. 
    I was living with my boyfriend-at-the-time in a small apartment. I was a waitress at a small cafe and let's just say he went from one job to the next. We struggled to pay rent and feed ourselves every month. We struggled financially so much that one morning I awoke to my car being repossesed and towed right out of my driveway. I had to ride my bicycle to work 5 miles everyday because he did not allow me to use his car. 
     Believe it or not, at this time he and I had recently reconciled after a break up where we argued about infidelity and him wanting an open relationship and me wanting to be monogamous. After three months apart he came to me and said he would rather be together exclusively than not at all and I was naive enough to go back. It didn't take very long for me to start thinking I had made a mistake, but at that point I was trapped in this destructive world I had created for myself. 
     In the time we were apart, I was a patient in a high risk phsyc ward. I spent nearly 2 weeks locked away and isolated from society and then nearly 2 months in mandated intensive psychotherapy 5 days a week. I was a very young adult with extreme emotional damage just learning how to get by, recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and fed a buffet of pills (thanks to our broken pharmaceutical industry) in order to try and make the pain go away and feel ""normal"".  Well I took it too far and almost killed myself by taking far too many one night when I felt more hopeless than ever. And After all that, I still went back to him. I needed to feel like I wasn't alone, and I guess he was just as broken as I was. 
      Fast forward to the same day my car was towed away from our apartment, I had a doctors appointment. I had been nauseas and irritated for over a week but kept blaming it on the cocktail of antidepressants and antipsychotic I was taking daily. It was now time to really found out what was causing all the symptoms. He drove and dropped me off at the doctors, went home and waited for my call to come back. 
     I found out that I was nearly 8 weeks pregnant. A rush of emotions flew through me like I had never felt before. Part of me was elated, I've always wanted to have children, but like this? I was 22, actively using drugs, drinking and in an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship with someone who still acted like a kid himself, and with no interest of having one of their own. ""You're ruining my life if you have that thing"" he said to me. ""You're selfish, you're a narcissist."" I could go on, but I'll save you the trouble. 
      I didn't have a long time to decide what to do because of how far along I was when I found out. But experiencing the way my partner reacted to the news finally triggered something in me; that I wanted better, I needed better to have a child brought into this world. And not just for a child but for myself. I was raised without my father in the picture and it brought along a lot of pain early on in life. I knew that if I had this child, I would be alone. They would likely suffer with me. I had no car, little money, no support and no help. Not to mention the risks of pregnancy when drugs and alcohol are involved early on. I felt it would be selfish for me to bring a child into the world with such an unfair start at life.
    I loved that little soul that was part of me don't get me wrong, it's a feeling like no other and I still hope to feel it again someday. But I ended my pregnancy, alone. I cried out in pain. I got violently sick and layed helplessly in my bathtub soaked with my own blood as it passed through me. 
    Then my life went on though, I had another chance at everything but I was still financially tied to the toxic relationship I was in. He had stuck around since I got the abortion but something switched in me now and I resented him more than ever. I couldn't afford our apartment on my own and relied on him for transportation. I knew I wanted out but I had to plan it. I eventually found a room to rent walking distance from my job and was able to leave him for good and little by little, put the broken pieces of my life together. 
    Im now 25, living medication free in a stable environment with a partner that I love and respect. You know what gave me the strength to do it all? That tiny soul who taught me how much better I could do for myself, and I truly believe our time together will come again, and I'll be ready. &lt;3

276,Clarification on Pro Choice: Birth Control,2,True,"I am pro life, I am also a Atheist. I do already believe in sex education instead of abstinance for students and that birth control  is a necessity for the health of a society. 
Having recently become a Atheist i want to reexamine my views of abortion and not rely on faulty facts or thinking that run wild in religious communities. 

This is kinda where things get tricky.
In my view/opinion birth control is a good and healthy option. Except ones the prevent implantation. In my view/opinion life begins at conception and i can not in good conscious take birth control that would stop the process of pregnancy at implantation. After doing research online i found that the pill and others worked very differently than i had been led to believe. That it just stops the eggs from droping from the overies via hormones. But I still found websites that said it prevented implantation. I grant you they were pro life religious  web sites but is there truth to that?. Medical professionals say it doesnt work that way. Its hard to break old habits. So i wanted to ask the you, who accutally have experience with birth control since pro lifers may not have as much experience in general. 

My intent is not to be hostile or argumentative.  I may after further reflections and investigations be willing to change my mind on pro life if i feel compled by my own sensibilities to do so. But as i am just starting i wish to focus on birth control question. I appreciate your time in reading my thoughts and question. And if you choose to respond i appreciate your words and honesty. 
 
Thank you, peace in truth

Response To Comments: 

Some comments had simmilar points and I wanted adress them togeather. I appreciate your time in detailing your views on implantation. The only reason i brought it up was i did not want (if fertilazation happend) the birth control to effect it if at all possible. I know not all pregnancies can come to term. Miscarriages or spotainious abortions do happen (i have had one) and that its no ones fault. If i know i am pregnant or the possibility. I do what i can within my knowledge not to harm my pregnancy out of principle. These are my personal opinions on the matter and I wanted to address the comments or any future comments on this subject. I am not looking for a discussion on weather the fetus is alive or not during implantation. I just want to learn more about birth control and that implantation was a line i did not wish to cross for my own personal views.

Full Disclosure: I’m the host of this podcast, so there is an element of shameless self promotion in this. Having said that, this week’s episode is totally on topic and I thought because so many anti abortion advocates are coming from a religious perspective, a lot of people here might find it interesting to listen to an extended conversation/debate on the topic with zero appeal to a higher power. I'm Pro Choice (I agree with the ""gradualist"" argument) and begin representing that position around the 17:50 mark.

The premise of the podcast is to speak to controversial subjects for half an hour, making the first 15 minutes really softball and the second 15 really contentious. The contentious segment was extended this week because Kelsey wanted to talk about a debate making the rounds on twitter about  the “burning fertility clinic” thought experiment.

301,When does the life of a Human Being begin? The EEG (Brain Birth) argument.,1,True,"Greetings all. I am just a lurker wondering if anyone of you have heard of the EEG argument on when a human being begins. I think it serves to really further the scientific end of our case. Basically, it states that a human being is not formed till higher brain activity. As quoted by the JM Goldenring the original author of this idea: ""The brain enables our body, our mind, our personality. The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero until the occurrence of brain death. “At any point, human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense.” 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4078859

Now at what point would we say the fetus has reached significant brain activity to be considered a human being so to say? Numerous Scientists have put it at around 28 to 32 week as this when the fetus develops significant brain function that differentiates us from animals.

http://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/09/archives/fetal-brain-said-to-live-at-28-weeks-role-of-the-brain-studies.html
http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-19/local/me-476_1_brain-stem

So basically based on this idea we can see that the fetus reaches the brain birth criteria to become a human being at around 28 to 31 weeks. Now if we look at Abortion Data we will find that abortions happening beyond 21 weeks represent less than 1.3% of abortions. I would wager that abortions happening in the 28-31 week range are literally non-existent and the abortions that do happen this far are almost always of the case where the mother's life is in danger, or they are medically necessary.

That is a fully living and growing cell that if it is allowed to grow uninhibited and given proper nutrients will be baby in a several months. I'm not the most moral person and have come to terms with the amorality of it and how others view when life starts. Recently I have been thinking about the right to exist. A friend of mine is an abortion survivor and I found myself reflecting on the book unwind and the Casey Anthony trial. I am wondering as people do we have a right to deny other people's existence before they are even allowed to exist? And in the case of Casey Anthony if she would of just had an abortion it would be a completely different circumstances while kind of having he same result (no kid).

*HIGHLIGHTS!*  
Where ""highlights"" = bits and pieces I found particularly ridiculous. All *emphases* mine, all [bracketed comments] mine. Please read the linked article so you have the full context for my commentary. :)  The excerpts begin below:


The freedom to use birth control is protected by the Constitution’s “fundamental right” to privacy. That freedom is a matter of settled law, and *hasn’t been challenged in the slightest by President Trump or his administration*.


Elizabeth Warren, denouncing “this attack on basic health care,” claimed the GOP’s top priority is to deprive women of birth control. “News flash to Republicans,” Warren sneered. [Every paragraph in this entire piece could be followed with ""Jacoby sneered"".] “The year is 2017, not 1917.”

News flash to Warren, et al.: There is no attack on health care [lolwut?], and no one in America is being deprived of birth control [LOLWUT???]. You are losing nothing but the power to force nuns to pay for your oral contraceptives. [What about the nuns that support free contraceptives?  Or the ones that aren't offended by the idea of such a thing? Also, is it just me or is this just another way of screeching ""Taxation is theft!!!""?]

As a matter of economics and public policy, the Affordable Care Act mandate that birth control be supplied for free is absurd. [Citation Needed.]

In carving out an exemption to the ACA mandate for *employers with genuine moral qualms*, the Trump administration is belatedly halting *five years’ worth of bullying* by the federal government.

It is disturbing to see “reproductive rights” hardliners react with such fury to treating nuns with respect and sensitivity. [Yep, we ""reproductive rights"" hardliners sure do hate treating nuns with respect and sensitivity (...Citaion Needed???).] *Especially since birth control will remain as available and affordable as ever.* [Solid gold toilet seats also remain as available and affordable as ever...for the people who can afford them regardless of government assistance.]

It is true that a woman’s unwanted pregnancy can lead to serious costs, but the same is also true of a diabetic’s hyperglycemia. Should insulin be free? [Yes. Universal health care would be lovely, thanks. Our Emergency-Room-only health care is a pretty shit system. What's wrong with wanting a system where everyone has access to appropriate preventative, maintenance, and emergency care?]

By and large, *birth control is inexpensive*; as little as $20 a month without insurance. For low-income women who find that too onerous [Jacoby sneered], the federal government’s Title X program provides subsidized contraception to the tune of nearly $290 million per year. [That...that doesn't actually tell us the degree to which the low-income woman's financial burden is alleviated...]

[Concluding Paragraph]
The White House is right to end the *burden* on religious objectors. But it is the birth-control mandate itself that should be scrapped. *Contraception is legal, cheap, and available everywhere.* [ORLY???] Why are the feds meddling where they aren’t needed? [Ah just fuck everything in this paragraph.]

347,Arguing With Hypothetical Moral Dilemmas,10,True,"So I noticed this post yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/6wd261/hi_i_am_a_prolifer_i_wrote_a_piece_about_why_i_am/?st=J7199KPK&amp;amp;amp;sh=a04be077) and reading through it and the comments I realized how useful it is to use hypothetical moral dilemmas to expose the logical inconsistency of abortion prohibitionist principles without challenging their often inadequate definitions of ""life,"" ""rights,"" ""humanity,"" etc.


I don't know about other people here, but typically when I debate an abortion prohibitionist I will challenge their definitions rather than directly testing the limits of their moral assertions and ethnical framework. I'm thinking now that the latter might produce better results because when I challenge definitions often times the person will get hung up on defining humans by human DNA, failing to understand that that is a circular definition which ignores the fact that evolution changes the genome overtime invalidating it as a metric by which humanity can be universally defined accross time (and thus invalidating any universal moral argument against killing humans) as well as failing to understand that a resulting undesirable logical consequence of defining human beings by the genome is that people with chromosomal abnormalities end up being classified as sub-human.


I call it the ""house on fire"" dilemma, and it takes the following framework:


There is a house on fire. In one room is a jar of X embryos that can/will be implanted in a uterus to be developed into a human baby. In the other room is an actual baby. Or a person's loved one. Or even a dog. It could be any number of things, you can change up what is in the room as you see fit. Heck you might even have the second room be a pregnant woman since they seem to romanticise pregnancy so much. You can only save one. Which do you save and why?


I haven't completely thought through the implications of the different choices, but so far it seems to me that if they choose to save the embryos (because they outnumber the people in the other room) then they invalidate the ability to experience pain (as well as personhood) as a relevant property of moral value. They thus cannot assert that abortion is wrong because a fetus can feel pain. On the other hand, if they choose to save the living entity in the second room, then they implicitly demonstrate that things which possess sentience and personhood have greater value than unborn embryos. Thus they ultimately cannot equate abortion to murder.


Another scenario I thought of is the ""end all abortions button."" You can replace the embryos in the house on fire with the ""end all abortions button,"" or you can ask the person whether or not they would press the button if it meant they would die. I haven't really thought through the implications of this latter scenario yet. If you press the button you're pretty much an ideological lunatic. If you don't press the button you don't really believe abortion is a moral travesty, especially one worth dying for. I'm thinking this question could probably be modified to be more extreme. Perhaps the ""end all abortions button"" kills everyone who has A) gotten an abortion B) performed an abortion or C) defended abortion or is pro-choice. I don't know.

What are your thoughts on these hypothetical scenarios? Are there any other hypothetical scenarios or analogies that you regularly use when you debate these people?

[Edit: another hypothetical I have used in the past is your mother/sister/wife/daughter was raped and wants an abortion. They are also suicidal and state that they would rather kill themselves than give birth. Do you support them in getting an abortion and do you believe you, they, or the doctor should be punished for doing so? Depending on how they answer the question this could reveal anything from sociopathy to contradicting the premise that rape is not a valid reason to kill someone.]",1504235274,20,2017-08-31 23:07:54

Abortion: America’s Biggest Killer


Abortion is a very contentious issue in the American political sphere. There is a wide difference of opinions on the issue, many say it is an issue of privacy, life, or rights. Opinions run wild across the political spectrum, often creating vitriol. Well, this piece most likely won’t help, but it is the truth and should be said, no matter how gruesome. And that is, abortion should be outlawed by the Federal Government because it is the taking of life, it is immoral, and it is illegal under the U.S. Constitution. These are some hefty claims, but they are more obvious than they may seem.

I want to first start by establishing some scientific fact. The most important fact is, a human zygote is composed of unique HUMAN cells and unique DNA independent of the mother. This very combination makes it genetically distinct from all other humans. (Mayo Clinic) The zygote is a completely different human organism from the mother, and those who would say that it is no different from her appendix in that it is a part of her body that doesn’t contribute have a flawed scientific backing. We understand that all 46 chromosomes are present in the zygote and that they are unique to the zygote. Science is progressing extremely fast and gender can now be determined from a simple blood test of a pregnant woman who is 12 weeks along. (Doctor Testimony) Not only gender, but researchers have found every single trait that chromosomes design for a human in the earliest stages of pregnancies. That would have astounded scientists from the turn of the 21st century and as science progresses more evidence for choosing life abounds. But even with all this new and convincing evidence, we can fall back on some old tried and true principles. The four basic principles of life are organization, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction. The human embryo can meet all of these standards with ease. I would also beg the question, can we use the reverse standard of death, to form a standard of life? Examining further, to be clinically dead, your heart must stop, then would the formation of a heart perhaps mark life? Well, if so, the heart begins to beat on the 22nd DAY of pregnancy, rendering large amounts of abortions murder by that standard ALONE, our previous standards withstanding. But to form a more rigorous definition of death, physicians will often use the stoppage of all brain activity as medically dead. Again, this standard alone would render Embryos life after the 40th day, when brain waves start. (Mayo Clinic)  But with those basic principles determined, let’s look at the testimony of trained OBGYNs and Biologists. The first few individuals I’d like to discuss are Professors at the Science departments of well-respected universities. These people stood in front of the Senate and testified their views on life. Micheline Matthews-Roth, who teaches at Harvard, says this: 
I oppose the use of embryonic stem cells because to obtain those cells it is necessary to kill a growing human being. We know from embryology that a new life begins with the formation of the zygote, the cell formed by the union of egg and sperm in fertilization -- this is scientific fact, not religious doctrine. What makes us human is not our looks or mental attributes, but the human chromosomes and genes which we have in our cells from the zygote stage throughout our life. We should not condone killing a member of our species, even for a good reason. (NPR)
That pretty much confirms the facts stated above. However, there is more, Dr. Alfred Bongiovanni said this : 
I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.... I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life.... I am no more prepared to say that these early stages [of development in the womb] represent an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the child prior to the dramatic effects of puberty...is not a human being. This is human life at every stage. (NAAPC)
Jerome Lejeune, often considered the Father of Modern Genetics, said To accept the fact that, after fertilization has taken place, a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion. The human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical conception. It is plain experimental evidence. (NAAPC) I could go on with that exact same philosophy repeated out of the mouths of at least 5 more world renowned scientists who have made such statements, but I think the point is perceived. 

But, there is one final medical reason for the abolition of abortion. To this I refer to Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the co-founder of NARAL, the largest pro-abort political action group, and Abby Johnson the former Director of Planned Parenthood. Scientific fact says, fetuses can feel pain and react to their surroundings. Neither of the Former Pro-Abortionists believed this. Pro-Choicers will often say that reactions from babies in the womb are not available until 26 week, this has been disproven as above, but it wasn’t until the Now Pro-Life abortion Doctors experienced their first ultrasound abortion.  Early in the 70s, ultrasounds were just being developed, as the first one rolled into Dr. Nathanson’s office, he was thrilled to witness his work. As his colleague began, all that changed. He watched as the baby was pulled apart, he went on to write his book “Aborting America” in which he said, “I am responsible for the death of 60,000” and called abortions “humanity’s greatest holocaust”. He made the film “The Silent Scream” to highlight the process of abortions and what really happens during the process of ending a pregnancy. Little did he know that 40 years later a young woman would experience much the same. As Director Johnson was pulled in to assist on an abortion, she noticed an ultrasound, she didn’t give it much mind, she had never seen an abortion performed, but as the abortion started she saw a fetus pop onto it, she the 13 week old bouncing and swimming away from the forceps that was chasing it like a mad dog locked onto its prey, the fetus fought but lost, as the tool sucked the child apart the child limb from limb. Director Johnson resigned that day and never went back. (Abby Johnson) Those two stories are just 2 doctors among at least 2,500 members of the Pro-Life OBGYNs, a group of doctors who reject abortion and some of them, former abortionists. (AAPLOG) In fact, Dr. Nathanson has repeatedly debunked the false statistic that illegal abortions mean dangerous and deadly ones. Well first, even in a legal abortion, you are losing the life of a child, and consider this on Maternal Death. Firstly, let us consider, how do we know the number before abortion was legalized, we don’t. So any number is purely speculative. Secondly, Dr. Nathanson even said: 
How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always ""5,000-10,000 deaths a year. I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose that others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics? The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.


That is pretty damning, but it get’s worse. In 1960 Mary Calderone, a Planned Parenthood board member speculated that 9 out of 10 abortions were performed by licensed doctors and said: they are physicians, trained as such...Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians. In fact, many women have died since abortion’s legalization. But we wouldn’t know because the states with the most abortions (California, New York, et. al.) often don’t need to report maternal death rates. And even in states that do, doctors can record the Cause of Death as, a “hemorrhage” never reported that it was abortion-induced. Now, I concede that here in the states, the data is circumstantial and requires critical thinking, so let’s look abroad for cold hard facts. In Ireland and Malta, the UN reported maternal deaths lower than in the US, and they are extremely Catholic and Anti-Abort nations. And in Poland for another example, the Polish Health ministry reported that maternal death rates dropped when abortions were banned. (FRC) And let’s take a minute to talk about Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood says that 3% of what it does is abortion, but there is a reason why Slate, of all websites, calls it “The Most Meaningless Abortion Statistic ever” and why the Washington Post called it “Very Misleading”. But let’s look at the numbers. According to their annual report, Planned Parenthood commits an average of 325,000 abortions a year. That averages to 1 abortion every 97 seconds. But let’s talk about how much of what they do is abortion, the original query, well, the 325,000 abortions a year divided by last year’s total patient count of 2.5 Million Patients. That mean ONE out of every EIGHT women who walk into a Planned Parenthood, not one in thirty-three, ONE in EIGHT. In fact, they commit 160 abortions for every adoption referral. Let’s talk about what else they do now, they do .97% of the nation's Cervical Cancer screenings, 1.8% of the nation’s Breast Exams, and of course, THIRTY-ONE PERCENT of the nation’s abortions. That’s right, 31%. Let’s not forget they do not offer prenatal care. But that is a PR problem, so how, do they get that 3% figure? They measure everything in “services”. What is a service? An abortion is, but so is a simple pregnancy test. An Abortion which can cost up to $1,500 is weighed the same as a $10 pregnancy test. So if a girl walks in for an abortion, she will get a pregnancy test, the abortion she came in for, an STI test, and a packet of contraceptives. During the visit she got 4 services, she scheduled an abortion, but according to Planned Parenthood, what she did was only 25% abortion. In fact, using this method if all Planned Parenthood patients received an abortion they could claim only 25% of what they do is abortion. Planned Parenthood gives 9.4 million “services”, divide 325,000 by that, you get 3%. And let’s not forget that abortion has a 31% stranglehold on the abortion market, bigger than Samsung on TVs and Chrysler on Cars. So let’s call it for what it is, Planned Parenthood is big business, a big abortion business. One that uses the foulest means of abortion to make a buck. What are those methods, we haven’t even gotten into the full nastiness of Planned Parenthood? We have had doctors from Planned Parenthood talk about using “less crunchy” techniques to harvest the parts of the child. Or perhaps when a different doctor explains the ease with which baby eyeballs and intestines can be extracted. And of course when doctors haggle over the prices of the parts standing in front of a tray filled up with said parts. But it gets much worse when we talk about how the children are harvested. During the first trimester, doctors plunge a tube with an edged tip into the cervix they use the suction part of the tool to rip the child limb from limb while it is still alive and collects it in a vat. This is the type of butchery Director Johnson experienced, it is called Suction Aspiration, but as time goes on, the methods become much more Orwellian. Try Dilation and Curettage where a curette is used to chop the baby up and scrape it right up. How about Dilation and Evacuation, where doctors use forceps to crush the baby, including the now developed Brain and Spine, but this usually results in unusable parts. So what do they use to save the parts, they use Intact Dilation and Extraction, otherwise known as Partial-Birth Abortion. Doctors will use an ultrasound to find a baby’s legs, use forceps to pull them into the birth canal, they deliver the entire baby, except the head, at which point they stab the child in the neck severing the now developed cerebral cortex and ending the child’s life, even while most of it has been delivered into the world. Then, of course, you could side with Former President Barack Obama who supported Post-Birth abortion, that is right, he said that if your doctor somehow botched an abortion before birth, and the child was delivered alive, that killing it post-birth was a protected right. You ask me, that is infanticide. So, I ask, when a fetus can move away and detect the pain and the suffering, how is that a safe medical procedure? When from the moment of conception, you are dealing with new life, how is that a “moral” operation? And that when the vast majority of this operation is performed where a forceps is used to pull the fetus apart, or where a vacuum is used to suck it into a collection vat, sometimes heart still beating, how is that ok by society? And when the biggest medical argument against illegalization is a House of Cards promulgated by decade old lies. How is this an act to be defended? If you ask 2,500 of our nation’s finest caretakers, it’s not, it’s murder. And from the date of this article’s publishment, the cause of death of just under 60 million Americans. Compare that to every American killed by war, 1.2 million.


Now that we have covered some scientific reasons against abortions and we have established an unborn child as life, we can delve into the legal world. But to compose any good legal argument for or against abortion, we must look at the crux of the issue in law, Roe v. Wade. The first thing we need look at is what Roe decided. Most Americans would think that Roe created a limited right to abortion. In fact, the court did just the opposite, they said, We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. (Roe v Wade) Ok, fair enough, that decision is from 1973, scientific evidence for Life wasn’t nearly as strong, however, instead of cautiously allowing science to deliver an answer, or revise the decision once evidence came out, they created an unlimited right to be abortion, albeit one that can be stymied by States at the arbitrarily created “point of viability”.  However, we can also find a sentence in the ruling in Roe’s companion case, Doe that says this : We agree with the District Court, 319 F.Supp. at 1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors --physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient. (Doe v Bolton) That means that a doctor can override a restriction if he deems a woman in “emotional” duress because of carrying a pregnancy to term. In fact, we can even look at the cases of abortions being defended by the Prosecutors, the woman that sued Texas and Georgia, were in fine health and simply did not want to carry the child to term. (FRC) Now you may ask, “Where did this ruling come from, surely the Court must have had a Basis?” Well, that basis came from a “right” not even written in the Constitution. Both the Doe and Roe ruling reference an inherent Right to “Privacy”. The word privacy is never even used in the Constitution. (Constitution) This “right” to privacy that was ruled upon, made abortion completely an issue of Women’s Health. Well, we have established life from conception and when the court overlooked it and wrote that they need not determine life to rule on it in the earliest stages, they effectively made complete abortion legal, on a basis of a “right” not found in the Constitution. When the court authors an opinion, that sends the signal for ALL law enforcement to uphold EVERY single letter of it, sometimes that can have ill wished consequences. In fact, even Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sees it as an issue of equal protection, and not “privacy”. She even said in an interview with a Kansas newspaper “It is not the way courts generally work”.  And even off the bench, Pro-Choicers are singing a similar tune with John H. Ely of Yale saying: “because it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”  And best of all, the Clerk of Justice Blackmun, the authoring Justice, called it: “one of the most intellectually suspect constitutional decisions of the modern era.” But beyond just mere opinion, there are verifiable sources in U.S. Law. For example, When we look at the 5th and 14th Amendments, they contain what is called the Due Process Clause. In the 5th it reads: nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. And when we take a look at the 14th, it sounds rather familiar: nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. To me, having established life at conception, that seems rather a clear cut, but there is, even more, some would have the fetus exempted from citizenship, but as a fetus is a person, that comes into conflict with both Title 8 of U.S. Code and Article II of the Constitution. Both establish that birthright means citizenship. We can find that from the apparentness of Life at Conception, there is citizenship. Even the American people as a whole seem to be catching on, 61% of Americans believe that once a fetal heartbeat begins, abortion should be illegal, as we have discussed this occurs much earlier than most would think. In fact, Most Americans, 53%, would not overturn Roe, however, when explained that Roe creates an unlimited right to abortion, that contrast these numbers, only 6% of Americans agree with this unlimited right, 86% agreeing with banning 3rd trimester bans, 72% with 2nd, and a further 61% with heartbeat bans as said above. (Gallup/Ipsos)  However, these numbers do drop in the cases of rape or incest. If we delve further however into this issue, we see in a survey conducted by the Pro-Choice Guttmacher Institute, we see some interesting polls on why abortions happen. We see that 92% of abortions are purely elected. Less than 1% are Incest and rape driven, combined. And even then, I ask, why should a child get the Death Penalty for the crimes of the father. Why should a child conceived in rape, be executed, when even in the 2008 case of Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court ruled that a 400 lbs. man that raped his 8-year-old stepdaughter could not be put to death and overruled his sentence given to him by the Louisiana jury. (Kennedy v Louisiana) If even HE cannot be legally executed, a child rapist, why should any child conceive of rape be murdered for their father’s heinous crime, when he himself, cannot be? This among the myriad Constitutional provision and standing legal precedent is why the illegality of abortion is truly the most unenforced standing law in the nation, at a dire cost.


The final field in which we examine abortion’s many nuances is its morality. This topic trickier than either Medicine or Law is often divided into two camps, Morality from Religion, and Morality based on secular foundations. There is an argument against abortion to be derived from both. For the religious viewpoint, we can look no further than the Bible itself. But before I delve directly into the verses that I find most damning, there is an elephant in the room. The Bible NEVER specifically references abortion. For one reason only, in the time before Jesus until afterward when Paul composed the final books, abortion was so unthinkable that it was an unwritten law. Infertility was seen as a curse, and pregnancy a gift, so the Prophets didn’t need to write anything about its evil. That view about the sacredness of the family had vanished, but the Bible, and its verses on the beauty of God and his gifts haven’t. The first few verses are about King David and his relationship with the divine. Starting with Psalms 139: 13-16 which reads: 
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.My substance was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
This reaffirms Genesis 2:7 which says: And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. Both of these powerful passages make a point to say how much care that God puts into forming babies in the womb. But there is much more, in Psalms 51:5 we see the truth, that unborn children are responsible for original sin from conception when it says: Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. And in Genesis on 3 separate occasions is the likeness of God confirmed, in 1:26-27, 5:1, and 9:6. And again, we can see that, though God’s perfect image was affected in the fall of man from Eden, it was not erased. This can be read in 1 Cor. 11:7 and James 3:9. We can also see in Romans 5:12 and Hebrews 7:10 that the unborn child receives original sin and is morally accountable at conception, as all unbaptized humans are. Romans reads: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. And in Hebrews, we find: For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. And even beyond this level of biblical morals that God wishes to follow, we must look no further than Exodus 21:22-25 to find the sanctity of the pregnancy in Jewish culture. In Exodus it says this of the death of unborn: 
 If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.


To me that is rather clear that the death of an unborn is taken just as seriously of that as a born child. At this point, I think that everyone that treats the Bible with great reverence as a book of worldly wisdom has come to understand the immorality that abortion embodies. But even for Secular folks, their philosophies as decent people are sure to be challenged by the non-religious issues posed. The first few standards are imposed by Roe. Beginning with what was discussed earlier, Roe draws some lines, one of the most infamous being that of the viability point. Ruling that before a child is viable to survive outside the womb, abortions ought to be legal, however, the first bit of our time together was disputing when a child became life, and that was conception. Life is Life, even if it needs to be nurtured. Would you consider a deer that was hit by a car and needs to be nurtured and have medical attention to not be alive, even if you left it alone it would die? Would you feel this way of your grandmother of brother that needs emergency care? This is the standard Roe set, and it’s unacceptable. Another hallmark of Roe is their trepidation separation of separating humanity from personhood. The ruling confirmed, that even if a human, the legal definition of “persons”, may not apply. This opened up a way for some radical definitions of personhood to be proposed. Ones that proposed, not biological definitions of life or personhood, but cultural ones. Francis Crick said with Nature magazine a child was considered to be legally born when two days old, it could be examined to see whether it was an ‘acceptable member of human society. And it was famed Anthropologist Ashley Montagu that stated A newborn baby is not truly human until he or she is molded by cultural influences later. (Probe) And Professor Joseph Fletcher perhaps holds the most blood-curdling view, writing in his book, Humans without some minimum of intelligence or mental capacity are not persons, no matter how many of these organs are active, no matter how spontaneous their living processes are. (Probe) He would go on to use 40 IQ as a benchmark for personhood.  These are not just arguments supporting abortion’s supposed morality, but infanticide, and the last one, the murder of the most vulnerable in society. Now that we have covered some of the current standards imposed by the courts, and the opinions on them, we can look at the true value of the unborn. Now, some people would say that fetuses have no rights. This included the Democratic nominee for President this year, Hillary Clinton. (Richardson) However, even IF an unborn child is not a person, and we can disregard all juxtaposing information on that and the life of the child, I would ask this. Even if the child is not a person, why is it afforded no rights? There are many animal rights groups, surely they don’t think that the animals are people, but they do believe they have rights. I myself agree, they are living beings and should be treated respectfully. However, many of the members of these animal rights groups, such as PETA, take an interesting stance on abortion. MANY members of animal rights groups are rather militant liberals, yet, when they say they animals should be given rights perpendicular to human rights, they omit the unborn. They never seem to say, “Hey at least in some stage this baby becomes a baby”, even if they don’t recognize life at conception as modern science had granted us. This hypocrisy really is both repulsive and mind-boggling. But it doesn’t get any better from there. A fetus has value, I think we can all agree, an infinite value in fact, of endless possibilities of a new person in the world. When a mother plans on carrying a baby to term, that baby is seen as having almost infinite value, yet, when pulling in for the insidious practice of abortion, that value goes away. Why doesn't the mother get to decide the value of her child? And say, in a tragedy, a pregnant woman, is murdered, the assailant is charged with murder of course, but how many times? Two counts, or just one? Does the death of the fetus mean another murder to be prosecuted for? Hard to say, but if you follow liberal abortion theory the answer is clearly no, that life is not found in the womb. Now that we have discussed some philosophy and principle behind the issue, I want to paint you a picture. Imagine a woman. Her husband has just left her, and she is to move in with her parents. However, she has a problem, her parents don’t know what she does. The absent father impregnated her and she is faced with a choice. Does she get an abortion or not, being a devout woman she goes to the nearby church and is convinced to choose life. That woman’s name is Ann Dunham, she is no longer with us, but her child is. You see, thirteen years after Ann had passed, her son was elected the first Black President in American history. The man that supported radical abortion, was the very one who grabbed life from its deadly jaws. The woman who wasn’t quite ready for a child gave birth to a leader of the free world (By The People), so I would implore all mothers, before choosing an abortion, think about the unlimited value your child could possess. So after all that heavy moralism, I want to end on a happy note. Just something in our society that already recognizes life in the womb. If you believe that a baby is part of a mother’s body, do walk up to her and say, How’s your Body? No, I would hope not at least, you say How’s the Baby? You recognize that the baby is a separate being with its own welfare. These values are recognized across the spectrum of humanity, from the secular to the non-secular. They aren’t values that can be easily cast aside nor should they, they just need be exposed to shine their proud light, much like the children they protect.

So, now that I have presented the facts, the evidence, and the morals, it is your turn. I would ask you to understand the medical evidence, the law, and the beliefs of the philosophies of the world, ranging in value. And I would ask you to choose a side, choose what you can do to help society, and after all that I have said about the above, I would plead you, choose life.

I'm aware the relative safety can change depending on where you are, but I'm talking overall. It's good pay and it's for a good cause but I'm too much of a coward to die for even this noble of a cause. Should I at least try?

I'm trying to get her to care more about these issues instead of seeing them as a one dimensional moral argument.  She rebukes my logic at every turn, and when it comes to this I'm usually too tired to even think of a counter argument.  She's extremely catholic (which I was raised to be) and I'm agnostic atheist.

389,"What is a ""human being?""",0,True,"Many abortion prohibitionists build their arguments against abortion without clearly defining their terms, among them ""human being"" and ""person."" In my experience I have found it pretty easy to refute most of their definitions as fallacious in one way or another. This being said, I was wondering if anyone here has constructed a sound definition of these terms that can be extrapolated in a way that makes abortion morally permissible without making some forms of murder morally permissible.

For example defining ""humans"" by DNA suggests that some human beings that are missing a chromosome may be technically ""sub-human"" since they do not completely match the genetic code. And at that rate, chimpanzees might be considered ""sub-human,"" since there's no clear line by which to differentiate between ""humans"" and ""non-humans"" if the genetic code does not determine whether or not something is ""human"" in an absolute sense.

Here are my working definitions.

Human: of or related to human beings 

Human Being: an entity SUFFICIENTLY belonging to the genus homo sapien sapiens characterized by a past or present exhibition of personhood.

OR

Human Being: an entity SUFFICIENTLY belonging to the genus homo sapien sapiens characterized by a past acquisition of personhood.

Person: any entity assumed to possess sufficient potential for advanced abstract reasoning/cognition, typically based off of the observation or presence of sustained normative brain function.

Some things to note about these definitions:
- an artificial intelligence could hypothetically be considered a ""person.""
- Dead bodies are ""human beings,"" but not ""people,"" but could reasonably be referred to as ""dead people/persons.""
- Prior to ~25 weeks gestation, most unborn entities cannot be correctly described as ""human beings"" given that they have not yet acquired the ""sustained brain function"" which characterizes personhood.
- Most late term abortions are classifiable as murder, although there are some strong arguments to be made regarding non-viable fetuses and abortions performed to protect the life of the mother.

Disclaimer: I have also seen some people in the prochoice community confuse the foster care system with the private adoption system.

483,Why I ditched the pro-life crowd,48,True,"As the title suggests I was pro-life for most of my life. Ironically, I was pro-life before I even understood sex - influenced by older family members. The anti-abortion rhetoric is unfortunately very convincing when people tell you they ""just want to save the babies"". So I was pro-life until I got pregnant by accident. At that point everything that I had been told went out the window. I finally understood. This was my body, I protected myself but biology won. I'd be damned if anyone told me I couldn't have the final say in whether I brought a life onto this earth. My accidently pregnancy was pretty public pretty quickly. I was in a sorority and work travels fast. But everyone was so kind and so helpful. I was going to have a support network no matter what I chose to do. Friends and family members came out the woodwork tell me their stories of secret abortions. Three of the people I was closest to had an abortion and I had never known. I felt embarassed for anytime I may have made a pro-life comment in their company. They weren't irresponsible or careless or heartless. They were women make the best choice for themselves and their unborn child. I learned that abortion doesn't only happen because the women doesn't want a child. Two stories broke my heart. 

A woman very close to me never thought that she could be a mother. Her mother was emotionally abusive and her father sexually abusive. She was 33 when she became pregnant and in a committed relationship. She chose abortion because she had too many residual issues and didn't feel she could give that child a proper life. She was devestated but still thinks she made the right choice. Years later that parter became physically abusive and she was able to leave without having to involve children. 

Another woman told me her story of a surprise pregnancy at 26. She had a job but the father was not around. She knew that they're was no way she could afford a baby and that she would be dooming them to a life of poverty and struggle. She said that it was the hardest choice of her life. But she still thinks she made the right one. She is now married and has two adopted children that have a wonderful life because of her choice.

As for me, I chose to have my daughter and she has become the light of my life. But I was only able to because of the vast amount of resources at my disposal. I have financial and emotional support. I have a loving partner that has put our daughter first since the moment she was placed in his arms. I am not blind to the privledge I have been afforded. Had I not had these resources I would have chosen abortion and looking at my daughter that breaks my heart.

I don't want any woman to be faced with this same choice. It is so emotionally difficult. This is why I'm pro-choice. I want everyone who wants birth control to have it so they don't have to face a surprise pregnancy. I want better programs for struggling mothers so they know they can raise their child if they want to. I don't want any women to abort for any other reason than she doesn't WANT to raise a child right now. 

So from a former pro-lifer, I'm sorry. I regret that I was ever so ignorant to think that I should have a say in another woman's uterus. I'm sorry that I carelessly spouted hurtful statements around women who may have had to make that difficult choice themselves. I never realized how many of my own loved ones made that choice themselves. I'm now proudly and unapologetically pro-choice and I'm thankful for the experience that clarified my viewpoint.

352,"""Abortion is the modern day equivalent to slavery"" is such an insult to anyone who has actually been or currently is enslaved.",66,True,"To compare the actual suffering of a human being to the discontinuation of the development of a mentally inactive organism is absolutely disgusting. 

It'd honestly be more accurate to say that BANNING abortions is more comparable to slavery.

Pro-lifers are fighting to force a woman to suffer. 9 months of their life, stolen. Their bodies, harmed. Their future and life plans, drastically altered. Their social lives, potentially decimated. Not to mention the emotional damage that comes a long with all of it. 

It's like sentencing someone to prison for 9 months, forcing them to take hormones, forcing them to gain a ton of weight, stealing $30,000-$50,000 (assuming they give the baby up), then shoving a foot ball in their vagina, and then telling them to deal with it and get over it. Forcing someone to have a child is like forcing someone to have sex. Sex (like child birth), when consensual, can be a positive thing. However, when you force it on someone, it can be a terrifying, life altering experience.

353,Abortion Debate,0,True,"Hello! I would like to open a thread for debating about abortion.

I'm Pro-Life and think that abortion except for very rare cases is immoral(regardless of whether it's legal or not) and as always, we consolidate our beliefs when they are challenged and rather than circle jerk for validation of beliefs I think it's more useful to engage in a good debate.

Here's my argumentation. Objectively and scientifically, fetuses are living human beings. Not only are they life, but human life, and more than human life they are human beings. Not fully matured of course, just as children aren't fully matured human beings, in fact, I'm not even a fully matured human being either, but they are a human being at a certain stage in their development.

So, the issue isn't about a fetus being a human being but about personhood. But personhood is a philosophical concept, not a scientific one, and there's no consensus about it, I've asked multiple people and they've all given me all sorts of answers. And they've all been incomplete. Even if I were to personally agree with them, how can we be sure that we're not just agreeing on an opinion but rather on fact? I don't think we can. Historically whenever human beings have been robbed(or reduced) of their personhood it has served as a justification for genocide or other types of atrocities based on the current scientific or philosophical knowledge of the time. There are multiple cases throughout history and to my knowledge there hasn't been a single case were we have been right about it. Cases from slavery, to religious groups, to ethnical groups, to races, to older people, to the mentally ill, to even children. Some propose certain markers for personhood which I can personally see some merit to, but the issue is that for example, for consciousness... well, children before around 18 months haven't developed consciousness. Does this mean that they are not persons and as they are not persons I can kill them wantonly?
The issue of personhood is an interesting one and a complex one and it should be approached carefully. Let's say we encounter an alien civilization... then I agree we should tackle on the subject of personhood. But that's because the stakes are high. In the abortion debate, the stakes aren't really that high in the majority of cases. It's basically human life/genocide vs convenience/irresponsibility. Morally those two shouldn't be conflated. It's like saying, ""well, if Uncle Thomas dies I'll inherit $1,000 USD. So, can I kill him? Is it a person?"". Sure, the question in that case has an answer, but why even make the question in the first place?

Another angle is for some people to agree that the fetus has the same rights, but that the woman's right to choose is superior to the fetus's right to life. I'd say that there's a hierarchy of rights, not all rights have the same value and the right to life stands at the top of most(if not all) other rights. The mother chose to have sex, and there are natural(and good) consequences of sex: procreation. We all know of these consequences, and the risk of having sex, so if a woman has the right to choose sex, she also has the responsibility for the consequences of that action. I have the right to drink, but if I drink, get drunk and crash into someone, I'm responsible towards that person.
We naturally and legally don't hold all rights equal so to that argument I'd say that the right of that other human being for whom you are responsible beats your right to choose. Also, if it weren't the case it would mean that the right to life of another human being rests on the arbitrary(that could go to an extreme of being a whim) choice of another person. Those two things also don't conflate.

I appreciate response in advance and would like for people to consider the answers beforehand to see if a closely similar answer hasn't been posted in the thread before posting.

In this era of social media however, every one from around the world is able to shove their opinions down someone else's throat with just a click of a button. I was always pro choice but I always said that I would never choose that option. 
Then, as if the universe was testing my morality, it happened. At 18 years old, I was pregnant. 
I started my period when I was 13 years old like most women. After a year the cramps started to become very painful. So painful I would curl up into a ball on my bathroom floor and miss days of school at a time. I tried everything I could to relieve the pain; pills, pads, exercise, but nothing worked. When I was 16 I started dating my current boyfriend. When we started dating I just KNEW. He was the one I would lose my virginity too. I convinced my mom to let me get birth control pills. Which wasn't hard, for some reason my parents just always did everything I wanted, especially my mom. Practically ignored my 3 brothers just to make sure I had a good life. Anyways, I had friends from school tell me that the pill made their cramps almost completely disappear. So no cramps? No possibility of getting pregnant? Cool. done deal. Only catch was that you had to go to the DR and get a Pap smear done. There was NO way I was about to let a COMPLETE stranger stick their fingers up me. HELL. NO. So we get to the Dr and she asks why I want the pills and I tell her about all the pain and crying and missed school. She asks if I'm sexually active and I tell her no, but I was seeing a guy. At this point I had absolutely no idea what a Pap smear was, and no idea that the Dr needed to do it for the BC. Oh and I'm on my period. THANKS MOM FOR TELLING ME. The look on my Dr's face when she asks me to put on the gown and I tell her "" okay but I'm on my period so I have to keep my underwear on."" She laughed at me and said"" you had no idea about any of this did you?"" UH NO. I DID NOT. She was nice and wrote me the prescription anyway. She also talked my mom into getting me these fancy chewable tablets that tasted like mints. They were 50$ A MONTH. Yeah we switched over to a different brand pretty quickly. After a month or two of being on the pill something wonderful happened. My cramps were GONE. Not a single knife in my gut. Also as a bonus my period only lasted 3 days instead of 7! Of course there were side effects too. Zits. Everywhere. Mood swings that could give you whip lash and an overall lack of energy. But I didn't care. I wasn't curled up in a ball crying once a month so I was happy. Fast forward a year and my prescription has run out and I need to make a new Dr appointment. So I go in, prepared this time for what they need to do. When I got there I completely panicked and lied to the Dr. I told her I was on my period. IT WORKED. I got another prescription and didn't have to have someone shove their fingers up my vagina. 
So a few more years go by and my boyfriend and I started getting pretty serious. Life at home was pretty rough after my parents split up. After I graduated high school I spent more and more time at his place. Eventually his parents just told me to stay, and I did. I had forgotten what it felt like to be part of a family. They were FAR from normal, but it was better than dealing with a drunk father and a self loathing mother who didn't have a clue how the world worked. It took my dad two weeks to notice I had moved out. And when he finally figured it out all he could say was "" oh. So you can't go pick up your brothers then?""  I was tired of being the adult in the house. Always making sure my brothers had what they needed. I figured if I left then maybe they would finally get the attention they deserved. 
That never happened. My brothers kept on lashing out, doing dumber and dumber things to try to get some attention and everything with them just went to shit. I'll never forget my grandmother telling me 
"" you're the only one I have any hope for"" 
And yet she didn't do anything to stop it either. It's like every one in my family just decided that I was going to be great and successful so screw the rest of them. 1 out of 4 ain't bad! I was under so much pressure that I quit college because I was so afraid to fail. I told my dad that I had enrolled in online classes at a tech college in my boyfriends town, but I never signed the paperwork. After a couple of months at my boyfriends place I decided to find a job. I hated living their rent free and wanted to earn my keep. His parents objected but it made me feel better. I started working at this pizza shop and was dreading it because I've always been bad with people. Talking to customers absolutely terrified me but no one else would hire an 18 year old with no job history. My bosses ended up being INCREDIBLE. They pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me so many valuable things. For the first time in a long time I started to feel like I belonged somewhere. 
Of course they couldn't beat the social awkwardness out of me that easily. Eventually my birth control prescription ran out and it was time for the dreaded Pap smear. So like any responsible adult would do, I avoided it. My pills ran out and I avoided going to get more. New town, new doctor, no way. A few months go by and I started noticing weird things about my body. Certain smells would make me sick. I would get diarrhea then become constipated. Car rides made me dizzy. My boobs felt like over inflated balloons. It was a never ending cycle for weeks! I figured it was my body trying to get used to not having the added hormones. Of course the first thing you always do when you feel sick is google search the symptoms. Pregnancy kept popping up but I thought there is no way. We were always careful, and we always used protection. The more I researched the more I realized how much my symptoms matched the signs. So I went to Walmart and bought a test. Thank GOD for self check out. I could never look someone in the face while purchasing it. I read online that your best bet for an accurate reading was to use it just after waking up in the morning. That's when your urine has the most concentrated amount of hormones. So the next morning I go to the bathroom, careful to make sure no one sees what I have in my hand. I peed on the stick and waited for the longest 2 minutes of my life. 
And there is was. Staring back at me. Those two little pink lines deciding the rest of my future. I couldn't find the words to tell my boyfriend so I took a picture of the test and texted it to him. I cried. I knew he didn't want a baby. I didn't want a baby either. I mean I did, still do, just not then. Having a baby is supposed to be this magical wonderful thing and all I could think about was how hard he was working for his dreams. And I couldn't take that from him. We talked about adoption but both realized that we would be too selfish to give it up once it was born. One thing was certain, NO ONE could ever know. His parents are great but also VERY old fashioned. If they knew they would have forced us to get married and practically take over our entire lives. My family could never know.. I couldn't bare the thought of disappointing them. I couldn't look them in the eyes and tell them that I fucked up. That their amazing, wonderful, talented daughter had just ruined her future. I couldn't bare the thought of them looking at me the way they look at my brothers. So we decided to get an abortion. I needed to do it is fast as I could for fear of changing my mind. So we found a clinic and made the appointment. It was about a week away and my schedule at work had already been set. I tried to get someone to swap off my shift but I had no luck. I hated the thought of lying to the people who did nothing but care for me, but there's no way I could tell them the truth. It was a half lie, I told them I had to go to the doctor for an outpatient procedure in regards to my uterus. All you have to do is mention the word period and men go running. Told them I was getting a test done and couldn't work that Friday. And of course they understood and helped me out, but it killed me. If they knew what I was about to do would they still care about me? Would they look at me with disappointment in their eyes? There's no way I could find out. The procedure was expensive. $450. We thought about seeing if health insurance covered it but I was too afraid that it could get back to my dad somehow so we were on our own. Luckily when I turned 18 my sister helped me apply for a student credit card. The cash advance limit was only $300 so we took the rest from our savings. 
I remember the day VERY clearly. It was April 9th, 2013. It was a Friday and the trees had begun a bloom. Nature was giving birth to a new season and I was about to destroy something beautiful.
We pull up to the clinic and there's a swarm of soccer moms with picket signs yelling at everyone about going to hell. I felt like I was going to be sick. What if someone recognized me at work? Would they say something? We got out of the car and they immediately started screaming at me to get back in. So I held my head up, kept my eyes straight and tried not to look like they were tearing my soul apart. We walk in and there's a few other woman in the waiting room. A few older, a few younger, and one girl who was sitting with her mom. There's no doubt in my mind that my mom would've been there with me if I had asked, but I couldn't destroy the image she had of me being her perfect little girl. We sat for 1/2 an hour and I get called back. I took one last look at my boyfriend, searching for anything in his eyes that he wanted me to stop. All I could see was worry, so I squeezed his hand and told him I would be alright and back I went. They started with an ultrasound to determine how far along I was. 10 weeks. They asked if I wanted to see but I refused. I didn't want to risk getting attached to it. Next I went into a room with a counselor who asked me why I wanted to get an abortion. I told her that I was too young, and wasn't ready to be a mom. She asked me again if I was sure this is what I wanted. I nodded and she had me sign some papers. I went to a room where they asked me to change out of my clothes and into a gown. I was to keep my underwear on but to put on a sanitary pad for the bleeding after. I went to a room where they gave me a cup of pills. They wanted to know if I wanted the pain pills but I refused them. I felt like I didn't deserve them, like I needed to be punished. I took them and sat in a different waiting room with a few other girls. I recognized the girl who's mom was with her and sat nearby. No one talked, but I felt we all had a silent understanding of why we were there. No judgements. The girl from the lobby asked me how old I was. I said I was 18 and she laughed a little. It's no secret that I look like a 12 year old and I don't blame her for not believing me. I could tell she took the pain pills, her words were slurring. Suddenly a sharp pain started in my abdomen. It got worse and worse until I was laying on my side in the chair, digging my nails into the arm rests. I kept telling myself that it was nothing, that I was used to my cramps being like this every month. The pain kept spreading and made its way to my back, legs and chest. The nurse called my name and I went into the back room. I could feel the panic rising and kept trying to calm myself but I couldn't keep my hands from shaking as they asked me to remove my underwear. I got into the table and put my feet in the stirrups. The doctor comes in and it's an older Indian guy. I spent the last 3 YEARS avoiding having a doctor sticking their hands in my lady parts and some random 40 year old man is about to stick a machine inside me. I lay back and close my eyes, just wanting it to be over with already. I'm still shaking and the nurse grabs my hand to help calm me down. I feel cold metal slide inside me and the nurse tells me that I'm going to feel a lot of pressure in just a moment. Suddenly I could feel a huge snap inside me, and the pain was unlike anything I have ever felt. It felt as if a hot spike had been pushed through my abdomen, and was being twisted in circles. I screamed and the nurse tried to calm me down. I wondered if the girls in the waiting area could hear me. I hoped my boyfriend couldn't hear me. A few seconds later the machine was done and the doctor removed it from inside me. The nurse leaned me forward and I puked. Luckily she had gotten the tray in front of me in time. Her and the doctor left the room and I sat there on the table crying and shaking. After a few minutes the nurse brought me to another waiting room that had beds. I lied there for a while just staring at the ceiling. A nurse came by and asked if I had a ride home. I told her my boyfriend was in the lobby and she said I could go. When I walked out they had me sign some discharge papers and I could see my ultrasound picture in my file. I wanted to see it so badly but forced myself to look away. We walked out of the clinic and I could see the group of protesters looking at us. I lowered my head in shame and got in the car. 
For the next few days all I did was lay on the bed and cry. HOW could I have done that. Why did I destroy something that was a part of me, a part of him. Whenever my boyfriend came home from work I would pretend I was okay. I didn't want him to feel guilty. I couldn't let him feel what I was feeling. My boobs started leaking discharge and it was like a steady reminder of what I had done. When I went back to work I couldn't look my boss in the eye when he asked how everything was. The nurse told me not to do any heavy lifting but I did it anyway, as if I was trying to punish myself. The next couple of weeks I was an emotional wreck. When the hormones finally left my system it wasn't as bad but the guilt was still eating away at me. At that moment I made a promise to myself. That I would DO something with my life. For years I've said I would open a bakery but never actually had any thought about learning to do it. I made it my mission in life to make sure that my boyfriend and I would make something of ourselves, and follow our dreams. Because if we don't, then what in the world did I just go through that for? 

Today is April 9th, 2017. 4 years to the date and I'm finally ready to tell my story. I've replayed that day dozens and dozens of times in my head. Every single time I can still feel the all of the pain. But I made a promise. I made a promise to my unborn  child that I would build a life for the children that I will have. Every time that I felt like giving up, when I felt like things were just way too hard, I reminded myself "" your child gave ITS LIFE so you could make one"". 
So here I am, 4 years later and I'm now the General manager of that little pizza shop. I over see 25 employees who all look to me to guide them. My bosses have plans for me to buy into my own franchise. As I am writing this, I'm sitting in a car with him on our way to Florida for a big business convention. They tell me all the time how far I've come, and how proud they are of me. And all it does is make me work harder. I'm finally at a point in my life where I can start to forgive myself, and even feel proud of myself for all that I've accomplished. I purchased a spot in our local market and have started to sell my baked goods, that was last week. And I'm never going to stop. I will never stop growing and building this life I have created. Not for me, but for my children's future. 

Most prolifers just think that a woman uses abortion as a way to clean up their mess. They think that if abortion is legal then woman will just sleep around whenever with whoever because hey! You can just get an abortion so who cares! And they LOVE to throw around their religion like they're the holiest piece of shit to ever walk the planet. There is NOTHING righteous about calling a woman a baby murderer as she's walking across a parking lot. Getting an abortion was the HARDEST decision I have ever had to make. A friend asked me once ""what was the worst thing I had ever done?"" I had to dodge the question, and I simply said "" I can't tell you"" because it still HURTS. But I do not, and will not ever regret my decision. I had a CHOICE. And I CHOSE to give my future children the life they deserved. I was unable to provide that at the time.  I firmly believe that every woman and man for that matter has a right to plan their own future. That's the problem, pro choice doesn't mean you HAVE to get an abortion. It means that a woman should have the right to CHOOSE if she wants too. I NEVER in my life thought I would be capable of doing it myself, but I do not have a RIGHT to tell another woman that she can't. So before you post that anti- abortion blog, before you pick up that protest sign, STOP and THINK about that woman. What is going on in her life that she feels she can't have a family? You can't see her face behind the computer screen but her eyes are full of fear and guilt. You try so hard to make the world believe that you're a good person. You spend so much time feeding on woman's guilt that you turn into the monster you're trying to destroy. I'm not writing this to bully ProLifers into changing their beliefs. I'm writing this so other woman can find some comfort in knowing that there is someone who understands what they have gone through. What they're still going through, and will be going through for the rest of their life. So pick your head up, and go out and do something with your life. DONT let that sacrifice be for nothing.

357,"A hypothetical: How much does pregnancy cost, other than the usual costs.",7,True,"Something I've been rolling around in my head for a little bit, when talking to folks about things like child support or whatever, is that women, just because biology works like that, suffer things that men do not despite any financial willingness, because they have uteruses and we men are not seahorses.

I have paraphrased most of his lecture, but I recommend downloading this lecture to iTunes university on your phone (its free) and listening to it while walking or driving so you don't get bored. 

Lecture by Professor Robert Wyman

""So the abortion debate is 'when does life begin?'. Luckily that is a question that biology can say something about. 


What statement is the most common statement made on this? Usually that life begins with conception. 

Quote by George Will ""It is a biological fact, not a theological postulate that such life is a continuum from life until death""

[he goes on to quote some else(?) who stated that all basic biology text books say this:] ""A fetus is a human being distinct from, while dependent on its mother. It deserves the full protection of its rights. ""

[Wyman] That isn't at all what a biology text book says. A biology text book shoes something quite different; it shows life as a cycle. There is no start point. Fertilization is just one of the events going around the cycle. This is the essence of sexual reproduction. 

The cycle is a switch between a haploid (one copy of each chromosome) and a diploid (two copies of each chromosome). In sexual reproduction there is always some version of this one copy, two copy reproduction. 

[he goes on to explain sexual and asexual reproduction: fun fact, strawberries reproduction asexually!] 



""the whole phrasing of this debate of when does life begin is a cultural hold over from the many centuries ago when there was no scientific understanding. So the question, 'when does life begin?', well, what is the alternative to it being a cycle of life, to something that is not alive? ...that would be called spontaneous generation.""

He says what made people think spontaneous generation was how life began was from observing a caterpillar that transforms into a moth. People believed caterpillars formed a cocoon and died inside of it (turning into a nutrition goo), and from that a butterfly would form....Human life, he says, was presume to be made from menstrual blood. From this he relates the current assumption that life has a beginning and an end; that life comes from ""not-life"", when in fact, life is a continual cycle. Because fertilization is the final constitution of the set up of a fetus, people assume that this is where ""not-life"" becomes uniquely ""life"".

[he goes on to explain how a ""the final genetic constitution is not set until some time *after* fertilization] He uses calico cats as an example, explaining how they have big black patches and big orange patches. ""What you're seeing is, at a certain point in development there will be one cell with two sets of genes, one will have the melanin gene which will make the patch black, and the other will make it orange""  He says in one cell the gene for orange might turn off and you'll get a black patch, or vice versa. He says the number of patches can tell you at what cell stage this process happened, because each of those patches are the descendant of a single cell.


[next he goes on to discuss development] He says development is a very ""chancie"" process. He says 78% percent of fertilized conceptions ""die"", and the mother will not even know she is pregnant because this usually happens in the first few weeks of  the pregnancy. He points out that religious folk who believe humans come back from death in the body in which they died, must also believe that a fetus enters heaven in a test tube. He says you it takes, on average, 5 months to get pregnant. He explains a scenario where a woman tries for 5 months to get pregnant and asks, well what is happening in the other 4 months? The sciences says the woman is getting pregnant each month, but the fetus doesn't make it past the first few weeks, so it is not noticeable. If pro-lifers believe that life begins at conception, then this is a tragedy! When a person dies there has to be a death certificate, an inquest; for example, did the mother drink alcohol, or smoke, or do something to cause her fetus to die? And if she did, should she be tried? He also says that even after birth, there is a possibility that the child will still die in the first few years (he says something like 1/3 of births)

In sum, ""it is a very chancie procedure, and elimination occurs along every step of the way""

[next he talks about ""when does life begin"" according to various cultures] 

Some examples:

• after infant mortality, that is, after a person has surpassed the point where it is most likely to die

• From the Milani of West Africa, Nigeria: after 7 days, an infant is considered a life 

• the Navajo in America don't consider the child to be a ""life"" until the child laughs for the first tine

• some believe life begins with movement
**""The point is that cultures have a different take on when life begins; since life is a cycle, they have this right, because where it begins is arbitrary""**

•""Even within culture, the take on where life begins is very different"" for example, he says his friends (obstetricians and gynecologists) believe life begins at implantation, when the embryo attaches to the uterine wall. 

•He also says neonatologists often argue that the start of life is when the baby becomes viable 

• **He says neurologists (he is a neurobiologist, and agrees with this point) believe that a life begins when it has some mental capacity. This might mean motor response, brain waves, the ability to sense something, or when it can feel pain. He says only by the 7th month are the neuro-pathways able to send this information to the cortex, but there is no evidence that the cortex even does anything with this information.**

He says all science can do explain the process of development; it cannot decide, nor does it care, when people believe ""life"" truly begins. 


**[he goes on to talk about how the law has to define murder] ""The law likes a bright-white line, so that it is clear to everybody when you have crossed this line."" Since there is much debate from the point of fertilization to birth, the clearest line is at or near birth. No one will argue this point, and thus it is the most obvious answer in the eyes of the law.**


[next he chooses to talk about biblical definitions of life] 

The old testament: He says God created man in his image, and the first life he create was a full grown man, not a baby. 

The new testament: Says nothing about when life begins. The new testament and the roman empire coexisted, and at this time abortion was not uncommon.

The sixth commandment: thou shall not kill. What does this mean? The testament explains how to handle various situations (can I kill my slave, a thief, etc) and describes a scenario where a man beats another mans pregnant wife resulting in here miscarriage. The suggested way of handling this situation is to decide, in front of a judge, an appropriate monetary amount for compensation; this is the same as how cases of stolen property where handled. However, if further injury to the mother occurs, they may ""take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth"". He claims that this is very revealing that the miscarriage is not considered murder, and the inclusion of the word ""tooth"", automatically excluded a fetus or baby from person hood. 





He finishes off by explaining how the concept of ""soul"" formed from Aristotle's interpretation of how life began. Aristotle believed the mother provided the genetic material, but the father (with his sperm), provided the soul. Finally, at the discovery of fertilization (1840s) the concept of a ""soul"" was still imbedded in our society. Thus, when we discovered the point at which the human began to form, we naturally believed this fetus had a soul. **The modern day belief that a fetus is ""new life"" worthy of rights and so on is either a certainty by religious pro-lifers (because it has a soul) or it is a lingering assumption by secular pro-lifers who have it ingrained in their minds (even subconsciously) that it is, in a sense, sacred, simply because it belongs to the human species.**",1491086913,12,2017-04-01 18:48:33

I am conducting some research on the relationship between the Pro-Choice and Pro-Life movements in the US, and I would love your feedback. I am essentially studying how each group feels about the other group, and how these relations influence policy work in regards to abortion. How do you feel about the Pro-Life movement? What frustrates you, and what do you wish Pro-Life supporters understood better?

I believe a better understanding of the dynamic between these two (often incredibly polarized) groups can contribute to more cooperative work when it comes to the creation of policy and activism in the US.  If you agree or disagree, I would also love to hear what you have to say.

387,What are your thoughts on this pro-choice argument?,5,True,"In addition to the personhood argument, this is the pro-choice argument which I am tempted to view as the best one; basically, it's a four-point argument:

1. As a general rule, killing someone in self-defense is morally justifiable.
2. Existence *isn't* worse than non-existence.
3. Thus, conceiving an embryo/fetus (and thus shifting its state from non-existence to existence) *shouldn't* generate any obligation towards this embryo/fetus on your part.
4. Thus, killing this embryo/fetus in self-defense (via abortion) is morally justifiable.

Any thoughts on this? After all, I am tempted to view this argument as more convincing that a straight-up ""bodily autonomy is/should be absolute"" argument (which even I myself *don't* fullyaccept).",1489524675,30,2017-03-14 16:51:15
390,"The ""forced organ donation"" argument backfires.",3,True,"I'm the kind of person who analyzes arguments in favor of the things I support to make sure they're sound. I found the forced organ donation argument compelling for awhile. However, after giving it more thought, I found that it seems to backfire. By backfire I mean it would actually be an argument that helps anti choicers.    
    
Before I give my reasons I'll give the forced donation argument for those who are unfamiliar. It says that we are not allowed to force a woman to donate an organ to her dying child. Therefore we cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term to save the life of the fetus or zygote. Now I'll give my argument for why it backfires.  To be clear though I'll only be referring to consensual sex here.   
    
Imagine that you, of your own free will, decide to engage in an activity. In carrying out this activity you damage my liver to the point where I need an organ transplant. You are the only person capable of donating to me in time. It is true that no one can force you to do it, but if I die you would likely be charged with some form of negligence resulting in death, or manslaughter.    
    
Now consider pregnancy in light of my analogy above. A woman freely decides to engage in sex, and as a result she gets pregnant. No one can force her to carry to term, but terminating the pregnancy would be a crime. This is because, like my earlier example, the fetus needing her organs to survive is a direct result of a free action taken by the woman.    
    
The anti choicers could argue that the fetus needing your organs would be no different than if you accidentally damaged my liver. While you can't be forced to donate an organ you can still be charged with a crime if the person dies because you were directly responsible for them needing the organ(s) to survive.     
    
This is the reason why I decided it's a bad argument because using it actually gives ammunition to those who wish to criminalize abortion. Thoughts?",1489110698,42,2017-03-09 20:51:38

413,So I just tried to have a conversation with a pro-lifer...,23,True,"...and it went way worse than expected.

I say ""conversation"", but it was via IM. I messaged a woman asking her what she thought of a story recently posted on here about a man who lost his wife in childbirth because they chose not to have an abortion despite knowing how dangerous her condition was (a choice which was very much influenced by aggressive protesters at planned parenthood pushing the idea that abortion is always murder).  I simply asked the woman whether after reading that story she still felt that it is ""always"" murder. 

She wouldn't even read it, at all. She simply accused me of trying to ""swindle"" her, refused to even have a calm conversation about it, and started saying I was ""probably one of those baby killers too"". She completely flipped on me, and I was as absolutely polite the entire time. I never even told her my own beliefs, I simply asked her a question. 

I'm just very frustrated that people like her are running around loudly proclaiming anyone who believes in pro choice or even supports planned parenthood is a ""baby killer"". It's just nothing but negativity and violence with a complete inability to even try and talk things out. If she wants to convince people of her point of view, I would gladly chat with her, but instead she chooses to spam Facebook with proclamations in both her comments and posts of ""DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD"" and ""ABORTION IS MURDER"". She even said, and I quote, ""Why are you trying to change my way of thinking so I will supporting ripping babies legs and arms and crushing their skull"" ""This is how they do abortions. Watch silent scream""

I'm just infuriated. She puts no thought into the things she's spewing, she just repeats what others have told her. Argh.

417,When is not getting an abortion still murder?,39,True,"I'm confused about the whole idea of abortion and the debate around it. 
A year ago right now my wife and I found out that she had a genetically inherited disease and an autoimmune disease. We were 11 weeks pregnant. One of the concerns were that A she couldn't carry to term, her body couldn't physically support the weight. B that if she made it to term labor could cause her heart to rupture and she'd bleed out before anything could be done. In situation A sometime in the second trimester her cervix would fail(no option to stitch it closed) and our baby would slide out. Situation B meant she'd would make it to term but when labor started she would die but baby would survive most likely. 

So here we faced a choice of potential devastating loss when grocery shopping or I get to be a single father. We had the talk several times about abortion. It's difficult to have a conversation about choosing my wife or my unborn when one is called murder and the other life saving. Why would it be ok to abort to save my wife? Wouldn't it be murder/suicide for us to proceed? Additionally there is a risk that the baby would have what she has and be faced with the same situation later in life. Why would one choice be morally superior to the other? What would you choose? I understand the this is a unique situation and definitely non typical but everything I could read on the pro choice side told me that I was facing a choice to terminate a life. That life starts at conception. That I knew the consequences. That I was going to murder, murder, someone. I assure you I didn't know. Our choice was to try to have a child. Our choice was to raise a child in a loving home which we could provide. Our choice was to love something more than ourselves. Our choice wasn't to face something so horrific as a deciding who survives this. 

Situation A gave us a scare when her cervix started thinning but fortunately stopped and pregnancy continued 

Situation B was still a major threat as we proceeded. I watched as her belly grew and spoke to our son. I would lay in bed and drag my fingers through my wife's hair and watch as she gazed at him moving inside her belly. We laughed as we through out names. I watched as her body changed. I would lay awake a memorize every detail of her face as she slept. I woke up early to make her breakfast. I carried everything and followed her instructions as she began to nest and prepare our home. There is nothing more precious and dear to our experience than witness a woman becoming a mother. 

A c-section wasn't optional due to how her body healed if she would survive it anyways. So we made or plans and prepared. At 11 pm she came and told me her water broke. We followed our plan exactly. She was unable to get an epidural due to degenerative vertebrae. We waited and spoke as labor set it. Two hours in I was speaking to her telling her she could do this when it happened. I watch as her eyes rolled back and chest went still. I watched completely motionless as they pulled my son from my wife's motionless body. When they handed him to me all I could was her face, her nose, her chin, her eyes. The greatest day of my life wasn't vibrant it was pale and grey. I sat holding my son that will never know his mother's smile and embrace. 

You might be asking why did we continue and I assure you I ask myself this every waking moment. It's because she was so convinced that abortion is murder. When we went to the clinic people yelled that we were killing our baby and my wife forced us to leave. Yes, it was her choice. But I will not call it a sacrifice. She was scared . It was fear and reteric that in the end removed her choice. So I'm here, I have a five month old son, my wife is gone. There is compelling arguments on both sides of this debate but there is a resonibility in how we address it. Guilt, shame, and fear robbed my family. We could have gotten an abortion and adopted. I love my son. I loved my wife. Someone please explain why abortion would have been murder. Why isn't it murder to those people who yelled at us that we were killing our baby?

448,"Roe V Wade isn't about abortion, let me tell you why",17,True,"According to the court documents, a doctor involved who asked to be included in litigation; one James Hubert Hallford, supported this ruling because he believed the state was violating his rights as a licensed physician.

 Before you say it, I'm aware the contents of the court case involved a woman seeking abortion rights, talked in depth about abortion and gave various rulings specific to abortion.

 What people often fail to acknowledge though is that the most important part of the ruling itself has nothing to do with abortion.

 The highlight of the case was not about the freedom to have an abortion, it was instead regarding the powers a state has to intervene on decisions between a doctor and patient.

Dr. Hallford claimed ""they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments."" Ultimately he was deemed to not be suitable for the case, but his concerns were addressed by the ruling.

 So take a step back and try to fully grasp the complexity of this ruling.

 Yes, it granted women the right to have an abortion. But more importantly it made it clear that decisions regarding medical procedure are between a doctor and patient, and shall not be abridged or made public by the state unless there is a risk to public health at large.

To quote an exert from the judicial summary
 *""The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention.""*

If Roe V Wade is overturned, it's a foothold for state mandated medical involvement.

 All it would take is a group making a compelling argument regarding a medical procedure to take away your rights.

* It could mean banning/enforcing vaccinations based on public opinion, for the sake of the child in both cases.

* It could mean banning contraceptive surgeries such as vasectomies or IUDs because it hampers the possibility of an egg being fertilized.

* It could mean the state can install electronic chips inside of you because your physical health becomes a matter of public concern.

* It could mean making public a list indicating the STD status and history of all members of the public.

* It could mean an imposed civic duty to be an organ and blood donor unless deemed deferred for reasons relating to spiritual belief or disease.

I'm going down a slippery slope here; I have faith in the supreme court's wisdom to not completely screw over the American people like that. I mean, people are reasonable, right? No judge in their right mind, in respect to the constitution, would rule that you have no right to privacy and control over your own body and life, right?

And this is coming from someone who will never get an abortion and who hasn't eaten meat for 8ish years.

So many people are quick to dismiss vegans as irrational and annoying for trying to impose their beliefs on meat eaters, while at the same time being pro-life. The parallels between the vegan arguments and the pro-life arguments are strikingly similar. Even the tactics vegan activists use to promote their cause are similar such as protesting certain organizations, posting uncomfortable pictures of livestock being abused, and/or posting guilt-inspiring posts that attack morality.  

Sure you could argue, ""It's different, one is an *animal* the other is a *baby*"" but try telling that to a vegan and they will completely disagree and argue that all animals are equal and deserve the same rights as humans. 

Now my question to any pro-lifers would be this:
How would you feel if the government decided that animal consumption was unconstitutional and took away your right to eat meat?

I'm gonna assume you would probably not be too happy about it, and that is why when it comes to consuming meat we are left with an easy solution: If you don't agree with eating meat, don't eat meat.

463,"I am pro-choice, but there is one thing about the pro-choice philosophy that concerns me.",0,True,"It is that it seems to crucially rest on a presumption that a parent has no moral obligation for the welfare of their child.

Yes, you can make the argument that a fetus relies on its mother's body to survive, and so the mother can choose to cease lending the use of her organs to the fetus at any stage. But if we are to concede this, don't we also have to conclude that no parent has any obligation to look after or nurture their child? Why would the same philosophy not apply once the child is born?

It seems that forcing a parent to provide for a young child is just as much an infringement on bodily autonomy and liberty than forcing a mother to carry a fetus to term, if that goes against the parents will. If a parent does not wish to expend effort into caring for their baby, should they not be allowed to let it starve and die?

Of course, in society we accept that a parent is by default given responsibility over their child, and so any parent who did such a thing would be charged with negligence and deemed a monster. 

But it seems somewhat inconsistent that the same legal expectation of responsibility is not given to a fetus, and instead the fetus is treated as a complete stranger which the mother has absolutely no obligation towards. I'm finding it hard to reconcile the two.

482,"Pro-life and Pro-choice are not equal, and women have the advantage on both sides already.",0,True,"Pro-life and Pro-choice are not equal, and women have the advantage on both sides already.

In Pro-life, a woman who had consensual sex with a man becomes pregnant, and she decides to have the child. The man however, didn't intend to get the woman pregnant, and doesn't want the child to be born. He is not ready to accept the responsibilities of being a father. The woman will have the child, because by law it is her body. She will gain most/all parental rights. Additionally, she'll seek child support for 18 years, and the man will pay for what he considers a ""mistake"" for 18 years. Rightfully so. The father of the child should have been more careful if he didn't want a child at the time.

In Pro-choice, a woman who had consensual sex with the man becomes pregnant, and she decides not to have the child. The man however, does, even though he didn't intend to get the woman pregnant. He is ready to accept the responsibilities of being a father. The woman will have the abortion, because by law it is her body. After all, it was just a mistake, and she is not ready to accept the responsibilities of a child. Maybe next time. However, the man who dreamt of being a father the moment he discovered she was pregnant, has lost his baby.

A child is neither solely a woman's or solely a man's responsibility. A child, born or unborn, is both's responsibility, and so both their RIGHT to raise them when one or the another wants to or not.

TRUE Equal Rights: 
- If a woman has the right to an abortion, even when a man wants the child, then a man has the right to an abortion, even when a woman wants the child.
- If a woman has the right to keep the child, even when a man does not, then a man has the right to keep the child, even when a woman does not.

I'm sixteen and I don't really track politics, but it catches my eye every time I see something as abortion or gay rights and such, so I find this article that gave me chills. So, apparently, in Croatia abortion is legal if the pregnancy lasts up to 10 weeks, afterwards women are required to face a commitee which will decide whether they will allow it. BUT, the worst part is yet to come. What 70% of gynecologists in Croatia do, is exercise their right to ""refuse service of adoption due to religious, moral and ethical disagreement."" They are obligated to refer them to another doctor which will fulfill their request. Unfortunately, that is almost always a private practitioner which will charge twice as much as it usually costs (about 2000 kuna, in private clinics up to 4000-5000, which is about 500$... That's minimum wage around here...). And the government which is now in office is encouraging a law which will force women to see a priest, rabbi and such, depending on their stated religion if any. Otherwise they would have to see a psychologist, just to make sure. Not to mention that these women will probably be fired from their jobs. Abortion in this country is such a tabu, that anyone who has done it is viewed practically as a criminal. It'd be super awesome if someone saw this article and raised awareness of this in the EU or something, because we don't have it as bad as some others do (in Malta, abortion justifies arrest and imprisonment).

Today we discussed abortion in class, but he made it very clear that there would be no debate. Instead, he asked us each to write down two reasons we support pro-life or pro-choice views and turn them in anonymously to be read back to the class. (My reasons for supporting pro-choice were back-alley abortions and bodily autonomy).

Now interestingly,  he provided very unbiased commentary as he read them aloud. He was clearly not ignorant, and he described different bodily anatomy and talked about aborting a preganancy from blastocyst to embryo to fetus. He mentioned that the answer to where life begins is ""subjective"" and that he believed it started very early (did not specify anymore). He did not disaprove of anyone, and simply stated he was pro-life again without trying to persuade us.

""That's your decision to make"". He said

""I'm not going to make it for you"".

The rest of class, we watched a documentary about a girl named [Becky Bell] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Bell)

She refused to tell her conservative parents she was pregnant and couldn't apply for a legal abortion with telling them, so she received a back alley abortion and died of infection. 

I was very impressed by the very unbiased way this information was taught, especially considering horror stories I have heard about other schools.

442,How I went from being pro-life to pro-choice,33,True,"I didn’t even want to have sex in the first place but she pressured me so compellingly over those first few months of college, of infatuation and sexual awakening.  I was so wrapped up in her I could feel the thirteen years of Catholic schooling bending to her indomitable will.  That’s why I bought the condoms, which is a terrible embarrassment for any Catholic.  The great Catholic paradox of sexuality: you shouldn’t have sex outside of marriage, but if you do, you sure as fuck shouldn’t get someone pregnant, but if you do, you best put abortion out of your mind, but also don’t wear condoms.  I’d love to know how many abortions were a result of Catholics avoiding condoms.

But I wasn’t thinking about any of that when I bought the condoms.  I bought them out of fear of my own weakness and lack of self-control.  No Catholic wants to go through the shame of an unwanted pregnancy, but she's not Catholic.

It wasn’t a day later when she pulled me close for the umpteenth time and talked to me in ways no woman ever had before.  This time my scruples were awash with alcohol and I laughed out-loud at the ridiculousness of sweating for years over such a simple and obvious act.  Twenty years of church and thirteen years of school don’t often stand up to a million years of evolution.  Human nature most often wins.

Were she to become pregnant, she'd abort the baby, I'm sure.  It would mean sacrificing her life and career in order to give this child a life of considerably less than she will be able to offer a child in the future as a Stanford graduate, etc, etc.

“So you believe that abortion is morally wrong?” she asks, in her gentlest tone.

“Yes, I do.""

“And if you could, you would require me to adopt instead of abort?”

“I never thought I’d get a woman pregnant, but I’d say that I’d request you carry the child to term.  I can’t demand it - you have rights in the matter.”

“I should think so, thanks.  But if it were up to you, no abortion?”

“Perhaps in cases where the fetus is certain to be misshapen or die quickly and the mother’s life is a stake, but I don’t like that people use abortion as a form of birth control.  That, to me, is distinctly immoral.”

She was quiet for a moment, a very long moment.

“Do you believe it’s your prerogative to relegate your belief on abortion across all the people of our nation?”

Now I am quiet. No, I do not belief I have the right to relegate my beliefs across an entire nation, especially one founded upon the ideals freedom.

The shame I felt at that moment was eventually overwhelmed by a pride in the knowledge that, given a strong enough argument, I was capable to changing my deepest convictions.

When's the last time you changed a major conviction?

After all, it's certainly *not* as ""reasonable foreseeable"" (in comparison to pregnancy) that one's *already born* child will need a new body part (such as a kidney) in order to survive *and* that you will be the only person in the world who is capable of giving a matching body part to your child.

2. Hammer pro-lifers on the personhood issue; for instance, ask pro-lifers whether they support charging doctors who destroy extra embryos which were conceived through IVF with manslaughter.

3. Hammer pro-lifers on the fact that they are applying ""special rules"" in regards to things such as pregnancy; after all, even if tort law allowed bodily compensation (and embryos/fetuses were actually capable of suing in tort law), there would be *absolutely no* case in favor of forcing a pregnant woman to remain pregnant and to allow an embryo/fetus to use her body in order to survive.

I was particularly caught be the statistic that 15% of pregnancies involve life-threatening complications.  Has anyone seen that statistic anywhere else?

When this article was posted before, the conversation included a denial that people consider pregnancy itself to be a violation/or in warlike terms.  Perhaps this is because most people don't know pregnancy all that well.

I am pregnant right now (13 weeks) and feel the war with every episode of vomiting.  The fact that I am choosing it matters very much to me.   If I weren't choosing it, it would absolutely be a violation.  But I am choosing it, and so it is curious and profound and wild.

The waters get murkier when talking about when specific procedures like D&E (or the controversial and much discussed  D&X) are performed. Emotions run high and a balanced discussion is almost impossible to find about these.

For such a hot-button issue such as abortion, I am sure a lot of studies have been conducted over the years and it would be great if someone could link some of them (in the US or elsewhere). Unlike a lot of facets of the abortion debate that are very subjective, this is one which may be effectively settled by numbers.

429,How to tell if you are dealing with a CPC or a legitimate clinic?,14,True,"I have noticed in my state and in the area I live in that there are many operations known as ""Crisis Pregnancy Centers"" (which my state gives funding for). A crisis pregnancy center is a building that is designed to look like a legitimate reproductive health clinic. They have many tactics:
-they advertise 'health services' like pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and 'counseling'
-staff wear lab coats or scrubs to look like they have medical training when most don't
-They often set up shop near a legitimate clinic or in a medical business plaza (sometimes they are in the same building or business plaza)

Now, I understand that not all CPC's are inherently bad, but most of them at best have a very strong bias. They are known to give inaccurate information about pregnancy, birth control, abortion, and child care. But at the same time, not all of them are extreme. 

Anyways, in my city specifically as well as at least one neighboring city, they each have at least one center I suspect is a CPC. I am considering calling them sometime and asking them some questions to learn more about them. I feel as someone who has the capability of becoming pregnant, I have a right to knowing as much as I can about all resources and what to look out for if someone tries to take advantage of that. 

With this in mind:
-What questions should I ask them?
-If they do appear to be one of these places, what can I do to get the word out?

I have only been inside one crisis pregnancy center before. It was in my hometown when I was in high school. I had to do volunteer hours for a class and decided to do some hours there, because I was led to believe they were something they're not. This center that I will not name for privacy concerns has zero medical staff, doesn't discuss birth control at all (when most of their 'clients' need it clearly), not even info on another place to go. They get state funding but their practices incorporate religion in a way that didn't sit well with me (you're not supposed to use government money to fund religious groups). They recently changed the name of their center, but it's the same building, people, and advertising. Anyways, hope I can get some insight on this.

**Update: Thank you everyone who has responded and to anyone else who chooses to respond to this. As for how far I would take this, I'm not sure. I did make a yelp review for a cpc in my hometown (wont say location or name due to privacy concerns) and may do so for this one. I've also thought about looking into google reviews as those often show up as well. I may write to the newspaper or use social media. My only reservation is I worry that revealing my identity may have a negative impact on me. I want to evaluate my options and see how much the methods that require my identity being fully out there can make an impact. I think it is important that women know the truth about people like this because I think it is horrible that they are being manipulated and on the taxpayers dime nonetheless.

My name is Kate, and I’m an undergraduate student working with my advisor in the College of Public Health at The Ohio State University. I’m conducting an institution-approved research study for my thesis project to better understand women’s experiences in seeking contraception (pills, condoms, IUDs, shots, etc.) or abortion care. I’m confidentially interviewing women who are at least 18 years old and who tried to get contraception services or abortion care in the last two years but were turned away because of the personal views of the provider (doctor, nurse, pharmacist, receptionist, etc.)

The interview will take about 20-45 minutes to complete. You won’t have to give me your name, and I will keep your responses confidential. I will give three months of Reddit gold (value of $7.98) to all eligible women who complete the interview to compensate for your time. 

This is a really exciting opportunity to tell your story and ultimately help other women access the reproductive health care services they need. To learn more about my project, please private message me at kolsfu_10.

I don't really see any logic behind this other than that the baby will be in her body for a few months. It's the baby's life and it should have the right to that life and the right to take it away if it so wishes. It is her baby but the baby isn't *hers*, if you know what I mean.

441,Pro-Life - Looking to start a peaceful and informative exchange between peoples of all beliefs!,0,True,"Hi all!

Before I begin, I would like to *stress* that I mean absolutely no disrespect with any questions or statements I make. 

Perhaps the best way to begin is explain a little bit about myself; I am a male, freshman in college, Catholic, type-1 diabetic, and pro-life. Also relevant, I currently have an internship with a local organization, which strives *peacefully* and prayerfully bring an end to abortion in Missouri. We do **not** yell, accuse, guilt, shame, demonize, harass, or in any way ensue conflict with Planned Parenthood or any of their clients. We simply wish to provide women with alternative, **free** resources. Certainly, many of you understand that an abortion is hardly ever a women's first choice; our job is to help these women, who are struggling through any number of life issues, understand that abortion is not their *only* choice, and to also pray for these woman, children, and their families. 

Here is my main reason for posting:

Today I realized that pro-choicers are not evil. In fact, I would argue that many are not necessarily huge fans of abortions, but simply believe that a woman should have the option to seek help to make an informed decision that is best for her. In some sense, pro-life (at least, my experience with it) and pro-choice are not so different (sans abortion views). Truly, we both just seek to provide women with care, love, support, and resources. However, the divide over abortion leads me to speculate: what are your beliefs? Is there an alternative to abortion? Do any of you wish to see an end to abortion? I would love to read detailed and well-thought out responses and to hear anyone's views. 

Just to begin the debate, here are my thoughts:

I would very much prefer to avoid being to black/white, but I do not think I can beat around the bush - simply put, I do not think that abortion should be legal. Of course there are extraordinary circumstances, such as rape, incest, threat to woman's life, etc. As a Catholic, I believe that each and every one of these scenarios can be overcome, but only though generous acts of love and support. Adoption is always a viable option for instances of unforeseen pregnancies; there are countless organizations that will walk women all the way through their pregnancy and offer resources and support, and continue to provide assistance post-birth. Likewise, as a Catholic, I believe that the purpose of sex is to be an act of love and openness to the creation of new life. So, in response to situations of mother's health being at risk, I have found the following quote from the Diocese of Phoenix 

""We may never perform an intrinsically evil act even to bring about a great good. For example, a just society cannot intentionally kill innocent civilians in a war, even for the praiseworthy goal of ending a conflict quickly and saving many lives. Likewise, in the context of pregnancy, a woman may not be killed in order to save the life of her child, and a child may not be killed in order to save the life of his mother. However, the Church does permit morally neutral medical procedures designed to save a pregnant woman’s life that may have an unintended side-effect of causing a child to die in the womb, such as the removal of a cancerous uterus. ""

I believe abortion is a great moral issue we face. However, I also realize that it is the effect of underlying causes in our society. As my own personal belief, I have come to conclude that society has de-sanctified the value and sacredness that comes with sex. Modern culture presses the idea that sex is the greatest good in life, and that it is something that can simply ""be had"" in order to satisfy an urge (like eating a sandwich to alleviate hunger). When sex is thought of in this context, it entirely removes the biological components of sex - to procreate. Man seems to think he can control how he was made through artificial contraceptives; while effective, they can never be guaranteed to work, which gives rise to issues when an ""unwanted"" pregnancy occurs. Engaging in a sexual relation with one's mind and heart set out for only pleasure, and no regards for the awesome power and potential of life, is wrong (in my eyes). It comes to violate the biological purposes of sex. Here is a good analogy I once heard - think of sex in a similar fashion to eating. Consider the two sides to eating (and sexual relations) - biological (nutrition/to procreate) and for pleasure (food taste good/to express an act of love). Let's say we eat a salad. The salad is packed with vitamins and healthful benefits, and satisfies the biological side of eating ( to acquire nutrients and energy), while perhaps not entirely satisfying the pleasurable side. Now, take the action of eating a doughnut. There is very little biological reason (maybe it will fill you up a bit, but there are hardly any nutrients present), but you certainly get more pleasure from eating the doughnut than the salad. What's the idea here? Both acts consisted of eating, but for different motives. Eating the doughnut was to experience pleasure, and less for biological reasons, **but** the biological reasons were not shut out. Indeed, even in eating the doughnut, some nutrition was able to be digested. We were still *open* to the potential nutrition in the doughnut. Sexual relations are similar; sometimes we may want to express love for one another, and that's okay! We just must still be open to the awesome potential and possibility of new life. Failure to do so would violate the biological component. 

Ultimately, I pray for a world in which everyone can come to love one another, despite differences in beliefs. As humans, we all have an inherent dignity and right to life! As a society, we should be focused upon supporting and promoting the common good. To everyone reading, I apologize for the wall of text! Person of faith or not, God bless you, and thank you for taking the time to read! I'd love to have a thoughtful discussion and exchange result from this. I'm hoping everyone, regardless of beliefs, feels comfortable and welcome sharing their thoughts here! ",1477081035,58,2016-10-21 16:17:15
442,"Former pro-lifer, currently on the fence. Help me with a question.",25,True,"Hi, everyone! I was pro-life for most of my life, but now I'm on the fence. I changed my opinion on abortion when I realized a few things:

1) I never felt like women who've had abortions should be in jail (like, ""Omg, call the cops and get that woman off the streets!""). In fact, I usually had sympathy for them.

2) People who are pro-choice are not baby killers out for blood. In fact, most of them love children, and most of them hate abortion (they just think a woman should allowed to decide whether to carry the baby to term).

3) There's a lot of ambiguity as to when exactly life starts, so abortion isn't a black and white issue. For example, I never thought taking the morning after pill should be considered an abortion.

But I'm still on the fence (i.e. haven't decided to be pro-choice) because I have a hard time not seeing abortion as killing. What are your thoughts?

For the record, even when I was pro-life, I supported comprehensive sex education, free birth control, welfare for low-income mothers, and adoption.",1477063965,65,2016-10-21 11:32:45
446,Another perspective - abortion as pro-child,21,True,"I originally posted this idea on the [antinatalism subreddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/) and thought it might be relevant here as well.  I've re-written this substantially so it's accessible to people who don't know about the the antinatalist philosphy.  
-------
I walked by a pro-choice and anti-abortion campaign today. The pro-choice side had signs like, ""keep your ideology off women's bodies"" and ""women's bodies, women's choices."" The anti-abortion side had the usual signs of bloody aborted fetus and said stuff like, ""what about the rights of the child?""

It made me realize that even pro-choicers are going about this abortion issue the wrong way when they they go the route of ""women's right to her body above the rights of the child.""   Abortion is not the right of the women versus the right of the child.  Don't make the mistake of letting the pro-lifers talk for the unborn and claim that anti-abortion views are about preserving the rights of the child.  

Abortion can be very pro-child.  You're preventing a child from becoming a wage slave, cannon fodder, a potential victim of many horrors, the list goes on.  There is a lot of suffering that goes on in this world that your child will never have the chance of undergoing.  Abortion can be a kindness to the unborn.  (And if you ask an antinatalist, we'll tell you that abortion is always a kindness.  But this subreddit is pro-choice and about your choices :)  Just giving you a different perspective here.) 

So yeah, instead of the pro-choice being all about women's right and women's right, and the pro-lifer's side being all ""what about the child????"", pro-choicers should show that they too are just as, if not more pro-child than the pro-lifers are.  ",1476928123,6,2016-10-19 21:48:43

There are some options.

1) Rape
I do not feel a child should be born through rape. That is an abomination.

2) Mother is too sick has cancer and won't be able to go through with the pregnancy.

3) Child can cause mother death.

I'm fine with those three, but not being responsible and getting impregnated is not a good enough reason to destroy a human being's right to existence.

The abortion logic sounds good until you get into the details.

When exactly is it not ok to kill the fetus anymore.

Do squirrels and animals have more rights than a fetus, what about an ant? What level is a fetus on in the grand scheme of things?

I got that it is treated differently from other medical issues but pregnancy is a uniquely female experience so it was hard for me to think of a counterexample to that really distilled the sexism involved. Recently, I did come up with one that helped me better understand the double standard regarding autonomy:

If you are in a hospital and a child next to you is dying of renal failure a doctor cannot force you to give up a kidney to save the child. In fact, unless you are an organ donor, you could die on the spot and the doctors would still not be able to take your kidney. Even if the child is your child, your responsibility, the state has no power to go in and force you to give up a kidney to try and save your child.

452,"I think abortion is only right when the child will be born with a problem, and when the mother was raped or won't live through the process.",0,True,"   I was pro-choice since today. I came upon a discussion that made me think about it and I came to a conclusion. Abortion is only acceptable if at least one of the criteria above is met. I don't think excuses like ""They are too young!"" or ""The condom broke!"" are valid. Pregnancy is part of sex, they knew what they were getting to, it's their responsibility.  
  
   Imagine that someone ate McDonalds burgers everyday. The consumer knew what he was getting into, but the person made exercise to avoid dying. The burger eater manages to avoid obesity thanks to exercise, but the sandwich devourer still gets a fuck-ton of health problems because they are part of the food, yet the the now McDonalds hater goes and complains about it.

454,Looking for responses: Violinist Argument,6,True,"I was recently going over some old CMV posts and found a critique of the Violinist argument. According to the author, there's a difference between letting someone die and deliberately killing them. He sources that line from Batman Begins (*I won't kill you but I don't have to save you*) to go along with his point. I have two responses to this but I'd like to hear more.

The first is that by his own logic, he should be ok with any first trimester abortion. They don't deliberately kill the fetus, they just detach it from the uterus or stop providing food and nutrients to it. It then dies on its own, just like the Violinist. Thus even if he had a point, the majority of abortions would still be legally justified (since most happen within the first trimester).

The second is that both the pregnant woman and the person attached to the Violinist *aren't* third parties to the situation, so neither scenario is like the line in Batman Begins. If the only way to remove yourself from the Violinist was to directly kill him, would it be murder then? If someone was coming at me to chop my fingers off (which won't kill me), and the only way to prevent that was for me to kill them, would I not be justified in making my desire to remain with an unaltered body a higher priority than the other person's life?

**A woman aborting a pregnancy doesn't affect you at all.**
> Only if abortion isn't murder.

**Why do you think women should carry pregnancies they don't want? Ex. If they can't afford a(nother) child.**
>There's a risk of pregnancy when sex occurs and there's no excuse to avoid the consequences of their actions. (When asked ""You just want ""whores"" to get ""punished"" don't you?"" he gets offended and says he doesn't hate women.)

**What about pregnancies from incest or rape? Women don't choose to be raped and shouldn't deal with the trauma of giving birth to their rapist's child.**
> Incest isn't an excuse. For rape... I don't know, but I would still urge for her to keep the baby. (Later backpedaled when I reminded him the meaning of ""urge"" and he said that he would ""keep his opinion to himself."")

**If a couple uses as much protection as possible but still get pregnant, they should still be responsible for it?**
> Yes.

**Is a life living in foster home from foster home and feeling unwanted really better than Heaven? (He said he believes aborted fetuses go to Heaven when they die).**
> Yes.

**The only exception for abortion in his opinion is if the pregnancy would kill the mother.**

**What if: A child will be born with a severe disability and need medical care and attention 24/7?**
> I know it's difficult, but it's still a consequence. That child doesn't deserve to die just because the parents don't want to take care of it.

**When asked why his opinion about other people's bodies matter, he says that he's against murder and suggests that I want murder to be legal.**

**Abortion being illegal isn't going to stop women from using coat hangers, etc.**
> Murder being illegal doesn't stop murderers.

**""You're bigoted.""**
> This may surprise you, but I donate to an orphanage often and am about to adopt (even though according to you, the child I adopt doesn't deserve life.) (NOT AN ARROGANT BRAGGART, GUYS.)

**Countless times he goes on about how he loves women and ""I'd be pro-choice buuut""... but he doesn't respect their choice to have an abortion.**

**""You have no sympathy, caring more about potential people than living people.**
> You seem like someone who would rush over to a couple who just had a miscarriage and congratulate them. And if they got upset, you would call them retards for being so emotional.

480,Thoughts about this (very simple) pro-choice argument?,4,True,"Basically, I have previously had similar thoughts but (unfortunately) didn't articulate them as clearly as I am currently doing. Indeed, here goes:

(For the record, I consider the ""bodily autonomy"" argument to be an intellectually lazy argument; plus, even I don't believe that bodily autonomy should be some kind of ""holy cow."")

Since it is *not* the pregnant woman's fault that her embryo/fetus is unable to survive without the use of this pregnant woman's body (rather, this is the fault of biology), the pregnant woman certainly *shouldn't* be legally required to allow her embryo/fetus to continue using her body.

Indeed, the only thing that a pregnant woman is responsible for is the existence for this embryo/fetus. However, causing someone to exist certainly shouldn't justify being required to provide additional assistance to this person (such as by being required to allow this person to use one's body). After all, this is similar to saying that if I extend someone's life by giving this person one of my kidneys, I should also be legally required to donate, say, blood or bone marrow to this person at some later point in time if this person will (as a result of biology) develop additional health problems and will need my blood or bone marrow in order to survive. Indeed, I simply caused this person to continue existing--I certainly did *not* cause this person to develop a need for a blood donation or for a bone marrow donation.

Also, in regards to the ""throwing a person off of your boat"" scenario, *even if* I accepted the premise that a boat can be compared with one's body, there is a relevant difference between this scenario and pregnancy. Indeed, if you invite someone (as in, someone who *cannot* swim) onto your boat and then change your mind and want to throw this person overboard, you certainly *shouldn't* (legally) be able to do this because it *is* your fault that this person *cannot* be removed from your boat without dying afterwards; after all, had you *not* sailed out to sea (and would have rather kept your boat anchored on land), you would have been able to remove this person from your boat without causing this person to die afterwards (after all, a person who cannot swim can certainly survive on land).

In contrast, there is *never* any way for a pregnant woman to remove an embryo/fetus from her body which *doesn't* result in the death of this embryo/fetus afterwards. Thus, pregnancy simply isn't comparable to inviting someone who cannot swim onto your boat.

Anyway, any thoughts this argument of mine and on everything that I wrote here?",1474056303,28,2016-09-16 16:05:03
481,Please help us at r/badselfeater,10,True,"Good afternoon,

I will give you the quick and dirty:
Over the last few weeks an esoteric ARG was occurring. Much intrigue mystery and suspense was involved. 

Unfortunately the reveal today was unveiled and it turns out to be an extremist group of pro-lifers calling themselves Abortion Abolitionists. Most of the redditors on this subreddit, as normal, reasonable people, were sincerely and extremely outraged that something that had nothing to do with abortion was co-opted by a group of nutjobs. Currently we are attempting to turn the sub into a pro-choice themed sub.  

As a sign of protest we have begun donated to Planned Parenthood, and are attempting to convert the sub into a prochoice arena of discussion.  

Please show your support with a simple post or upvoting related pro choice threads.  


Thanks for your time reading this.  

EDIT: if you end up opening the reveal video (it's 27 minutes and on youtube) close it, it's a crazy person spewing anti-woman pro jesus vitriol and there's a lovely segment of zoomed in abortion footage that is NSFL/NSFW.

Reddit’s Model House of Commons (a parliament simulation) has just begun voting in it’s 6th General Election and it’s open to anyone interested in voting (which is easy, fairly anonymous, and fast).

I’m asking for your vote for the Green Party because we have stood tirelessly for fair and equal elections, social justice, LGBT rights, environmentalism, economic policies focused on helping the average individual, and an intelligent foreign policy. The Green Party has elected 2 past Prime Ministers and has a strong and active showing on the Model House of Commons. We are all in favour of pro-choice and will fight back against any attempts to restrict women's reproductive rights. A vote for us is a prochoice vote.

I hope you take a brief moment of your time to help our subreddit continue to function, since we run off of the votes of the public. While it is just a simulation, this of course is very real and very enjoyable for all of us, and your time is a huge help. Every vote matters!

Please come and vote GREEN here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/4zr812/general_election_vi_megathread/

Here’s also a full link to our manifesto if you’re interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/4zregd/gevi_green_party_manifestos/

469,An argument in favor of legalized abortion.,8,True,"Basically, here is why exactly I support legalized abortion (as the law of my U.S. state and of the U.S. at large). Indeed, please keep in mind that this is an argument based on morality rather than on the U.S. Constitution (making such arguments based on the U.S. Constitution is a separate issue that I certainly *don't* want to discuss here). Anyway, here goes:

I have previously heard some pro-lifers use causation to justify forcing women to remain pregnant against their will. However, causation appears to be a principle from tort law and thus if we are going to use the causation principle we might as well use other principles from tort law as well.

Anyway, since causing someone to exist *isn't* a harm and since having consensual sex is *neither* illegal *nor* negligent, I certainly *don't* think that women should be forced to allow their embryos/fetus to use their bodies in order to survive.

However, a pro-lifer can argue that women *implicitly* consented to allowing embryos and fetuses to use their bodies by having consensual sex. The thing is, though, that even if I accept this premise, consent can be revoked. For instance, if you invite someone for dinner and then change your mind in the middle of dinner, you are perfectly entitled to kick this person out of your house. Indeed, the *only* exception that I would make to this is cases where a withdrawal of consent would result in a person being made worse off than he or she previously was. For instance, if you invite a person (even a sick person who has contagious diseases and who cannot swim) onto your boat, you certainly *shouldn't* be able to expel this person from your boat (and thus cause this person to drown and to die) in the middle of your journey. However, this example certainly *isn't* comparable to abortion because aborting a fetus *doesn't* result in a fetus being made worse off than he or she previously was. Indeed, a fetus after abortion ends up being in the *exact same* state/condition that it was before it was conceived (inside of the woman's body) in the first place; specifically, I am talking about the state/condition which is called non-existence.

Indeed, based on the principles of tort law, forcing a pregnant woman to continue her pregnancy would be a case of unjust enrichment since it would allow their embryos and fetuses to acquire more than they deserve (specifically they are able to continue using their mother's body and to suck/absorb nutrients from it).

Also, for the record, for the sake of argument, I agreed with the pro-life claim that embryos and fetuses *are* persons. However, I personally *don't* consider them to be persons and *don't* think that the law should actually consider them to be persons.

In addition to this, though, I certainly think that the pro-choice arguments of ""bodily autonomy"" and ""my body, my choice"" are intellectually lazy arguments and *far* inferior to the argument(s) that I have made here.

473,So I watched the 180 Movie the other day..,12,True,"The other day like Monday or something when my boyfriend was on campus (in Kansas), a guy handed him this tract: http://imgur.com/a/xTKpp

I was sorta bored and drinking coffee so I decided to follow the link to watch the movie because hey, maybe they could argue something I haven't heard before. Here's my thought process during the movie and if you don't want to give the YouTube page ad revenue, this is sort of a small summary. 

First minute: dramatic music, videos of Nazis and ""Hi, I'm Ray Comfort, I'm Jewish.""  Oh goodness. Banana Man. Here we go. 

Then he asks a lot of American college-age students who Adolf Hitler is. Most of them don't know - which I think is the craziest thing about this movie. He asked a guy who said 'uhhh... I don't know... he had a mustache' or 'He was a famous actor...'. 

Wait, now he's engaging with a Neo-Nazi who hates black people and Jews? What does this have to do with abortions? What is going on? Now he's talking to a Holocaust denier? I'm so confused. 

Then he talks to a Russian guy who lost his parents and aunt to WWII. Comfort asks the guy if he would kill Hitler in the womb, knowing that in the future Hitler would end up killing 6 million Jews. The Russian guy says ""immediately"" followed up with ""I'd kill her [Hitler's mother], kill him , and kill his relatives, everybody who belongs to the Hitler family"". Cue more dramatic music.

Then he goes on to ask people something along the lines of if each would personally operate a bulldozer to bury Jews alive, if a Nazi officer threatened to kill him if he didn't. But when they say no, Comfort says the Jews will die anyway if they don't bulldoze them. Then what's the point of the choice? That is no way comparable to abortion. 

He keeps repeating ""Finish the sentence for me. It's okay to kill a baby in the womb when (blank).""  

My mind kind of wandered off in the last 10 minutes of the film, I was talking about Christianity and the 10 commandments and all that. 'Thou shall not kill' to defend abortion, even though I can justify killing (self-defense for example). 

My biggest problem with this propaganda is comparing the systemic torturing, rape, enslaving, and killing of Jews to abortion. It is not comparable at all. But what else do I expect from Ray Comfort? Yes the banana is 'perfectly shaped' to fit in the human hand, but also it's perfectly designed to fit in your butt. Also selective breeding lol. 

The weirdest thing about this movie is that the crux of his entire arguments in the movie lies on the Holocaust being so horrible, he still wouldn't kill Hitler in the womb knowing that 6 million Jews would be killed if he didn't kill Hitler in the womb. I know he is being consistent with his 'value of life' thing however. To me he is saying ""Knowing that in the future, this fetus would become Hitler and kill 6 million Jews, I'd rather not kill Hitler in the womb"". 

Thought this subreddit might get a kick out of this. ",1469651439,8,2016-07-27 16:30:39
474,What do you think about men in the women's reproductive rights arguments?,11,True,"This post is US based. 

I have been struggling with this. For me, the ability to choose when a pregnancy happens is solely based in the woman's choice since it's her bodily autonomy being violated (if it's unwilled/involuntary). Currently, I see it as men cannot truly sympathize with women who choose abortion because their personal opinions will never affect them (I must clarify that it's the same with infertile women). 

In my personal experience, men display having an extreme bias towards the abortion debate, but I don't want to tell them to 'shut up and believe' because I believe it pushes possible pro-choice allies away.  I've also had plenty of men tell me they'd never get an abortion and that women who have had one should be lined up and shot. In all my conversations when I have asked what the punishment should be, not a single woman has said the punishment should be anything like that (for context I'm a college student in the Midwest so I've had many chances to engage with pro-lifers). 


So I ask you in this community, what role do you think men play in the abortion debate? I have many male friends who trust I talk to about this because I'm concerned about my rights, but they have replied that since it doesn't affect them, they barely think about it, if at all. My boyfriend is just now coming to understand why I care about this issue so much. The attempts to defund clinics genuinely scare me. 


Also apologies for confusion in wording, didn't sleep well last night. Any questions for clarifying anything are welcome.

476,Opinion/Change My View: Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned,0,True,"Frankly, this is an issue which I appear to be conflicted on. However, in spite of my own support for legalized abortion nationwide, I am becoming hesitant to say that doing this through the judiciary/courts was the right move.

Basically, while I certainly consider the arguments against legalized abortion (and forcing unwilling parents to pay child support in cases where taxpayer money isn't on the line, for that matter) to be very weak (indeed, I certainly think that it is ridiculous to impose an *involuntary* obligation on someone in response to this person doing either a *morally neutral* (such as causing a zygote/embryo to exist) or a *morally positive* action), I certainly understand why exactly even a secular, non-religious person can be politically anti-abortion. Thus, rather than legalizing abortion through the judiciary/courts, I am gradually becoming tempted to say that abortion is an issue that should have been left to the political process to deal with.

For the record, in regards to bodily autonomy, I myself have *never* considered bodily autonomy to be a ""holy cow"" (in spite of my own politically pro-choice position). Indeed, I myself have no problem with laws that, say, give convicted criminals a choice between refusing to donate their body part(s) to their (living, obviously) victims (or to another needy person in the event that there is no match with the victim's body parts) and getting more jail time or agreeing to donate their body part(s) and getting less jail time. Plus, we already *don't* fully treat bodily autonomy as a ""holy cow""--else, things such as drug use, consensual incest, consensual prostitution, et cetera would already be legal. (For the record, I myself actually *would* support using the judiciary to legalize things such as consensual incest nationwide. After all, if women who are over, say, age 35 are able to have children in spite of the apparently higher risk of birth defects, why exactly should consensual incestuous adult couples be unable to likewise have children (let alone consensual sex)?)

Basically, a problem that I have with using the courts/judiciary to legalize abortion nationwide is that while things such as drug use *indisputably* only *directly* affect *one* person, this certainly *isn't* true of abortion. (Do *I* consider non-sentient embryos and non-sentient fetuses to be persons? No, certainly not! However, I am hesitant to say that this is something that should be imposed on the entire U.S. by the courts/judiciary.) Thus, the courts/judiciary should let the various U.S. states (well, in the absence of a U.S. Constitutional amendment in regards to this, that is) make their own moral judgments in regards to whether or not a pregnant woman's bodily autonomy is superior to an embryo's/fetus's life.

Also, I would like to point out that, as far as I know, the U.S. government *can* draft unwilling people and thus force unwilling people to risk their lives, say, fighting an unprovoked war of aggression against out democratic neighbors Canada and Mexico. Indeed, in spite of my support for the doctrine of implied repeal (after all, if judges overreach, then they can simply be impeached and removed from office and then have their rulings be overturned/repealed by their replacements), I am hesitant to say that the courts/judiciary (meaning the U.S. Supreme Court) should strike down the draft in my scenario above. Likewise, I am hesitant to say that the courts/judiciary should continue to uphold Roe v. Wade. After all, in spite of my own pro-choice political views, I appear to be gradually coming to the conclusion that controversial issues that *don't* indisputably involve only *one* party should be left to the U.S. states (in the absence of a U.S. Constitutional amendment in regards to this, obviously; also, for the record, I myself would certainly *support* a U.S. Constitutional amendment which legalizes abortion nationwide in the U.S.).

482,"How to argue the pro-choice side, IMO",4,True,"I've spent a lot of time arguing about abortion, both on and off Reddit and other forums, and in my experience here is the best way to go about making the case for abortion:

First, you have to make sure they understand the issue is a ""lesser of two evils"" situation. It helps if they know that you don't particularly like abortions, that you would prefer to prevent unplanned pregnancies before they happened rather than resort to abortion. They have to understand that you feel that abortion is a ""necessary evil"" (even if you don't feel this way, it goes a LONG way toward coming to common ground and establishing credibility in the pro-life person's mind). You have to get them to see that there IS a victim on the other side... the woman who is pregnant and doesn't want to be.

Second, you must explain what it is that confers something that philosophers call ""full moral status"" (or FMS) onto a being in question. To do this first you should explain what is NOT relevant to the consideration of moral status. You must dispel with the notions that merely belonging to a species (human, DNA) is enough to confer full moral status, that being ""alive"" is relevant only as a prerequisite for that which is actually important (which I'll get to in a moment, for this I like to use the phrase ""necessary but not sufficient"". That is, being alive is necessary but not sufficient for FMS) and that things like the heart beating and having recognizable body structures (facial features, fingers and toes) are completely irrelevant to the issue and are nothing but emotional appeals. Quickly and without prejudice dispel any appeals to any subjectively defined classifications (""alive"", ""human"", etc) and explain that they are, indeed, subjectively defined human invented systems of classification and that the property which confers full moral status (which I sometimes like to call moral worth or moral consideration) is a real, objective, property that might happen to fall under one or more of those categories of things that they bring up but is not equivalent to them.

Next, explain that the property that actually matters to the application of morality is sentience. A being is sentient if it has subjective experiences. A subjective experience is an experience that is private to that being, it is something that gives that being a perspective of it's own. We do not apply morality to ANYTHING that is not sentient, and for good reason. Explain that sentience is a prerequisite for empathy, it makes no sense to feel bad for a rock that is struck by a hammer, but it does make sense to feel bad for a dog that is struck by a hammer, and the difference is the property of sentience in the dog that is absent in the rock. Sentience is what allows for ALL experiences, including the experience of suffering and pleasure, pain and joy, happiness and sadness... not all sentient beings are capable of all of these things, but not all of them are required for a being to have moral worth. When they inevitably ask about when a fetus gains sentience and how he know refer them to this journal article of research that seeks to answer exactly that:

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14767059209161911

The short answer is we aren't sure but 18 weeks is a lower bound due to the development of requisite structure in the brain.

Sentience is the only real property of a being that matters to the issue when considering that beings perspective (because perspective itself requires sentience). If they want to argue about loss to society or negative psychological effects on the mother that is a completely different issue and I could offer some tips as well but in my experience this only comes up rarely... usually they are focused on the fetus.

If you agree and feel like it, I also find that extending a compromise goes a long way. I would accept a compromise of banning abortions after 16 weeks (less than 18 to acknowledge the potential for errors in our understanding) rather than what most of them are seeking: A full blown ban on abortion in general. It's up to you whether you could support that position or not...

---

Here is another good article to refer them to which provides an overview of the philosophical positions on the issue of Full Moral Status:

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounds-moral-status/

This quote from the article is VERY useful:

>whether one belongs to a given species depends on biological criteria, such as whom one can mate with, whom one is born of, or having the relevant DNA. But it is unclear why these biological criteria are relevant for moral status. The point can be sharpened this way. The human species, for example, is a morally relevant category because the species is characterized, in part, by morally relevant properties such as sophisticated intellectual and emotional capacities, and not merely by biological criteria (e.g., mating abilities). But it is unclear why a token member of a species, a token lacking any of these morally relevant capacities, should get the moral status from the type it belongs to (the species). If membership in the type does not require any of the morally relevant features, how can the membership be morally relevant? ",1468855442,30,2016-07-18 11:24:02
485,How do I reply to this?,10,True,"I read it and digesting it, but I've been kind of busy. How do I reply to this?



""I want abortion completely abolished and the women who attempt it (and survive) to be tried for murder and go to prison. I want the doctors and nurses who help them to be shipped off to remote gulags for their crimes against humanity. 

I'm not here to barter on what level of abortion is socially acceptable. I'm a liberal's worst nightmare and completely unapologetic about it.

Now, I don't know what crazy tree you're cherry picking your data from, but on the whole, around a million-point-two babies are aborted every year in the United States.

I don't care if we see a 5% drop year-over-year in legal abortion. The fact remains that we're still shuttling over 3,000 babies into the suction-blender every day - and have been since the passage of Roe V. Wade.

Of course, accurate mortality data before Roe V. Wade is hard to find, but prior to the law, it's estimated that 200,000 abortions were performed each year. That's over a 5X increase since the law was passed.

The levels of reduction you're talking about are a drop in the bucket and unacceptable to someone like me, who is looking to salt the earth and start over. 

I'm looking for a complete reversal of course. Turn the ship around and go back the other way - like Russia is doing right now. Do whatever it takes to change the law of the land.

The only acceptable case - ever - would be for the preservation of the life of the mother - and here the guiding principle is the same as being anti-abortion - that of preserving life. But those cases are so incredibly rare that it's basically a non-issue.""

491,Hypothetical abortion legal question/scenario,2,True,"Based on my discussion here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4s3cse/cmv_the_14th_amendment_implicitly_repealed_the/

I was wondering about this--if, purely hypothetically, the original U.S. Constitution would have prohibited elective abortion nationwide at *any* stage of pregnancy, and you would have been a judge on the U.S. Supreme Court in the late 20th century who would have had to determine the legality of abortion, would you have argued that the U.S. Constitution itself makes abortion illegal? Or would you have argued that the (hypothetical) part of the U.S. Constitution which makes abortion illegal was *implicitly* repealed by later U.S. Constitutional Amendments, such as by the 13th Amendment and/or 14th Amendment?

Indeed, any thoughts on this? After all, I am wondering as to how exactly you would have ruled in such a scenario.

Also, for the record, assume that you would have believed (at the time that you would have needed to make this ruling) that abortion was unlikely to become legalized nationwide in the U.S. (or anywhere in the U.S., for that matter) through a U.S. Constitutional Amendment (due to the lack of necessary support), which in turn would have meant that many additional women would have probably been injured and/or died in ""back-alley"" abortion attempts over the next several decades if the U.S. Supreme Court *wouldn't* have legalized abortion nationwide in the U.S. *right now.*",1468192736,0,2016-07-10 19:18:56
492,"Here is a bit of news, good and bad, from Poland.",12,True,"Hello everyone.           
For goodies skip the introduction.          
A year after the elections a grim reality of having a right-wing government leaning towards orthodox catholic teaching is becoming a source of real fear. We find ourselves defending regulations from the 90s - cool and progressive by the standard of 70s - broadly described as a ~compromise.          
Recently a pro life organization (Fundacja Pro, mildly connected with Ordo Iuris) submitted a project of new regulations with over 500k signatures gathered to the sound of a broken record and displays gross posters all across the country.       
On Thursday, July 7th, we were collecting signatures next to the theatre of Juliusz Słowacki in Krakow with Kazimiera Szczuka (a well spoken jurnalist) under an alternative project (campaign Ratujmy Kobiety). With the deadline set to July 31st and 30k signatures below minimal safe number around 110-120k we pick a spot previously occupied by pro life movement. Harvest ensues.        
           
Goodies in more or less chronological order.          
•	Soon after we started around 1300 several older ladies approach us, while one of them is filling in her ID number she says to the other ‘mom are you going to sign?’, ‘yes, of course’ she responds – from the ID number I read (upside down) the fine year of 1934 when she was born. Another one – a tourist from Warsaw, couldn’t sign at Pride back home. Many more like her stop by.           
•	1400 – first wave of people leaving work is passing by, many of them endured a month of pro-life records played in the underground passage leading to the train station. They rarely ask questions before signing. Maria, our coordinator was wearing a yellow T-shirt and at first some of them thought we were from that other organization. Seeing people rolling hard and fast like a tank to get away just to make a U-turn when they realize something is different … priceless.
•	1500 – News spread like wildfire. Lots of people decided to avoid traffic by using bikes, they just stop, say ‘Hi’, pick a board, sign and ride back home. Each of us is carrying two boards with lists and we can’t keep up. At that time when somebody was rolling at me like a tank I just extend a hand holding board, form and a pencil, several pencils ran out of ink.           
•	1600 – An angry, rabid prolifer learns it is not a good idea to call a megaphone holding journalist a whore. Threatens to call the police, whatever. An older man came with his grandchildren, figured ‘They can learn something with me’ Comments like ‘Mom/wife/brother told me to stop by’ became increasingly common.         
•	1700 – People don’t just sign, they bring full lists from work. Batteries in the megaphone ran out but we continue for another hour.         
•	1800 – We are done for the day, waiting for 300 more signatures from non-government organizations and resting on a bench. City Guards stop by, it turns out using audio equipment in cultural park around the old city requires permission. Batteries in megaphone ran out of juice so they couldn’t confirm complaint  they received, too bad that they wouldn’t sign while on duty.             
             
Bonus – some personal observations:        
It is strange but older folks, born in 1950s or early 60s were very interested in signing the project, just as much as young generation but then there is a gap of people who are now 40-50 years old.         
If you ever intend to do this bring extra pencils, put a small poster on the back of your board that can be recognized.

The post points out that by increasing birth control availability, you dramatically reduce abortions since women abort unwanted pregnancies. So, if pro-lifers were truly concerned about saving lives, they would be working towards ensuring that women have easy and affordable access to birth control to prevent the unwanted pregnancy in the first place. But, pro-lifers don't want that. Their solution is abstinence or marriage....

424,Just a few words on life beginning as conception.,45,True,"Hey /r/pro-choice, it's me, Trusted Adult, one of your more absentee mods and a bona fide abortion-performing ob/gyn.

I just wanted to stop in today because of this article making the rounds on the web about a flash of light being visible at the beginning of conception.  It's bringing up the whole saying about conception being ""the moment life begins.""

First off, conception is really cool.  The acrosomal reaction, the egg's reaction to block other sperm from entering (which is what this article describes), the subsequent completion of meiosis on the part of the egg, the binding of maternal and paternal DNA... it's a cool process.

Implantation is also a really cool process, and is when pregnancy begins.  Organogenesis, or the time in which the fetus is making new organs?  Really cool processes right there.  Birth itself?  Crazy!  I'm still not getting tired of it, and I delivered five babies today.

So lots of things are cool about the whole two-people-make-another-person situation.  And it's true, what the anti-choicers say: a lot of textbooks say ""life begins at conception.""  Or ""conception: the moment life begins.""  Or other dramatic ways of *making students in intro-level classes pay attention*.

That's what those sentences are doing.  These words don't appear in higher-level textbooks, and the reason is that higher-level textbooks need to provide rationale for what they say, and there isn't a reason to call conception the moment that life begins.

From a biological standpoint, it is *convenient* to start thinking of the zygote as a new entity.  It's a simpler way to organize the concepts and think about it.  It's useful for using concepts of evolutionary selfishness.  But none of that has any ethical weight.

Life began a long time ago.  We have a cool process for maintaining it in a weird, generational diploid-haploid-diploid dance.  When personhood begins should be decided by cognitive neuroscience, not molecular biology.

441,Is abortion really about ethics? Or is it actually about equality.,0,True,"Why is such a controversial topic nearly 100% agreed on by democrats and not republicans? 

It's a little weird given how philosophically grey the issue is. Have you ever noticed, the conservative, republican position is typically we make our decisions and therefore you live with the consequences. While the Democratic position is more, you are a product of the system.

Republican position: You have sex you face the consequences.

Democrat: Men don't have to face consequences from when they have sex, women do. Therefore this is inequitable. 


Women are annoyed that men do not have to have an issue with kids. A kid can limit their ability to progress in the world and therefore it is an inequality. Once the child is in the external world, it can have equal ramifications for both men and women but inside her body it only affects women. These defenses are morally egregious but actually underline the real issue. We know, no-one says they had an abortion because they believe they have a right to their body. Even if they did, most people if they had a situation of having to carry another human being they created for 9 months would if they did not have to raise the kid afterwards. The reason women kill the baby is because it will have a tremendous effect on her life.


While I agree, it has a high likelihood of ruining someones life to a degree to have a kid at 18 - this does not justify murder. The left is interested in equality of outcome not opportunity. Because men do not get pregnant they do not suffer the consequences. Abortion is the only way, women can have sex like men and not ever face the consequences. This is a morally abhorrent position but actually underlines the real issue of why leftists supports abortion.

Abortion shouldn't be political. It is philosophically grey because certain higher rights are trumping lower rights of people in our society. When people start debating what right should trump other rights and simultaneously divorce the fetus from humanity it becomes much easier to justify murder. It's the same way people used to justify slavery if a black person is on their property. 

Once the moral argument is re-established. In that we base legality on right and wrong not fairness of outcome. It becomes obvious that laws are not made to protect immoral actions in the pursuit of convenience.",1463334693,24,2016-05-15 13:51:33

1.) The fetus/preborn child also has a right to bodily autonomy (abortion violates their right).

2.) The parents assume the risk and responsibility (with the exception of rape victims).

3.) Parents have a legal and moral obligation to care for their biological/legal children.

4.) Given the exception of the life of the mother, pregnancy and child birth do not pose immediate harm or risk.

443,Duty of care,0,True,"Responsibility of the mother

Most people think that human beings should take responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

And so they say that abortion is wrong where the mother willingly had sex, not because of the moral status of the foetus but because of the responsibilities of the mother.

To put it more formally:

If you voluntarily act in a way that brings about the existence of a person or a foetus, then you have a responsibility to maintain the life of that person or foetus.
So abortion is wrong where the mother had sex of her own free will.

Sure a woman has the right to choose whether or not to become pregnant. She makes that choice before engaging in sex. To make that 'choice' after a pregnancy is underway, merely as a matter of birth control, is an immoral act.
Mona Charen
The argument in steps

a person should accept the consequences of risks that she knowingly and willingly takes
a woman who willingly has sexual intercourse knows that she takes the risk of bringing a foetus/moral person into existence
therefore a woman who becomes pregnant should accept the pregnancy as the consequence of taking the risk involved in sexual intercourse
therefore the woman has a duty of care to the foetus/moral person
therefore she should allow the resulting foetus/moral person to be born
therefore she should not abort the foetus/moral person
This argument works well even if you don't accept that a foetus is a moral person, which is why both terms have been used.

Unwilling sex invalidates this argument

But suppose that a woman has not willingly taken the risk of getting pregnant and so did not have any choice in the conception (perhaps she has been raped, for example).

In this case the woman does not have any responsibility for the foetus and so it seems that abortion is not wrong.

This makes it clear that the vital plank of the argument is not the rights of the foetus, but the duties of the mother.

Contraception and responsibility

It might get trickier where the woman has been using a reliable contraceptive method. She could argue that it would not be wrong to abort the foetus because she did not willingly take the risk of getting pregnant: she took every possible precaution to avoid pregnancy.

The strict logic of the argument is that sometimes very remote possibilities do happen, they do have consequences, and people should take responsibility for them. The result in this case is that the mother is responsible for the foetus and should not abort it.",1463208897,58,2016-05-14 02:54:57

457,Can someone argue for abortion using logic? Not emotions.,0,True,"Logic 1 - Killing a baby 1 second old out of the womb is not moral in today’s society a view held by the left and right.

Logic 2 – It is hard to decipher the difference between a 1 second old baby and the second before the baby exits the womb. If a doctor stabbed a baby to death during a C-section then he committed no immoral act because the baby is not living based on our current definition, that life does not begin until the baby exits the womb. 

If you are morally okay with the stabbing in assumption 2 then you would agree abortion should be legal. I believe this position is morally reprehensible as there is essentially no difference between the two babies. 

Logic 3 – considering assumption 2 sounds morally reprehensible it can be concluded a baby is a person before it exits the womb. The question now becomes how far before?

Logic 4 – Some would now argue that if a baby can survive outside the womb for instance on an incubator then we could determine that it is alive. Since it is surviving without the care of its mother and by a 3rd party machine. Some may not conclude the baby is alive based on its ability to survive without the mother.

Logic 5 – If someone were to stab someone in order to kill them in the year 1300 they would likely die and the person would be accused of murder. Today, if the same event happened the person would likely survive in a hospital. The crime of murder is changing based on our technological ability. As technology becomes more sophisticated there is a greater ability to save the life. However the morality of the stabbing is the same. The person stabbed the other person to kill them. Him succeeding or not does not circumvent his immoral act.  As of today the youngest surviving babies have been 4-5 months. Therefore a person may conclude that any baby that is above 4-5 months should not be allowed to have an abortion based on 3rd party viability. 

Logic  6 –morality should not be defined by our technology. It is immoral to stab someone with intention to kill regardless of the year of the stabbing.  It should also be considered immoral to kill something whether or not they can survive based on the technology of the day. As time goes on, the viability of the fetus will likely get younger and younger of when it can survive without its mother.  Making the definition in assumption 5 problematic. 

Logic  7 – Since it is impossible to figure out the abilities of future technology and that the baby is alive sometime between conception and when it exits to womb and the age may get younger and younger the only logical conclusion is to assume all abortion should not be allowed because we are unable to determine the exact day it is viable. 
 
Improper arguments with improper logic.
1)	Why is sperm or eggs not life-forms? If a man lived on an island and never left it he would never have a kid and the same answer for a women who lived in seclusion. Society would die out if men and women never got together and there would be no life left. Therefore sperm and eggs on its own clearly does not represent life. An analogous example would be to ban all metal because metal is used to build a nuclear reactor. The reactor cannot be built without metal but metal itself doesn’t constitute a reactor. 
2)	Women have the right to choose. Why do women have the right before the baby is born and not afterwards? These two ideas are morally incongruent. If the baby is considered to be alive it cannot be killed. Therefore her choice is not relevant. Only the definition of life is relevant. 
3)	What if a women is raped. Once again the two have nothing to do with each other. Being raped does not allow someone to be murdered. This position is clearly politically unpalatable to everyone. Therefore in the 1/1900 event that the baby is from rape or incest most would say go have your abortion. The left loves to cite this occurrence as being the norm and a disproof to all the above factors which it is not. There is also very little reason to discuss a 1/1900 event as it doesn’t relate to the majority of abortions occurring.
4)	Women have the right to their body. I have the right to my freedom but its limited when it comes to hurting another human being. No right is above the right to kill another human being. 
5)	If the mother’s life is in danger or she is suicidal then an abortion is moral. A baby should never jeopardize the life of the mother.

473,"New NPR article states U.S. ""Teen Birth Rates Plummet for Spanish & Black girls"" since early 90's because ""teens are having less sex."" Does not list Abortion as potential cause at all.",13,True,"Was listening to NPR earlier this week and was confused by this piece. Today I found the link online and wanted to share and get some people's thoughts on it.
http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/04/28/476017134/teen-births-rate-plummet-for-hispanic-and-black-girls

The article sites ""a survey of census data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" stating ""Birth rates are down a whopping 51 percent among Hispanics age 15 to 19 since 2006, and down 44 percent among black teens."" I was obviously glad to hear this statistic but after hearing the studies conclusion on what caused this drop I became skeptical.

""It's really a one-two punch,"" says study co-author Shanna Cox, associate director for science for the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. ""Teens are having less sex, and among the teens who are having sex, they're using more effective methods of birth control.""

This does make sense to me with improved access to information and cultural stigmas about sex education (inside and outside of schools) seemingly fading slightly but the article also goes on to say, ""The report names other efforts that have been effective in reducing teen birth rates:

Examples of activities included presenting community-specific teen birth data to civic leaders; encouraging health care providers to offer evening and weekend hours and low-cost services to increase access; having teen-focused, culturally appropriate materials available dur­ing health care visits; and implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs to reach teens of both sexes both inside and outside of schools (e.g., through Job Corps, alternative schools, churches and community colleges.)""

All potentially helpful in the declining teen birth rate it would seem but nothing about abortions though..
 
The article also states ""The recent decline is part of a longer downward trend in teen birth rates since 1991. But teen pregnancy in the U.S. remains higher than in many other developed countries.""
It does not mention that President Bill Clinton took office shortly after in Jan 1993 using executive orders to overturn several anti-abortion laws or that access to information improved dramatically through the growth of the internet in that time frame. 
It seems to give all the credit to Churches and Schools for carrying the torch in the spread of teen birth data and pregnancy prevention information.

One fact I discovered that does not really support my theory that abortions have contributed to the fall of the teen birth rate is that approx 75% of surgical abortion clinics have closed in the U.S. since 1991. (From 2176 in 1991 to 551 in 2014). Source: http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/still-vanishing-73-abortion-facilities-shut-down-in-2014/

And lastly, in reference to this statement ""teen pregnancy in the U.S. remains higher than in many other developed countries,"" it occurred to me that several other developed countries have legalized abortion with legislation: (i.e. Great Britain, Greece, Sweden, Russia, Japan, China, etc)

Overall, I would acknowledge that it is definitely possible that Teens are having less sex and I do accept the data put forth that shows they are using more contraceptives but not mentioning abortion (when hundreds of thousands are performed each year) or teens having easier access to the internet seemed ridiculous to me. Maybe NPR receives funding from ProLife groups and didn't want to upset them? I could also be wrong or misinterpreting the study & article. Does anyone have any thoughts?

492,"A re-framing of the question of ""when life is created""",8,True,"I've been thinking lately about how there seems to be no defensible answer as to what point life begins. Anyone who views the abortion debate through this lens usually has a pre-conceived notion of when life begins and seeks out science to support their stance, and are unwilling to compromise. But this does not work on a fundamental level because nature does not tell us what 'life' is, and especially not what a 'person' is. Thus, there cannot be a point where non-life becomes life, or a non-person becomes a person.

This leads me to ask: what if we characterize the creation of life to be not a point, but a process? Specifically, one that begins at conception and ends with birth. I think this is more intuitive if we view a person as more than the sum of its parts- a beating heart, a thinking brain, and so on. If one can accept that there are multiple criteria separating a living person from the non-living or non-people, then we cannot isolate the exact moment the latter becomes the former. 

I think if we frame it this way, then it is much easier to see the 'creation of life' as an active choice of the mother *throughout* pregnancy rather than before it. Thus, it follows (a bit more easily) that no matter how great the end result might be, a creator has the right to manage their creation as they see fit, including cessation.

420,[Rant] I'm sick of being called pro-baby-killing.,24,True,"Starting note: I am only talking about pro-lifers who support abortion being illegal. 

I don't think a lot of these pro-lifers understand what they are saying can also be applied to them. For example:

""You support killing babies by supporting legal abortion. You are pro-baby-killing."" 

You know what? I can turn around to them, use their same rhetoric and argue


""You support killing or injuring women and babies by supporting illegal abortion. You are pro-killing-women-and-babies.""

Because 1) Outlawing abortion does not decrease the rate of abortion, it increases the number of unsafe abortions. 
2) If the number of unsafe abortions increase, more women as well as the fetus become injured or die because of complications regarding said unsafe abortions. 

I am simply choosing the ""lesser of two evils"", as you will. Nobody is pro-abortion (edit: could be wrong about this). Technically could this be considered more pro-life than what these pro-lifers want? 
Wouldn't pro-lifers be more concerned about 'saving' the most lives?

423,Pro-choice car accident analogy?,9,True,"Is this argument any good? 

If someone says they are pro-life, ask them how they justify driving a car. We know that thousands of children die every year in car accidents and that if you get in a car and drive, you run the risk of accidentally killing a child. Cars are not necessary - our society clearly functioned without them and they are a matter of pleasure and convenience. Therefore, every time you drive a car, you risk a child's life for your own pleasure, just as pro-lifers allege that a woman risks creating and destroying a child's life for her own sexual pleasure.

The argument that not as many children die in car accidents as in abortions is not valid - the death of an innocent can't be acceptable because it occurs on a lesser scale. It would also be flawed to say that we agreed to collectively take this risk in order to function more smoothly as a society. We can't say that our modern economy is based on cars - pro-lifers don't bend their ideology to accommodate pragmatism.

The distinction that children consent to ride in cars is not valid - infants certainly don't and older children can't meaningfully understand and take the risk of riding in cars any more than a child could consent to having sex with an adult. 

It seems to me the best argument against this is that a woman chooses twice, once to take the risk of having sex and then again to take the intentional step of ending the pregnancy. Car drivers don't take that second intentional step of ending another person's life. But imagine that's how it worked. What if Driver A gets in a no-fault car accident and a child passenger in the other car is badly injured. The doctor tells Driver A that the only way the child's life can be saved is if Driver A agrees to connect her organs to the child for nine months (like in Judith Thomson's violinist example). Would we require Driver A to consent to this? Oh, and by the way, in this world, this is only a problem female drivers have to worry about, male drivers don't have to make this type of decision.

431,A pro-life argument I haven't heard before,4,True,"You think you've heard it all until someone comes up with this. It was seen in an FB thread. 
Here goes:

--
""Look up fungibility. Every penny of government funds given to abortion clinics goes to abortion or support abortion. If it didn't, PP wouldn't fight having minimum ambulatory standards (the same standard as doc-in-a-boxes) because they would already be meeting those standards for all the life-saving services they offer.

Also, I have never heard of 1) a woman being required by law to keep a still born, dead baby to term (even in the incredibly rare case when the body didn't reject it on it's own.) and 2) never met or even heard of a person with a moral problem with the removal of such a deceased baby. (Excepting, perhaps JW's who don't believe in surgery, but we can discard that thinking outright.) A D&C is not an abortion if the baby is dead.

As to your 'you'll never experience' card board cutout, it is super unlikely that I will be raped, I will never play with the Beatles, I will never walk on the moon or beat a man to death with his shoes, but I have opinions and beliefs about all of those things, too. 

Ethics and moral philosophy ought not be governed by nor exclusive to your feelings and experiences.

Evidence demonstrates it as early as 14 weeks. Some can survive outside the womb at 22 weeks. They learn sounds and voices; and can suffer trauma.

Can they live it true autonomy and independence? No and neither can infants, the aged, and the confirmed. And neither can you. That is not a basis for personhood.


Humanity is by design a bizarre inter-weaving of dependence and autonomy. The false doctrine of 'bodily autonomy' denies the realities of biology.

The fact is you think because someone is dependent on another then they means they have no rights to life. That is the bottom line. 
You don't want to have a child then keep your legs closed. It is that simple. I mean the ignorance on sex is astounding. Sex is not just about pleasure and there are consequences to doing it. Your idea of fixing one of those consequences is to kill the child for something the mother chose to do. You see she chose to have sex with the knowledge that getting pregnant is a consequence that comes with that action.

I understand the flawed idea of bodily autonomy. I reject it as a fallacy. The view denies the reality of biologic procreation.

A human cannot choose to create a life. Life happens as a function of natural processes, not unlike weather or age. If life is not the result of true volition, it is something outside of the bevy of human liberty.

Your view assumes a human authority over something human will did not create, cannot control, and cannot improve. It denies the science.""

To be clear, I am not speaking for Planned Parenthood, just stating my occupation and my personal views. 

The other nurses and I are currently raising money to help girls and women who cannot afford their abortions through an organization called NNAF (National Network of Abortion Funds)

As you may all know, it is incredibly important for us to keep abortion accessible and safe in order to prevent the days before Roe v. Wade from every happening again. Unfortunately, while we try to help where we can, we cannot cover the cost of abortions for everyone who needs one. 

I found out personally how frightening and daunting the cost of abortion can be when I had my abortion at 18. I was unable to tell anyone at the time and had absolutely no financial means to cover the cost of my an abortion. It was only through the fact that people who didn't know me actually cared about what I was going through that I was able to have the abortion and finish college. 

I'm not quite sure what the rules are on fundraising but if it is OK, I'd like to provide a link to our page for donations [here!](http://bowlathon.nnaf.org/KimHanna79) 

Finally, I wish I could reach out and tell everyone here who has had an abortion that you are **not alone**. 1 in 3 women will have an abortion in their lifetime and even if you know you're making the *right* choice; it doesn't mean it is an *easy* choice.

She does on telling me that I am a p.o.s. and that if she lost her planned pregnancy that i would have been happy for her. I told her that it isn't how it works. I told her that if she was 14 years old and made a mistake and wanted to get an abortion, I'd support her. Not when she is 28, married, and was trying to have a baby when she is ready. I asked her what about rape cases and she said that it was act of God and that no matter the age of the women, the baby should be born and placed up for adoption. I went on telling her that I know personally for myself i couldn't go through with it but if someone else decided it was best for them, that is their body not mine. It's going to happen anyway, my as well offer a safe place for them to do so. Then she told me to never ever see her again and to stay as far away from her and her baby because she might think i want to kill her baby. I am just sitting here like what the fuck?

After all, *if* one is politically anti-abortion, then wouldn't it *actually make sense* to advocate punishing women who get illegal abortions? Indeed, if one hires a hit man to do a crime, then shouldn't *both* this person *and* the hit man be punished for this crime?

455,My Abortion Story...As a Male,0,True,"Okay, so I get that men don't have to go through birth. I really do. But this is why men get to have an opinion.

About 1% of abortions in the USA are sex selective, and 100 million females are missing because of sex selection.

Males also suffer from abortion problems. Fathers lose their children without their knowledge or consent some of the time. 

Another thing is, some kids survive abortions.
http://joseromia.tripod.com/survivors.html
http://listverse.com/2013/08/20/10-abortion-survivors/

I am one of those kids. I am currently 14 years old and a gay teenager. But that's not the point.

My mother conceived me at 16 with a 25 year old man. I was unwanted and she attempted an abortion, what type, I don't know. But I survived, I'm a fighter. My relationship with my mother is complicated, but we get along and love each other. Not the point. I suffer from minor problems from the failed procedure but nothing too major. I'm a bit short, and a bit thin, but alive, breathing, and healthy.

So abortion affected me deeply. I have a brother and a sister and a loving family. Today, I'm an outspoken pro lifer and occasionally overzealous. But I'm alive.

So ask me how I feel about abortion.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing/seeing your response. I believe I have something to gain from this and perhaps you do too. I want a pro-choice viewpoint and you may want a pro life viewpoint. ",1459209437,63,2016-03-28 19:57:17

461,How to Eliminate the major need for abortion,0,True,"In my opinion, the real issue here is how can we prevent these babies from being conceived in the first place. We need to come up with a birth control that can stop this process. If a condom breaks, sometimes a baby is created. If you get a vasectomy or your tubes tied (depending on your biological gender) and have sex, sometimes a baby is created. If two people have unprotected sex, a baby is created. The question is, how can we have a 100% birth control where these unwanted babies are not created in the first place and not cause permanent infertility? A solid answer to this question would drive down abortion rates tremendously.

Some people might say in opposition to this statement,""Don't have sex in the first place and this wouldn't happen."" That concept works if you refrain from sex before marriage, but obviously the majority of the population does not follow the Christian way of thinking, thus creating this issue. We need to stop the production of abortions without limiting the initial choice because the initial choice (choosing to have sex) cannot be controlled.﻿ Abortions would still be a thing, but not prevalent across the country as it is now. 

The issue for Pro-life supporters is not refuting a women's right to choose, they only want to save these babies that are being murdered. By not creating a life in the first place, (we can all live happily ever after) it will solve both the Pro-life/Pro-choice issues and hopefully end the divide that this topic causes in society.",1458606537,64,2016-03-21 20:28:57

467,"Excerpt from the pro-life extremist ""Army of God"" manual",4,True,"Recently came across this and it's ... scary, especially when you start noticing correlations with events in the news (like the use of butyric acid in vandalism of abortion clinics).  I'm not going to link to the document, because it reads like a religious version of the anarchists cookbook, covers a number of illegal acts of violence and vandalism, and I'm not comfortable aiding in its propagation, but I did want to share part of it that really needs to be shown because *this sort of thing is out there*.  It's not some figment of the 'Main Stream Media' or the Planned Parenthood PR machine or some such.  There are pro-life people who think this way.

(Please note - I don't believe, by any means, that this is the mindset of all, or even most of pro-life advocates, but it cannot be denied that this kind of violent extremism is part of that movement.)

These portions comes from an 'interview' between an Army Of God member (A.O.G.) and the interviewer, 'Mad Gluer' (M.G.)

----------------

**A.O.G.**: Drive the abortion industry underground with or without the sanction of government law. 

**M.G.**: By what method? 

**A.O.G.**: Explosives, predominantly. 

**M.G.**: Would you care to elaborate? 

**A.O.G.**: Certainly. First by disarming the murder weapons. That is, by destroying the structures where the actual crimes are being committed. Second, by disarming the persons perpetrating the crimes by removing their hands, or at least their thumbs below the second digit. 

--------

**A.O.G.**: Activity that attempts to protect women and children is positive. Period. Inactivity is negative. To tell you the truth, I'm not really sure what the ""Pro-Life Movement"" is! If your question was in regard to public opinion as influenced by the media, I would have to say that, contrary to popular opinion, it is easy at this time for the media as a whole to hold the position that they do: they can comfortably be for death. Not so when the honorable citizens of any given community begin to rise up in righteous indignation and destroy these miniature Dachaus. All of a sudden, apathy is gone. The average reporter says to himself, ""Wow! Maybe there are a few people that really believe all this jargon about abortion being murder."" 

**M.G.**: What do you recommend that concerned citizens do at this time? 

**A.O.G.**: Every Pro-Life person should commit to destroying at least one death camp *[abortion clinic]*, or disarming at least one baby killer *[thumb removal]*.  The former is a relatively easy task - the latter could be  quite difficult to accomplish.  The preferred method for the novice would be gasoline and matches. Straight and easy.  No tracks.  You've kind of got to pour and light and leave real fast because of the fammability *[sic]* factor.  Kerosence *[sic]* is great, but a little more traceable, so you wold not want to buy it and use it in the same day. 

**M.G.**: What about explosives?

468,Bodily Autonomy in Pro-choice and Vaccines,6,True,"So there are two topics that I am very passionate about.  A woman's right to choose based on many reasons, but it always comes back to her right to bodily autonomy, and I am for mandatory vaccinations as long as there is no medical reason not to do so (compromised immune system, etc).

However, I realized that if I apply the principle of autonomy to my vaccine argument, it actually weakens it. It would then follow that people could simply choose not to vaccinate (and endanger themselves and those around them by doing so) by practicing their right to bodily autonomy.   
Any thoughts? Or do I need to revise my belief system?

and I read: ""From a legal standpoint, what you do with your reproductive system as an adult is entirely up to you.""

Why is this the idea supporting men's reproductive rights, but not women's? Why do people fight so hard against a woman's choice to do as she pleases wth her body, but the same is not true for a man's choices?  
An 18 year old boy can get a vasectomy if he chooses to. Maybe the doctor tries to talk him out of it, but no one will threaten him, or make him feel unsafe or like he has committed the worst atrocity. 
An 18 year old girl tries to get an abortion and she is subject to judgement from all angles, may be attacked verbally or physically by people who know about it, and will probably at some point be made to feel like she's the worst human to exist because of her choice.

After all, for all of the talk about unplanned parenthood, contraception failure, not wanting to punish people for mistakes, et cetera, I have *never* heard of *any* pro-choice politician, judge, et cetera advocate in favor of giving male-bodied people a unilateral opt-out from paying child support. (Also, while my argument here would certainly likewise apply to female-bodied people, can't female-bodied people already de facto unilaterally opt-out of paying child support using safe haven laws?)

Indeed, this along with the speceisist position of some pro-choicers unfortunately makes my own support for the pro-choice cause rather lukewarm. :( After all, if I embraced the same views on responsibility and speceisism that some/many pro-choicers have, then I myself might very well become politically anti-abortion (indeed, unlike many/most pro-choicers, I myself certainly *don't* view bodily autonomy as being a ""holy cow"").

['Trapped'](https://www.trappeddocumentary.com/), a documentary directed by Dawn Porter, focuses on the nearly 300 laws regulating abortion providers that have been passed by state legislatures since 2010, according to its site. Much of the documentary focuses on Texas, where a controversial, omnibus law passed in 2013 (HB2) led to the closures of a vast majority of abortion providers.

The 80-minute film features lengthy interviews with Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, a group of reproductive health clinics operating eight locations in five states including Texas, and Marva Sadler, director of clinical services for the organization, who is based in the Lone Star State.

Miller is also the lead plaintiff in in the Supreme Court Case [Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/).

And the particularly salient excerpt is below:

'One issue for which he has been widely lauded is his position during the same-sex marriage campaign. The 37-year-old was hailed as a hero and leading light for a generation of young people on the cusp of a social revolution. Many involved in the 'Home to Vote' campaign are gearing up to get behind the drive for a referendum on the Eighth Amendment - which equates the right to life of the unborn with the mother's right to life. Many pro-choice campaigners hope it will pave the way for full, safe access to abortion in Ireland.

On record, he has already stated he is ""pro-life"" and does not want abortion-on-demand introduced here.

""It would be weird to me if the right to property was there [in the Constitution] and not the right to be alive,"" he laughs.

Where does he believe life begins? He laughs again: ""I'm not equipped to answer that. I honestly don't know the answer to that question.""

Does he believe it is important we start an open and mature discussion on abortion in Ireland?

""Yeah, I do and that's what we intend to do.""

Two minutes later - he shuts down a list of questions on his own views. Ranging from foetal abnormalities to cases of rape, incest and suicide - he pointedly refuses, saying he has agreed beforehand the interview wouldn't include the issue of abortion. [Although he was happy before the interview when informed that would be covered].

I explain that as the Minster for Health - a post in which he wishes to continue - it is important people know his views. It is on one of the biggest health and social issues of the next generation. And so, I kick off the list of 'yes or no' questions again.

Do you believe in abortion when the foetus isn't viable?

""Em… I'm sort of conscious that we are going into a general election now and I am running in the general election as a Fine Gael candidate and I am asking people to vote for me as a FG candidate and I am not asking them to vote for me based on my personal or individual views.""

He repeats the line eight times over the course of our conversation. I ask if his personal views affect his politics.

""Of course they do… but the mandate I am seeking in the context of a general election is for Fine Gael's position.""

Does he believe abortion in Ireland is a class issue?

""No,"" he laughs. ""I don't know what that question means.""

I explain that a woman who is wealthy and can afford to travel to the UK has greater access to a safe abortion and medical care than a woman who has no access to similar funds.

""No, I don't think it's a class issue.""

And so I ask, as Minister for Health, what he would say to the 12 Irish women who have to travel to the UK every day for an abortion?

""It would depend on each individual.""

Is there an indignity in these women having to travel abroad?

He sighs: ""I really had understood this interview was going to be about health and politics.""

458,My (positive) surgical abortion story,39,True,"First of all, thank you to everyone on this sub who offered me comfort and advice in November before my procedure. Your personal experiences helped me so much that I wanted to share my own story in case there's another nervous woman out there who just wants to know that everything is going to be okay. 

My fiancé and I found out in October that I was pregnant and decided that we needed to terminate for financial reasons. I was heartbroken and excessively nervous due to generalized anxiety disorder and worry over my other health issues. I have suffered from bartholin's and ovarian cysts for over a year, and I was concerned that a surgical abortion would irritate the cyst to the point of it needing to be drained again (a very painful procedure that I couldn't afford to pay for a third time, especially on top of the abortion). At the time, I was also in the process of opening my pop-up restaurant and working almost 70 hours a week. I knew that I would have little to no time to recover from my abortion and was scared there would be complications. 

I made an appointment at a Family Planning Associates women's health clinic in downtown LA. My fiancé drove me, and when we arrived there were already protestors outside the clinic at 8 in the morning. While we were waiting for the clinic to open (I had the first appt of the day), another man came up to my fiancé and handed him a pamphlet, telling him to be a man and not let me do this. I was appalled and immediately lashed out, asking if he thought my fiancé owned my body. Another woman waiting for an abortion with her sister asked the man if he was going to help us pay for and take care of our babies. Thankfully, a woman came to unlock the clinic doors and let us in, but the protestors shouted after us, ""Don't do that! Don't do that to your baby! It's a baby in there!"" I could hear them screaming and shaking their rosaries all the way into the waiting room. 

First, I was called back for an ultrasound. I had guessed that I was six weeks pregnant at the most and was concerned that it would be too early for a surgical abortion, but the technician informed me that I was almost 9 weeks. She didn't offer to show me the ultrasound, but she printed a copy of it and attached it to my file. I saw it over her shoulder as I followed her back to the waiting room, and suddenly everything seemed very real and vivid. When I made eye contact with my fiancé again across the room, I couldn't stop myself from smiling a huge, shit-eating grin at the thought of the ultrasound. He seemed confused at my happiness, as did the other stressed-looking women in the waiting room, and as quickly as it came my little bubble of elation burst. 

I was called back a second time for a blood test, and afterwards I was given a gown and hairnet to change into and a bag for my belongings. I was then shown into a different room, where four other pregnant women in gowns waited. At first we were all silent, but after a while we started sharing our stories. Three of the five of us already had children and were single parents who couldn't afford another child. Another woman had such severe hyperemesis gravidarum (extreme morning sickness) that she hadn't been able to drink water or eat for almost three days and was completely unable to work or care for her other infant. Listening to their stories, I felt privileged to know that my fiancé was waiting for me somewhere in the building and that I hadn't had to do this on my own. 

One by one, we were called back into the operating room. I opted to be put under general anesthesia because of my anxiety and the pain in my cyst, and the anesthesiologist confirmed this with me as we walked down the hall. I also chose to have a Skyla IUD inserted during the procedure (I had wanted to get one for years, but fear of insertion pain had stopped me). 

I was helped onto the operating table by a woman who was laying down clean, white pads on the floor under the stirrups where my legs would go. I was starting to feel anxious and panicky, but before I could really get into my own head the doctor came in, introduced himself, told me everything would be okay in less than twenty minutes, and injected me with the anesthesia. 

I remember feeling euphoric and tingly for a few moments as I looked up at the bright lights shining between my legs, and then suddenly I was waking up in a curtained stall. I could hear women on either side of me. One asked a nurse if she could get something for the pain, and that was when I became aware of the cramps in my abdomen. They weren't any more unbearable than my period is on the worst of cramp days, but they came suddenly and forcefully. A nurse came and massaged my belly above my uterus for a bit and then pulled down my blankets to check how much I was bleeding (while I was out, the nurses had put a pair of underwear on me with a pad). I was shocked by how little blood there was. It was bright red, but much less than what I would even expect on a light period day. She left me to slowly wake up before helping me walk to another room where I was allowed to change. I was given crackers for nausea and ibuprofen for the cramps. While I munched in a daze, I was given ""exit counseling"" (don't have sex for two weeks, don't soak in water, take your antibiotic, etc etc). Someone handed me a bag with more crackers and gave me directions back to the waiting room, and it was all over. 

When I got home, I undressed and checked my cyst. It was irritated and slightly more swollen than usual after the surgery, but bearable. I made an appointment that day to go see my actual gynecologist to make sure the cysts didn't become infected again and to check that my IUD was properly in place. 

The rest of the day I felt tired and sort of just generally out of it, but three hours after I got home I was feeling well enough to go buy ingredients for the restaurant and eat a huge lunch. My pregnancy symptoms (nausea, food aversion, extreme fatigue) had already completely disappeared and I was feeling much better physically than I had when I woke up that morning. My breasts, which had gained a cup size in the last two weeks of my pregnancy, remained swollen and sore for a week after the abortion, but I had no leakage or other problems. 

The only real issue that I experienced were contraction-like cramps that would hit me randomly for a month or two after the abortion, however this was most likely a side effect of the IUD and nothing to do with the abortion itself. I was able to have pain-free sex with my fiancé as soon as the two weeks were up, and the swelling in my cyst calmed around the same time. I had little to no bleeding at all throughout my entire recovery. 

It's been almost three months since my abortion and my body is basically back to normal, aside from an irregular cycle thanks to the IUD. I'm not very good at healthily handling my emotions (hence, the anxiety disorder), and I'm just now beginning to deal with some of my feelings about the abortion. There are days when I really feel awful and wish that I didn't do it, because my fiancé and I do want children, but then I remember why we chose to terminate and that if I was pregnant right now we would already be bankrupt from the doctor appointments, and I would probably have had to close my restaurant. 

Anyways, I'm sorry if this was really long and rambling. This is the first time I've tried to write about my abortion experience and I feel like I have a lot to say. I also wanted to give as many details as possible so that anyone who is looking for comfort before their own procedure will know what to expect. I would be happy to answer any other questions about my experience, and thank you again for all your support.",1454792146,4,2016-02-06 15:55:46
461,"Pro-Choice Princess, where choice can be cheeky (Ireland)",23,True,"Hello! I live in Ireland and things are pretty dire here right now (more than happy to provide info if anyone is interested!), but we're hoping that things will change soon. The ban on abortion is actually in our constitution, so many of us are pushing for a referendum to repeal the 8th amendment -- and there's support for that position from the UN and much of the international community.

I'm part of several activist groups, and we are starting to plan some performance-based actions where we'll have ""princesses"" discussing abortion. The hope is to use these hyper-feminine stereotypes to question assumptions about ""what kind of woman"" gets abortions. A friend has set up a Facebook account at https://www.facebook.com/prochoiceprincess/ and we're going to start up on Twitter soon. 

I'd love to spread the word around, get anyone who'd like to submit slogans or art to join us, and maybe get some input and ideas from the reddit world :). We're just starting this and we want to amass content, generate discussion, and attack this issue with tongues-in-cheek to stand firmly beside the more serious protests that we also take part in!

474,Healthier for the Woman?,0,True,"A civil question for the Pro Choice community: The biggest risk to a woman who has an abortion procedure are the possible medical complications (some fetal tissue is left behind, perforated uterus, etc.) The ACOG has found a safer way...deliver the fetus and terminate once outside the woman. That way no pieces are accidentally left behind and the danger of using suction is eliminated. Ignoring the Partial Birth Abortion Ban that Bush signed into law, would most of the Pro Choice community support this safer method of termination?

476,An Email Conversation with A Pro-Life Activist...,7,True,"A while back there was a Pro-Life protest at my High School. The people protesting gave us pamphlets I decided to contact the people behind this. We got into a lengthy discussion. Here are some highlights relating to this subreddit (I wanna post the religion stuff somewhere else like /r/atheism)

To my question: Do you think abstinence only education is the right thing?

Guvmint skules should be abolished entirely, for one thing. And children should be taught what sex truly is - it is created by God for a loving, committed, heterosexual, covenant relationship between a husband and a wife. 

To my question: What do you think of contraceptives?

Chemical and hormonal contraceptives include abortifacient properties and should be not only banned but also rejected voluntarily by every single sexually active person.
Barrier methods such as condoms - I don't believe there is a major moral objection to a married couple using condoms sometimes.

491,"I'm Pro-life, and I'll just leave this here. (copy-paste from a different person) Hear me out pls, you might not have heard this side of the story. I want this to be a positive and educational discussion.",0,True,"People are asking me what would happen if abortion is outlawed. Let me go over that because people don't have an accurate impression of what things were like pre Roe. (And let me add that I have not been very active in pro-life matters for some years, and the information I give below is 10 yrs old or so. However, most of what I'm talking about is 40+ years history. The major change in recent years is the availability of the abortion pill, which means fewer women having surgical abortions.)
Go back to 1972, the last year before Roe. In that year 39 women died from illegal abortion, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Every one of them was a tragedy; but put it in proportion: the same year 95 people died from being struck by lightning. And every one of those women deliberately chose to have an illegal abortion. You prevent deaths from illegal abortion by not having an illegal abortion.
The stories about back-alley butchers have been greatly exaggerated and the numbers of deaths wildly inflated. But that distortion has a plus side: people are very afraid of having illegal abortions. Before a vote restricting abortion in Louisiana some years back, 95% of women said that if abortion was illegal, they would not seek one. If there were to be a public education campaign teaching the danger of illegal abortion, it would be something both pro-life and pro-choice could cooperate on. Yet, as I said, even back then illegal abortion was not the massive killer people think it was. Bernard Nathanson was one of the first full-time abortion providers in NYC and a founder of NARAL. He admits in his autobiography, ""Aborting America,"" that he invented the number 10,000 out of thin air, claiming that it was the number of annual deaths from illegal abortion. He believed the legal abortion was a good cause so it would be OK if he lied. Reporters printed the number he told them; and then other reporters treated those published articles as factual sources. The number kept perpetuating itself; but it was never anywhere near the truth.
A coincidence of history is that just about the time abortion was legalized, there was a major change in how it is performed. Before, the procedure was ""D & C,"" dilation (of the cervix) and curretage--scraping the inside of the uterus with a knife.
These procedures were usually done by licensed doctors, not hacks. Doctors were had been trained to use the D & C procedure in cases where there is a retained miscarriage. So they were trained and did these procedures from time to time as cases came up. In the case of a woman wanting an abortion, if the doctor was willing, she would come to the office in the off hours, typically entering unseen through a door from the alley. That's why it's called ""back alley"" abortion. These were not abortions done by butchers who didn't know what they were doing--one evidence being that the death rate was low. They were done by professionals who did them as well as can be done, but there is inherent risk in the D & C procedure no matter how skilled the doctor.
Right about the time of Roe v Wade, though, a new procedure was introduced. Instead of using a knife, the doctor could use a vacuum aspiration machine. He could sweep the inner walls of the uterus with a hose with a rigid tip, going back and forth, locating the fetus and vacuuming it up into the tube. The tip is smaller than the fetus, so the suction can grab hold of it. The fetus is pulled to pieces, sucked through the narrow hose, and the body parts and placenta are collected in a bag or on a screen. It's important that all the body parts be present, because anything left behind could cause infection. Back when I stayed on top of statistics, about 90% of all abortions done in America were of this type. I expect the percentage is lower now, because the abortion pill is now available as an alternative.
The vacuum aspiration machine is much safer for the woman than the old D & C. A pro-life doctor I know who had been trained in the old technique (for retained miscarriage) and then switched to the vacuum machine when it was available said it was like night and day.
So comparing death rates before and after legalization is kind of apples and oranges. The illegal abortions were more likely to be D & Cs, and legal abortions more likely to be vacuum aspiration. If abortion were made illegal again, these machines would not disappear. Doctors would still use them in the case of a retained miscarriage. If there were any demand for illegal abortion, we can expect history will to some extent repeat: trained doctors, in their offices, clandestinely using the suction machines they already have on hand. There would be no reason to go back to knife-scraping D & C.
But as I said there has been a lot of publicity about how dangerous and deadly illegal abortion can be. In 1972, it wasn't much talked about, but people know about the danger now. Illegal abortion is regarded as deadly, so it's not an option people will be as inclined to take.
And on the other side, there is less pressure to have an abortion. Single parenthood is much more accepted than it was in 1972. Being pregnant out of wedlock is not longer the disaster it once was. The world has changed.
And also contraception is much more available than it was in 1972. There are fewer unwanted pregnancies. The numbers of legal abortions have gone down, due to a combination of factors like these.
The best solution in an unplanned, unwed pregnancy would be for the mother and father to marry, and have a good marriage, and raise their children with love. That's not always a possibility. But it does happen some times, and I believe we should encourage young couples to consider the option more than we do. Our culture is too quick to condemn young men as callous and irresponsible. Young men can be courageous when the circumstances require it. We shouldn't rush to set up the woman in a single-parent home without at least considering whether that child could be raised in a happy home with two responsible, loving birth parents.
Alternatively, there's adoption. In the '90s I helped found and run an organization that brought together pro-life and pro-choice advocates in dialogue. One of the first things we discovered was that both sides think adoption is a good option and wish it was considered more often.
Also, we found that both sides believe that preventing pregnancy is better than abortion. Some people want to prevent pregnancy with contraception, while others want to prevent it with abstinence (which has a higher rate of successfully preventing pregnancy). But we agreed on a common goal. No one was in favor of abortion. Everyone preferred to prevent.
Most pro-life effort and money goes into direct aid to pregnant women and new moms. Way back in 1965, 8 yrs before Roe, the first Birthright was founded, and now there are several thousand of these storefront operations, where women can come in for a pregnancy test and be provided a wide range of help. Pregnancy centers try to solve the problems that make women think abortion is their only option. They don't get any federal funding for this. They run on donations, bake sales, fundraisers, etc. Surprisingly, pro-choice people don't run organizations like these or offer support to women continuing their pregnancies. They don't come help at the pro-life pregnancy centers either, pitching in to share the work and overlooking divisions to make sure that women truly have a choice. You would think that would be a big part of the pro-choice movement, but it's not. The whole field of caring for pregnant women is pretty much done by pro-lifers.
They offer clothing, baby food, diapers, job training, a whole lot of things. Some expand into being medical clinics offering prenatal care. In 1993 I began work on a book, ""Real Choices,"" trying to find out what women's needs really are. I talked to women who had had abortions and asked what they would have needed, in order to have had the child. And I talked with pregnancy care centers to learn what are the most common needs that women talk about when they come in. I was hoping to talk with abortion clinic counselors and get their perspective as well, but could not find anyone willing to talk with me.
The big surprise was that women didn't say they needed practical or financial help. They told me they knew where to get resources. The main reason they had the abortion was because someone they loved told them to. Most of the time it was the father of the child; but some of the time it was her parents. Over and over women told me ""If only one person had stood by me, I would have had that baby."" Pregnancy care centers regularly run short of money, because they give their goods and services without payment, and are dependent on donations. But even if they have nothing left they are still able to offer that shoulder to cry on, that moral support.
One woman told me ""Everyone said they would be there for me if I had the abortion. Nobody said they'd be there for me if I had the baby.""
Two women told me ""I was lying on the abortion table praying my boyfriend would come in and say 'Stop, I changed my mind.'""",1453526374,16,2016-01-23 00:19:34
