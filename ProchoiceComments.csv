2,"Just curious about something. Why do you refer to it as an inconvenience? Do you really think becoming unwontedly pregnant is just an inconvenience? As you can probably tell by my name, I am a member of the childfree community. MANY childfree women, including some that I personally know have become accidentally pregnant through various ways, mainly contraceptive failures ( they DO happen.) Anyway, I am curious as to whether you would honestly insist to them that they HAVE to refer to themselves as mothers because they had one of their eggs fertilized. MOST of the women had abortions, with a few having miscarriages. And since you must be aware of the fact that there is currently NO fool-proof contraceptive that exists, how do you propose that women that are childfree such as myself can remain childfree without abortion being available as a safety net form of birth control?",1,1521941515,2018-03-24 21:31:55
3,"More ways feminism is ruining the world

1. Feminist want to wait longer to be married because they want to stay independent of men. 
2. Many more children are in child care because most feminists don't raise and nurture children  -proven fact
3. They make men less of men. Feminists force men to be less masculine and makes men less likely to speak up because if they do, feminists can easily label them a hater, and even charge them with harassment. 

True college story
College women get drunk, have sex, get pregnant, wake up the next morning and regret it all, then they accuse the man of rape. In court, they play the 'woman card' and a man goes to jail for rape, loses the respect of his friends, peers, professors, sports coaches, and worst of all can't get a job easily as a charged rapist.

23,"Ok I have a lot. 


This is a complete generalization of my view of feminism. I am 100% honest. I may not be 100% right, but I'm not posting this as a troll. 


1. I am a feminist. I am not a 21^st century egotistical 'feminist'. 
21^st century feminists are not really feminists. People have twisted that cause and made it into something very dark. 
2. Jesus Christ was a feminist. My Catholic God is feminist. This is what people don't know. There are many places in the Bible which wrote about Jesus conversing with women. The first witnesses of Jesus' ressurection were women from Jerusalem. Did yo know in the time of Jesus, what women said meant less than nothing? So why would the first witnesses of Jesus' Ressurection be women? You don't have to believe that Jesus ressurected, but know that women are important in the Bible. What does this have to do with feminism? Easy to tell because it shows women are important to God. 
3.  Why do feminist try to prove that women are the superior gender? This is the main thing that bothers me. 
-Men are the superior gender by default. That takes nothing away from women. Women have every right that a man has. Any studies that show women get paid less is completely wrong. That can be swayed by any number of variables THAT INCLUDE a mans ability to work more effective. This isn't always the case, but genetically a man can push himself harder than a woman can. Men are stronger, thus can work harder. Women, however, are more stubborn (in an amazing way) and that allows women o be more persistent in their duties allowing them to get the job done, and done right.
4. I respect feminists and I would never disgrace them (others can do that for me). If my friend was a feminist it would not change my friendship. I respect them because they are fighting for a cause and you gotta love that. 
5. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST FEMINISTS! I never attack a feminist as a human. I will surely attack their beliefs and what they stabd for, but I will never disgrace a 21^st century feminist. 

I can give a lot more reasons. I did not go into feminists disgracing themselves, feminists making the world a worse place, and a number of other things. I can give a lot more if you admit I'm at least partially right. ",1,1521849098,2018-03-23 19:51:38

32,"People who seek abortions are the best qualified to judge their lifestyle and whether they can even afford another child. In general, being poor is expensive.


First, a lot of women who seek abortions are poor. No way around that. Being poor means you may pay a lot for health insurance or just risk no insurance in general.


A lot of lower income jobs may not have set hours. They may also have alternative hours. Trying to find childcare that covers the 3-11 shift is hard and expensive. Or imagine working 8-5 one day, 3-11 rhe next two days, and you never know week to week what hours or days you have. Imagine if you worked nights. I have seen people say “let your mom help out!” Ok, maybe the grandma in this case is a horrible, cruel person, or dead or still working herself or too sick or a drug user. Some people do not have a parent to lean on. 


Everything costs more. Car breaks down frequently and it is easier for them to repair it because they can’t afford a down payment or their credit sucks.


Imagine having to go to the laundry mat to wash clothes. If you have multiple kids with no one to watch them with no car or limited car use, how hard would it be to add a baby in the mix? Babies poop a lot. 


Cost of formula. Many lower income moms can’t get adequate time to pump despite it being the law. WICC helps some but babies eat a lot.


Grocery stores. Most lower income neughborhoods do not have grocery stores. Look up food deserts. Many areas have loads of fast food. 


I personally think it is crazy we do not have paid maternity leave. Other countries do. We claim to want the best for children yet if you’re a single mom, you may not have luxury or savings to take the 8 weeks of unpaid maternity leave.

Also, it's only fair to compare countries of similar levels of development. Mexico and the US are way too different economically for any meaningful comparison. 

Just because owning guns is a constitutional right in the US doesn't mean that it should remain that way. Guns only serve to hurt people, it makes sense to make them impossible to get for anyone besides the police and the military. Just because some people enjoy owning guns as a hobby doesn't mean they should be allowed to have real guns when that makes society less safe.

Very well (even though you *literally* just relied on conjecture yourself to make a very weak point about gun crime in SK) here are some facts. [Many of the countries with the strictest gun control have the highest rates of violent crime. Australia and England, which have virtually banned gun ownership, have the highest rates of robbery, sexual assault, and assault with force of the top 17 industrialized countries. ](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/guns-in-other-countries/) Countries with the stricktest gun control also tend to have the highest rates of gun related crime (same page). I suggest you read through this page before replying about ""real world facts"" and conjecture.

Also, American gun culture is not the same as Australia and unlike Australia gun ownership is a literal constitutional right. America will not simply turn over its guns the way Australia did. Gun ownership is a constitutional right.

58,"First of all, not all abortions are abortions of a fetus, most abort an embryo. Second, life is continuous and it never stops or starts. An egg needs to be alive in order to be able to form a zygote. A sperm is also alive. If it dies, it can't fertilize an egg. So life doesn't start at conception, it just continues from one stage to another.

A zygote is not a person. It can split in two and become the potential for two people up to 12 days after fertilization (identical twins). Two zygote can merge and become one person (a chimera). So a blastocyst or a zygote is definitely not a person because chimeras think of themselves as one person and twins think of themselves as separate people.

Is an embryo human? Yes, it is. Human blood is also human. Human hair is human. So being human doesn't mean all that much. Is an embryo a person? I don't think so. Why? Because what defines a person is consciousness. If you don't have your body but you have your consciousness you're still you. What forms consciousness is still not completely known but it's obvious that whatever it is, it takes a developed nervous system that embryos don't yet have. They have the potential for it but they don't have it yet. So they're just that - a potential for a person, not a person yet. ",1,1521822851,2018-03-23 12:34:11

&gt; No, all killing is wrong.

Again, this is the [fallacy of equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) which means your argument--I'll say, for the *third time*--is circular: If ""Wrongful Killing"" is murder, and if all killing is wrong, then all killing is murder, *by definition.* 

&gt; You are able to kill a person who assaults you or enslaves you because they are attacking your body against your will.

This is a basic misunderstanding between two fundamental moral concepts: ""ought"" (what is obligatory) vs. ""can"" (what is possible to do). You're pretty unclear all over the place, but if what you're claiming is that ""***it is morally permissible*** to kill a person who assaults you or enslaves you ***if*** they are attacking your body against your will,"" then the conditional claim holds, but not *exclusively,* since the antecedent of the conditional is *redundant* given the consequent, you see? 

What you should say is:  ""it is morally permissible to kill a person, S, who assaults you or enslaves you, *period*"" but *the reasons why* S performs the action are **morally irrelevant.** Enslavement is a a form of assault or unlawful detainment (even temporary), and is prosecuted as such for good moral reason. 

All forms of assault are an attack; by definition; it's a necessary condition for an action to be a form of assault if it's non-consensual. This is why one and the same action can be assault and not-assault depending on the consent of those who are the recipient of the action. It's why there exist ""safe words"" in sex acts, for example. 

&gt;  It is less wrong to kill them than it is to let them go through with their crime, so you are permitted (not obliged) to do so. 

I don't understand what you're saying here. Is your claim simply that killing is permissible if circumstances permit it (e.g., rape)? Roughly, if an action is permissible under certain circumstances, then it is not wrong according to said conditions. How is this hard or disagreeable?   

&gt; Even in this situation, however, it is better to do ANYTHING else that will stop them rather than kill them.

Sure, I suppose: capturing an enemy is preferable to killing them in war, but often those circumstances are not available when there are considerations of immediacy and threat--e.g., when they're shooting at you. *Sure,* I could *try* to persuade my rapist to not to continue to rape me, but when they are performing the act, then it is obviously permissible to stop them, even if doing so would endanger or kill them. 

&gt; I therefore do not generally believe capital punishment is a good idea and disagree with your statement that ignorance is not innocence.

I don't see how this follows, and I never mentioned capital punishment (I'm firmly against retributive justice); nothing of what I said bears on that. 

If I was unaware that I was committing rape when I was performing the act (say, as a sexomniac), then you're saying the assailant is *not* allowed to kill me because my ignorance *absolves* me of the immorality of my act, or somehow acts as a shield of repercussions? That's a ridiculous view, and thus **of course ignorance is not an excuse.**

&gt; I disagree fully that living inside of a person against their will denies ones right to live due to the fact that you are using their body against their will unknowingly. 

Your pronouns are a bit confusing, but if I'm following you here your claim is that if a person S requires for survival the body of another person P then S is not within their right to deny P the use of their body? Obviously, three people could be saved if my organs were distributed to them today, but that doesn't mean they have a claim to one of my lungs, half of my liver, and one of my kidneys. Furthermore, if you found out that a certain function of your body has been diminished or inhibited in some way because it was discovered that you were carrying your [parasitic twin/autosite inside you,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus_in_fetu) then you're saying that it would be murder to remove it? Ridiculous.

&gt;  Does the fact that someone will almost certainly unintentionally cause someone else bodily harm [...] give you a right to destroy them?

If someone is texting while driving towards me as I cross the road, are you saying that I cannot, **as an act of self-defense,** engage in a countermeasure that would stop them from causing me harm even if it meant possibly killing the driver? The aim is not to kill the driver, but to stop the car from causing harm; if doing the latter causes the former, it's clearly within ones rights to do so. 

Let's say that there is a person R who, for some incredible reason, *needs to rape* in order to live (like a ***hyper-oblivious ""rape vampire""***), and upon committing rape *doesn't know they're engaging in the act* (e.g., as a [sexomniac rapist](https://firenewsfeed.com/news/638858), say), then you're saying that I'm not allowed to stop R from raping me? 

That seems to be a wildly implausable implication of what you've said (however confusedly so). 

&gt; So killing all persons is wrong, yes, but not always impermissible. 

Now I'm confused. Do you mean *all killing of persons is wrong*, or simply killing *all* persons is wrong (i.e., rendering the human race extinct?), but not necessarily impermissible? What are you talking about? (In logic, this is called a ""[scope fallacy""](http://www.fallacyfiles.org/modlscop.html) )

&gt; you cannot kill someone if they, through no fault of their own, cause you inconvenience, especially if you are partially responsible for that person's existence and the inconvenience they are causing you.

I'm not only being inconvenienced by being raped by R, that's for sure. What if R happened to be my great grandchild? I'm ""partially responsible"" for their existence, but it seems that I'm still fully within my rights to deny R my body.

In sum, I think your argument--as much as I can make of it, anyway--is highly problematic on multiple grounds. Your continued *[ad hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc)* contentions are both logically and morally confused.

What is a ""being""?

Is it not in the nature of an egg to encounter a sperm?  In the nature of a sperm to encounter an egg?

Why is it in the nature of a zygote to encounter an endometrial lining?  Why is it in the nature of an implanted embryo to remain on the endometrial lining?  We have abandoned such thought of things having a *nature* like this since Aristotle.

&gt; ""Consciousness"" is ill defined, and I would argue that humans gain it gradually on a spectrum from relatively early in the pregnancy (ability to respond to external stimuli) through infancy (object permanence and self awareness.) Part of my objection to using birth as the cutoff between fetus and human is it's rather arbitrary positioning on the range of mental development.

After all, the potentiality for consciousness exists before conception.  If you're not currently reproducing, you are denying a potential consciousness.

Plenty of natural functions involve major bodily harm. Cancer will naturally occur in every human who doesn't die of something else first. That doesn't mean it's not harmful.

Moreover, the deceased (i.e. the fetus) has to have instigated the attack.  You consider the attack to be pregnancy.  I don't know of any fetuses that caused their own pregnancy.      

Finally, the defendant has to have a reasonable expectation of death or major bodily injury.  I'm sure that you consider pregnancy to be great bodily harm *ipso facto,* but in a legal sense, you cannot consider such a natural function to be major bodily harm.  For one thing, many individuals volunteer for it, and for another thing, pregnancy is literally necessary for the survival of the species.

You do know that ""trespassers will be shot"" is not a legal pronouncement, right?  Plus, the fetus did not trespass under it's own volition.  Abortion would literally be like killing a person for being put on private property while they were unconscious.    

**Murder of Some Sort**

That's going to be difficult to make stick in most abortion cases, and even if you could make a convincing argument, most states don't allow for the execution for manslaughter, which would probably be your best bet.   

**Battery or Domestic Assault**  

This is probably your best bet, and I think you might even be able to convince a jury on this one, but I think you'll have a hard time demonstrating that the fetus wasn't under extreme duress, seeing as it would die without taking up space in the womb.

I'm not sure what I think about the suicide example, but perhaps it could be argued that suicide is usually a result of severe mental illness, not free choice. Stopping someone in the act is thus both saving their life and also safeguarding their bodily autonomy- it's acknowledging the fact that the person probably *isn't* in total control right now and making free choices; they are compelled by sickness. 

And we obviously don't universally prize human life above anything else either. We think it's understandable to kill in self-defense, for example.

Most agree for abortion for sake of the mother's life, but few on the other side of the argument will argue for her quality of life. Pregnancy can result in a woman developing debilitating health problems from prolapse of organs to gestational diabetes, blood clots, etc. You can easily look up the host of health problems that can occur and it's likely a woman with experience at least one of them. Not to mention the likelihood of being ripped from vagina to rectum come the time of delivery. She may survive her pelvis being broken, but that doesn't mean it's ethical to subject her to it against her will.

Easy, if it is not parasitic and depending on forcing another human being to give it life or nutrients from its own body, then it could be determine to be human.

While he is clearly more qualified than I to make this judgement, he does seem to be an outlier, and unless I am mistaken his work in this feild was done in the nineteen seventies, quite a different time in our understanding of brain function.

When we ground the discussion in the reality of late-term abortion, people become a lot less glib.",1,1521683486,2018-03-21 21:51:26
191,"I’m going to answer this as best I can. I’ll admit a fetus is always human. As in the species of human, because it has human dna in its cells. 

You’re asking when a fetus becomes a person and earns rights. This I don’t know, science doesn’t know, and religion doesn’t know. There is really no set point where a switch flips and something becomes a person, however there are some criteria we have chosen to measure this by that some more intelligent animals meet, ie elephants, dolphins, and chimpanzees can all be considered non-human persons. A fetus does not meet these criteria. Moreover a fetus can not be argued that it ever will because up to the last second of pregnancy it can still be a still born. The best way to answer is that personhood is gained in stages and a fetus is at too early a stage to have personhood.

The mother, however, without a doubt has personhood. And this her life and body should come first. There is no 100% effective method of birth control and in the current society, the life of the baby is often put before the life of the mother. Pregnancy is a dangerous and life threatening endeavor from which a woman’s body will never fully recover. She should have a choice whether or not to put her body through these changes and risks. Should her chosen method of birth control fail, that choice is given through abortion at a time too early in development for the fetus to be considered much more than a tumor. 

A mother, having definitive person hood, also has mental health to look after. And an unwanted pregnancy with no way out can put enough stress on her to result suicide. 

You’ve already mentioned the negative social repercussions, so I won’t get into those. 

Tl; Dr: This is my answer to the question of whether or not the fetus is a person. It is not. The mother is. And she reserves the right to life and good quality of life because of it. ",1,1521683027,2018-03-21 21:43:47

193,"&gt; For example, infants don't have much (or any) reasoning ability until well after birth,

Nope. Just because it can't actualize those features doesn't mean it isn't there. Neurophysiologists have made EEG measurements of developing fetuses and prematurely born babies and discovered that the patterns of electrical brain activity prior to the 28th week of development are radically and fundamentally different from those occurring after the 28th week. American neuroscientist Dominick P. Purpura concurs with Rose. In a recent interview, Purpura defined ""brain life"" as ""the capacity of the cerebral cortex, or the thinking portion of the brain, to begin to develop consciousness, self-awareness and other generally recognized cerebral functions as a consequence of the formation of nerve cell circuits."" Brain life, said Purpura, begins between the 28th and 32nd weeks of pregnancy. 

&gt; Also, if you define personhood based on the ability to reason you leave out a lot of people with severe mental disorders. That's another ballpark entirely, but it makes me worry about handing out humanity on the grounds of brain function.

Nope. These people still are human beings. Just because they have a mental disorder or have a damaged brain doesn't mean they still don't have a unique level of human-centric reasoning.

232,"Re: when life starts - Stephanie Gray (a pro-life-er) has a really good argument that life starts at conception. That single cell will grow into a fully formed human, assuming nothing goes wrong (so actually only a small percentage of the time, but hey!). It has human DNA. It is alive in that it is consuming nutrients and attempting to replicate itself. So, it must be alive and it must be human. 

So, yes, I think abortion is killing a life. However, there are many cases where I think its acceptable to kill someone. For example, if someone is trying to stab you, and the only way you can stop them is by shooting them, that's acceptable. You should try not to kill them, but if it's unavoidable, it's acceptable. If someone is raping you, and the only way you can make them stop is by killing them, you're allowed to do that. 

So, if someone is existing inside your uterus, and you don't consent, and the only way to make them stop is to kill them, that's acceptable. If there's a way to make them stop without killing them, I think it's a good idea to try not to. But as it stands, with fetuses, in most cases they cannot survive on their own. But that doesn't make the uterus-bearer responsible for giving up their body to the fetus. For example, there are people who WILL DIE because their kidneys are failing, and if we put one of your kidneys in them, they would NOT DIE and also you would (almost certainly) survive. However, we aren't allowed to force you to give up your kidney without your consent. Similarly, a pregnant person should not be forced to give up their uterus for another human's survival, unless the pregnant person consents. Pregnancies are extremely risky, even in terms of non-lethal effects. They can damage your body and career in lasting ways. The pregnant person has every right to not consent to have another human live inside them and damage their body. They can choose to revoke consent at any point during the pregnancy, just like you can choose at any point during sex to revoke consent and ask the other person to stop.

In your post, you describe reasons why people *should* access early abortion.  They're different from the reasons I would pick -- I would say they should access early abortion because it's safer, faster, and easier (and cheaper!).

But the conclusion you draw is that people who *don't* access early abortion should be legally required to carry their pregnancies to term and deliver.  You've done that by conflating ""should"" and ""should have to"" despite those having very different meanings.

270,"A good starting point is getting some education on what drives second-trimester abortions, and the one thing that is not a contributor is ""knew early on but just couldn't make up my mind"".  Women want to have abortions quickly, and delays in doing so are usually due to not realizing you're pregnant (missed periods are a great indicator for fertile women with regular periods- not so great for women who think they're infertile or who experience either naturally-occurring or birth control-induced amenorrhea) or encountering obstacles in obtaining an abortion early on (like needing to raise funds, be able to take time off work to travel to the clinic, having to wait for the clinic's first open appointment, etc., etc.).

The majority of abortions (88.8%) take place at or before 12 weeks ([source](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states)); those that take place after that are typically due to the aforementioned extenuating circumstances (many of which, it should be noted, could be mitigated by removing the barriers to early abortion access).",1,1521612741,2018-03-21 02:12:21

272,"&gt; I do have a couple of last question, when do you think a new, living human organism begins to exist if not at fertilization and why? What definition of human are you using?

Alright sure. Let’s start the basic dictionary definition of a human being: any individual of the genus Homo. We can see the being a human requires some sort of individuality. It requires being something greater than just an identifier. It requires a semblance of development that makes somebody an individual or a developed human organism. Now what makes something an individual? What makes us a human being so to say? The answer, as provided by many institutions, is the brain. The brain enables our body, our mind, our personality. “The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero (28-36 weeks gestation), until the occurrence of brain death. “At any point human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense.” 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4078859

Thus, being able to identify when the brain develops in the human embryo should have a significant impact on the question of when human life begins. It is clear the science and biology show us that human life begins when the brain starts functioning—we can’t have higher brain function before the brain can operate. Thus it is only logical to conclude that a human being is defined by when higher brain activity is achieved. 

Now at what point would we say the fetus has reached significant brain activity to be considered a human being so to say? Numerous Scientists have put it at around 28 to 32 week as this when the fetus develops significant brain function that differentiates us from animals.

http://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/09/archives/fetal-brain-said-to-live-at-28-weeks-role-of-the-brain-studies.html http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-19/local/me-476_1_brain-stem

So basically based on this idea we can see that the fetus reaches the brain birth criteria to become a human being at around 28 to 31 weeks. Now if we look at Abortion Data we will find that abortions happening beyond 21 weeks represent less than 1.3% of abortions. I would wager that abortions happening in the 28-31 week range are literally non-existent and the abortions that do happen this far are almost always of the case where the mother's life is in danger, or they are medically necessary. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6410a1.htm http://reason.com/blog/2016/10/21/late-term-abortions-in-america-2016

273,"&gt; Here is a list of 40 quotes from varies medical and biology experts that say a new human life begins at conception/fertilization.

Half of which are outdated, from religious and ethical sources and don't actually constitute as evidence. 

Excerpt from Dr. Ricki Lewis, a science writer with a PhD in genetics and biology and author of several textbooks and thousands of articles in scientific, medical, and embryological publications. “Life science textbooks from traditional publishers don’t explicitly state when life begins, because that is a question not only of biology, but of philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, technology, and emotions. Rather, textbooks list the characteristics of life, leaving interpretation to the reader.”

Dr. Scott F. Gilbert, a legendary Embryologist from Swarthmore says “As an embryologist and the author of embryological textbooks, I can say with absolute assurance that there is not scientific support on life beginning at conception, this is not a biological fact”. 

Here is excerpt from a lecture by Dr. Robert Wyman, chair of the Yale Biology department ""There is a lot of false misunderstanding out there, We always hear” It is a scientific fact, as any basic biology text will confirm that life does begin at conception. The fetus is a live human being, distinct from, while dependent on, its mother. It deserves the full protection of its rights."" That's what's common out there. Not only is it what people, most people personally believe, but it's generally considered to be a scientific fact. I've heard this from pro-life people and pro-choice people, almost indistinguishably. The question is--you've all had high school biology at least, how many of you had college biology? A few of you, guess what? That isn't what--that isn't at all what a beginning biology textbook says. What does it say? This is from--they send professors free copies of textbooks, so I just opened up one that they happened to send me, and it shows something quite different. It shows life as a cycle. There's no start point here. Fertilization is one of the events going around the cycle.


This is the essence of sexual reproduction. We also know that there's asexual reproduction, which doesn't have this stuff [fertilization] at all. The cycle is the switch between a haploid genome, which means one copy of each chromosome, and diploid, when each cell has two copies of each chromosome. With sexual reproduction--there's always some version of this one copy/two copies cycle. When we look in detail, this again from the same freshman, very popular, very big selling freshman college biology text. It talks about three different sexual lifecycles. In--the one that you're most familiar with, which is animals. What happens is you start with a--a multi-cellular organism, that's you. Then meiosis--the splitting of the chromosomes so that the gametes get--this is 2N, N being the number of chromosomes, start from 2N, there's a process called meiosis in which pairs split and you get cells with only one copy of each chromosome, those are called gametes or germ cells, and then from another individual you get a second N and you go back to the diploid phase.” - Dr. Robert Wyman 

 http://oyc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/mcdblecture23notes_0.pdf (The full report from Yale on why life does not begin at conception and why textbooks do not say this.) 

From this point on, I will be quoting P.Z Myers a distinguished biologist on this section, because he actually addresses some of the textbooks you mentioned: “Human” in these cases is a general descriptor for the origin of the cells; it’s a statement about the type. You might as well say that that one quote about a “male and female haploid gametes (sperm and egg)” clearly states that sperm and egg are human, therefore science says we ought to criminalize menstruation and masturbation. One other point I have to make about these sources: the Moore and O’Rahilly texts are specifically medical embryology textbooks — they are not good sources for information about general developmental biology, and are a bit blinkered in their perspective, and tend to focus on superficial aspects of descriptive morphology. That’s fine for medical and nursing students, I suppose, but if you want to actually understand the mechanics of development, they’re useless. They’re doubly useless if you read them with an agenda that refuses to be budged by the facts.”

For example let’s look at other examples of scientific literature:

Pass F, Janis R, Marcus DM. (1971) Antigens of human wart tissue. J Invest Dermatol. 56(4):305-10.

Warts are human. Ban squaric acid, laser surgery, and topical liquid nitrogen treatments! (Warts actually are human: they are made of skin cells stimulated into benign overgrowth by incorporation of genetic material from a virus. They also therefore have a unique genetic combination.)

Kim HB, Lee SH, Um JH, Oh WK, Kim DW, Kang CD, Kim SH. (2015) Sensitization of multidrug-resistant human cancer cells to Hsp90 inhibitors by down-regulation of SIRT1. Oncotarget. 2015 Sep 25. [Epub ahead of print]

Cancer cells are human. They are also genetically distinct from their host, with a unique molecular signature.

Finch CE, Austad SN. (2015) Commentary: is Alzheimer’s disease uniquely human? Neurobiol Aging. 36(2):553-5.

Scientists refer to diseases as “human”, too? Do we need to get informed consent and a signature from neurofibrillary plaques in the brain before we can try to treat it?

My point is not that warts, cancer, or diseases need to be regarded as human beings. It’s that “human” is a very broad term that is applied to a lot of kinds of cells, and it takes a particularly naive person to browse through the literature and go “A-ha! My biases are confirmed by this quote!””

So overall. I don’t see how you can say that science has recognized the zygote as a human organisms when all you have done is provided a list of textbooks that don’t actually say what you want them too, and don’t really constitute as evidence in this matter. By the way, your list of textbooks was taken from the infamous Princeton page which is sourced by many pro-life groups such as live action. ",1,1521610937,2018-03-21 01:42:17
274,"&gt; Yes, I am saying that I believe that they are wrong. 

You believe the hundreds of thousands of doctors around the world here are wrong? This isn't just a U.S thing, this is a worldwide issue where this agreement. There may be secular/nonreligious arguments for being against abortion in the context of early-stage fetuses, just as there can be for a flat earth., But there are no logical, ethical or rational ones. I used to think the same way with adoption as an alternative but it simply isn't. All these arguments are logically scientifically and ethically untenable. Abortion is a basic human right, it's universally recognized including by the UN and pretty much every women's rights organization for very good reasons. The anti-abortion stance is human rights abuse. But if not well read on the issue it's easy to think the opposite. We don't give rights to cells, if you have understood dolly the sheep cloning you should know that pretty much all cells can technically give rise to a person. The idea that a cell is a person therefore would mean that killing any cell is equivalent to killing a person. You have to see what it is at that stage. And that is a cell. In terms of sentience or personhood it is closer to/at the same level of any diploid cell than a person. To suggest that just bc it has the natural ability to develop is an appeal to nature fallacy bc as demo started in the dolly cloning example, all cells have the natural ability to form individuals. That one cell has more natural ability and therefore should be given rights is to make an appeal to nature fallacy bc just bc something is natural doesn't make it ethical. Also take the example of bees, many bees develop from a haploid/unfertilzed egg meaning life doesn't begin at conception.

Also you either believe a woman has the right to determine whether she wants kids or not. As long as a person isn't harmed it is morally neutral. A cell or a clump of cells prior to sentience stage is mo more ethically problematic than any other cell. Abortion in the early stages is no more problematic than removing any other cell or organ from the body.

To understand sentience and the ethical framework for abortion check out these couple of articles. This explains it rather well:

http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2013/06/26/fetal-pain-laws-scientific-and-constitutional-controversy/

While this is the scientific basis, a meta analysis on the sentience aspect http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429

You can be sure that when the overwhelming majority of ethicists, scientists, the united nations, every human right organization and secular society as a whole has taken a position that is against what religion has advocated. 

&gt; We know that society as a whole has been wrong on many things in the past.

Sure, and we know why they were wrong. I am not arguing about society's views, I am arguing from the medical community as a whole. 

&gt;  I mean, slavery was widely accepted in the US and most of the world not to long ago. 

People supported slavery because of religious notions and because of racial attitudes. I never invoked any religious justification for my arguments. 

&gt; And doctors, lawyers, ethical philosophers and the like all supported it.

Source? Because many ethical philosophers at the time were actually *against* slavery. http://www.realhistories.org.uk/articles/archive/philosophy.html

&gt; But they were wrong so it's not a stretch to think that they are wrong now.

I am confident a bunch of slave owners using the bible to justify slavery would be wrong. I am not confident that hundreds of thousands of doctors around the world using biology, neurology, and evidence to justify their pro-choice stance are wrong. 

&gt; It's not about when life begins. A sperm is life and so is an egg. But a sperm and an egg are not a new or unique organism.

Sure, and I believe I addressed this with several arguments. I brought up the twinning example. The most popular argument against the idea that life begins at the moment of fertilization has been dubbed the ""twinning argument."" The main point of this argument is that although a zygote is genetically unique from its parents from the moment a diploid organism is formed; it is possible for that zygote to split into two or more zygotes up until 14 or 15 days after fertilization. Even though the chances of twinning are not very great, as long as there is the potential for it to occur the zygote has not completed the process of individuation and is not an ontological individual. Suppose that an egg is fertilized. At that moment a new life begins; the zygote gains a ""soul,"" in the Catholic line of thought, or ""life"" in a secular line of thought. Then suppose that the zygote splits to form twins. Does the soul of the zygote split as well? No, this is impossible. Yet no one would argue that twins share the same ""soul"" or the same ""life."" Thus, supporters of this view maintain that the quality of ""soul"" or ""life"" must be conferred after there is no longer any potential for twinning.

&gt; Do you see what I am getting at here? I am not sure if I am really explaining my point properly. I think there may be some misunderstanding going on here. Let me know.

No, I understand your point so far. Thanks for being civil and not breaking the rules.

277,"PART 2 OF MY RESPONSE

&gt; relate the term human being to a societal philosophy and is throwing biological definition out the window.

I provided a scientific definition of human being that actually fits with reasonable criteria. Even your own definition has the word individual which constitutes something greater than a basic cell. When you say that “Life begins at fertilization/conception” you are saying that a human being exists at the moment when haploid human gametes fuse into a fertilized diploid human egg. Saying life begins at conception basically means that a single cell is in fact a human being. There is a reason not a single scientific organization supports this idea. Sometime in the not very distant future, probably in our quest to understand cancer, we will discover the mechanisms for unlocking the genetic code which prevents unchecked cell division. Since every single human cell contains the full genetic information of every other cell, it will become possible to take a skin cell and cause it to divide and differentiate into any desired organ, or even into a complete human being, genetically identical to the donor. The process is called 'cloning'. Will we then say that every skin cell is a human being? Rather should we not say that both zygotes and skin cells represent potential human beings with differing probabilities of actually becoming a full human? Valuing the point of conception is an unreasonable scientific position, it should be realized that one is putting a premium on is a potential and probability for humanness, and that it is not necessarily true that a fertilized egg is in fact a full human being at conception. 

&gt; I don’t see why? Being a human being does not necessitate the inability to split?

I don't think you understand the issue here. Let me explain this more thoroughly again. The main point of this argument is that although a zygote is genetically unique from its parents from the moment a diploid organism is formed; it is possible for that zygote to split into two or more zygotes up until 14 or 15 days after fertilization. Even though the chances of twinning are not very great, as long as there is the potential for it to occur the zygote has not completed the process of individuation and is not an ontological individual. 

&gt; That does not negate the reality that the first human organism was also a whole, new and human being.

Except it does. The argument that human life begins at the moment that chromosomes of the sperm meet the chromosomes of the egg to form a genetically unique individual is also endangered by the twinning argument because genetic uniqueness is not a requirement for an individual human life. ""Genetic uniqueness"" can be shared by multiple individuals, particularly identical twins. Thus, this argument continues, the moment at which a unique individual human form is the not the moment when its genetic code is determined, but rather the moment when the zygote can no longer split into multiple individuals. In addition to twinning, there are other complexities that further confound the idea of the moment of conception. Just as it possible for a zygote to form two or more individuals before it is implanted in the uterus, it is also possible for it to not continue to develop at all, but rather just become a part of the placenta.  It is estimated that more than 50% of the fertilized eggs abort spontaneously and never become children. Or, if the zygote splits into multiple zygotes, it is also possible for these to recombine before implantation. All of these possibilities are examples of the ways in which the individuation of the zygote is incomplete until it has been implanted in the uterus.

&gt; Well, no that’s not true. And that’s the beauty of math and science. It proves our faulty logic wrong all the time.

Science is ever-changing, but there are some basic biological principles as well as universal laws that the physical universe and all it's laws follow. I have outlined here a logical issue in the development of a zygote that is transferable to the biological scale. You can't just sidestep this issue. 

&gt; As I mentioned before this is only in the USA and I am not interested in reviewing the study because education does not make one’s opinions more relevant. 

The USA is a big part in the abortion debate, considering most other western nations have a pro-life movement or abortion debate that is as large as the one present in the United States. The fact that those that are higher educated and more trained in the sciences are Pro-Choice show that there is a clearly a dominant factor in being pro-choice. This is clearly a factor in that we see higher educated people being correct on issues such as gay marriage, evolution and climate change. 

&gt; Especially when discussing abortion which is a moral issue.

You just tried to make a biological case for abortion and now you are saying it's a moral issue. Pick one. 

&gt; No it’s not religious. 


Actually, it is a religious group, considering the majority of their membership is religious and a lot of their initiatives are faith-based. I outlined some of their faith-based and psudeo religious initiatives and showed why they failed.

&gt; You do not have to be religious to be pro-life. Please stop trying to bring religion into this.

I never said this. I only made the point that the **majority** of the pro-life movement is religious. 

&gt;  I am starting to think that you are not really interested in an honest discussion here. It seems like you are literally just making stuff up.

Really? I have provided citations for everything I said. In your previous comments you made several dishonest claims, and then you tried to pass off a religious special interest group and a student group pro-life page as actual evidence. If this was an actual debate, you would have been disqualified for intellectual dishonesty. Please stop projecting. 

&gt; Um, the quotes are all from biology textbooks and resources. You can easily look each one of them up.

I already showed you how these quotes are essentially not valid when it comes to premise of this debate. Please go back and read the lecture I sent you by Dr. Robert Wyman. Also a lot of the Doctors you cited are highly active in the pro-life movement and many have made false statements such as here: 
http://inthesetimes.com/duly-noted/entry/15397/the_fetal_pain_argument/

&gt; Nice try. The medical organization has not been debunked and the quotes from that page are all from biology texts and resources.

278,"&gt; Sorry but I don’t see where it says that he is a biologist or embryologist. 

Once again, read what I said. His training and fields of expertise involve biology and embryology. As someone who is skilled in reproductive medicine, he is someone who has gone through medical training and has the biological knowledge when it comes to making this types of authoritative statements. If you actually read his scientific paper, you will see he is appealing to scientific and biological evidence to make his case. 

&gt; Being a fertility specialist, it is no doubt in his best financial interest to argue prochoice rhetoric.

I don't think you should be making this point when you literally cited two groups with that are specifically pro-life. Dr. Paulson is arguing his position based on scientific facts. An excerpt from his article: *""Trying to decide whether information is accurate may be challenging. Those of us who live in the world of science and who use scientific journals to obtain information enjoy some protection from disinformation, which is afforded us by peer review and explicit scrutiny of the scientific data presented. Unfortunately, the subsequent dissemination of scientific studies by the lay media has no such protection. And thus, on an almost daily basis, we hear of results of ‘‘scientific studies’’ that seem hard to believe, which are then quickly contradicted by reports of other ‘‘scientific studies.’’ The consequence of such apparent scientific contradictions is that the lay listener develops skepticism about the scientific method, and concludes that science, like the news media, is not a reliable source of information. When we scientists do not speak up to correct the unscientific conclusions attributed to science, we are complicit in the spread of such disinformation, leading to the undermining of science credibility in general.""* 

And that is the point. Standing up for science the post-truth era. 

&gt; When I refer to human I mean a homo sapien. Distinguishable by it’s dna.

I already showed how this view fails multiple times. Mere possession of the genetic material for a future human being does not make a human being. The developing embryo that becomes a fetus that becomes a baby is the product of a dynamic interaction with its environment in the womb, it's postnatal experiences, and a host of other factors. A purely genetic description of the human species does not describe a human being. A human being represents a whole other level of organization, as distinct from a simple embryo as an embryo is distinct from an egg and sperm. It is the dynamics between genes and environment that make a human being. 

&gt;  they are a collection of human cells, but not a human organism.

I think we need to clarify the differences in what constitutes a human being here. your definition of a human being seems to be unclear and contradictory. If it is truly based on being a unique organism with its own DNA, being human, than as I showed earlier, I am pretty sure Warts would fit that definition as well, on the basis of their human identifier and unique genetic combination. 

A fertilized egg, or zygote, is a cell that has unique mixture of DNA and has the potential to become an individual lifeform in the future. But it cannot do it alone. It needs nourishment and specific physical and chemical environment in order to grow. 

We slough off individual cells from our bodies all the time, we don't call them living organisms, partly because, though they have our full genome, they are already differentiated and specialized types. And then the cell divides, and divides again and again. The number increases exponentially. It forms a hollow ball of cells called a blastula. But again, it's hard to call it an individual organism at this stage because it is still just a bunch of cells, with basically no structure. Women have miscarriages at this stage all the time without even knowing it.

To argue that life begins at conception is to say there is a potential for a human being to form. (I provided a refutation to the Potentiality argument earlier). To say life begins at brain waves however is to say that an actual living human being is formed. 


Skin cells are human cells. They possess human DNA. They are alive; they are living. They are not a human being.

Liver cells are human cells. They possess human DNA. They are alive; they are living. They are not a human being.

Stem cells are human cells. They possess human DNA. They are alive; they are living. They are not a human being.

Spermatozoa are human cells. They possess human DNA. They are alive; they are living. They are not a human being.

Zygotes are human cells. They possess human DNA. They are alive; they are living. They are not a human being.

Human beings, like jellyfish and green-blue algae, are colonies. No single cell of ours is a human being or ever could be. Why? Because human beings are colonies with specific expected finished characteristics.

An embryo is made of human cells. It possesses human DNA. It is alive; it is living. It is even a colony. But it is not a fully differentiated colony. It is still developing. It is not a human being, but it may develop into one. Because it is developing, and because it is wholly dependent on the woman who must carry it, and because it has the capacity to do great and irreparable harm to that woman, she has the right to choose not to carry it. She may choose, at any point in her carrying, to revoke the embryo’s permit to inhabit her body. Why? Because a woman has human cells. A woman possesses human DNA. She is alive; she is living. She is a full colony. She has developed EEG waves. A woman is a human being. She is recognized under the law as owning her own body. And that woman is more important than any potential children she may have. Once those children have been born, they become equally important; but they are never, never more important than she is.

&gt; But it is life by the biological definition. It meets the criteria and thus, is considered alive.

But what kind of biological definition are you using? When we are discussing embryology, I don’t think a basic biological definition will constitute. There are a lot different things that contribute to making something a human being. One of these things is behavioral states. A recent study tried to determine if a fetus has the ability to have behavioral states. They conducted a longitudinal study, “fetal eye movements, visualized by means of real-time ultrasonic imaging, and fetal heart rate patterns, recorded by means of a cardiotocograph” were observed as variable to see if a fetus experienced these states like a newborn human. These were confirmed to appear at the same cognitive function occurred when an EEG wave appeared. Thus giving more evidence to the Brain Birth position. 

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378378282901062

Technically, embryos do not fit the scientific criteria for life. First of all, they have not developed any reproductive organs. Second, they do not respond to stimuli. The individual cells do not yet even have a specific function. The individual cells might respond to some stimuli, but the embryo as a whole does not. It is more like a colony of unspecified cells just hanging there, and cells are not quite considered living organisms. There are single celled organisms, but they are almost always prokaryotes (bacteria). Plus, most people don't care about single celled life. Otherwise, people would be considered to be committing mass genocide every time they washed their hands. Even multicellular organisms, such as flies, bees, and mosquitoes, all of which are far more advanced than the embryo and are all considered living beings, are killed off en masse without so much as a second thought. What makes the embryo better than a mosquito? What about rats and mice, people kill them all the time without a second thought, and they are mammals with some semblance of brains. The difference is higher brain activity that differs us from animals. 

&gt; Of course there is evidence to suggests it’s human. It’s dna is that of a homo sapien.

Once again, having a human DNA doesn't necessarily mean one is a human being. The brain, specifically the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, is the part of the body that differentiates us from other species. The brain enables our body, our mind, our personality and, many argue, our right to life. Thus, being able to identify when the brain develops in the human embryo should have a significant impact on the question of when human life begins. It is clear the science and biology show us that human life begins when the brain starts functioning—we can’t have higher brain function before the brain can operate. Organized brain activity is the critical function needed to determine humanness (referring to becoming a human being) because it is a quality that, in its fullness with all its implications for self-identity, personal narrative, and other mental constructs, is uniquely human. 

&gt; Well first of all, it seems like you are just copying and pasting so it’s kind of hard to take your response seriously.

If I haven't cited something, it something I have come up with or drafted together on my own that has been in use in a previous argument and is finding its use here due to relevanace. I honestly think this is just an excuse from your end, because I am providing scientific evidence that clearly makes a case for my point.

282,"**Death of Savita Halappanavar**

Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old dentist, originally from India, died on 28 October 2012 at University Hospital Galway in Ireland due to the complications of a septic miscarriage at 17 weeks' gestation. The miscarriage took seven days to unfold, and early in the process, when it was clear that the miscarriage was inevitable, Halappanavar requested an abortion. At that time the medical team had not diagnosed her with a blood infection, and her request was denied because the medical team did not judge that her life was in danger. The medical team eventually did diagnose the sepsis and began trying to treat it, and when they determined that Halappanavar's life was in danger they had planned to administer misoprostol to induce delivery, but the miscarriage completed before they were able to.

Obviously, the Church has very specific rules that I think even some anti-abortion folks would disagree with (their policies, for example, led to the death of [Savita Halappanavar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar)), but the stories Lori shares are quite illustrative of just how poorly actual practice of medicine fits in with black-and-white laws.  in essence, it's very naive to think that an emergent situation will be viewed the same by all doctors or that the best course of action in their opinion will be the same, and it should worry us all what kind of chilling effect fear of prosecution for a crunch-time decision will have.

As this issue is diagnosed later in pregnancy it becomes more and more dangerous for the woman as the “birth” cannot be assisted by the baby. She went on to have two healthy children.

Let's just look at the demographics between those who are pro-life and those who identify as Pro-choice.

According to Pew opposition to abortion (making it illegal in all or most cases) is the weakest among liberal Democrats at 8%, among the religiously nonaffiliated it is only 17% among college grads it is 29%.

Conversely, opposition to abortion (making it illegal in all or most cases) is the strongest among conservative Republicans at 71%. among white evangelicals it is 70%, among those with a high school education or less it is 53%.

So, the facts show that liberal, college educated, non-religious pro-lifers are very much the minority and the vast majority of the pro-life movement is made up conservative, lesser educated, religious folks.

So, if the pro-life movement is based on basic biology that has nothing to do with religion, why are so few non-religious college graduates in the movement?

Better yet, if your movement is based on ""basic biology, why are there no major groups with names like ""biologists for life"" or ""pro-life embryologists""? Why do the majority of reputable medical organization in the world support a women's right to choose? Its okay to have different opinions, but not different facts.

Thank you for the discussion. I will consider your points. I think I am starting to see that we might be discussing two different things. I think we might be misunderstanding each other. 

Hope something I have said helped clarify my position. If you have any questions let me know.

I do have a couple of last question, when do you think a new, living human organism begins to exist if not at fertilization and why? What definition of human are you using?

Thanks again.

20. “The first cell of a new and unique human life begins existence at the moment of conception (fertilization) when one living sperm from the father joins with one living ovum from the mother. It is in this manner that human life passes from one generation to another. Given the appropriate environment and genetic composition, the single cell subsequently gives rise to trillions of specialized and integrated cells that compose the structures and functions of each individual human body.

“Every human being alive today and, as far as is known scientifically, every human being that ever existed, began his or her unique existence in this manner, i.e., as one cell. If this first cell or any subsequent configuration of cells perishes, the individual dies, ceasing to exist in matter as a living being. There are no known exceptions to this rule in the field of human biology.”

337,"Ok, I just seen this. My response is pretty simple. Yes, I am saying that I believe that they are wrong. This form of argument does not mean much to me. We know that society as a whole has been wrong on many things in the past. I mean, slavery was widely accepted in the US and most of the world not to long ago. And doctors, lawyers, ethical philosophers and the like all supported it. But they were wrong so it's not a stretch to think that they are wrong now. So, I am not really swayed by this line of reasoning.

In the end, I was really only interested in discussing when a new living human organism begins to exist. Sure life is a continuum, we know that. But obviously there is a misunderstanding about the prolife point of view. It's not about when life begins. A sperm is life and so is an egg. But a sperm and an egg are not a new or unique organism. 

Do you see what I am getting at here? I am not sure if I am really explaining my point properly. I think there may be some misunderstanding going on here. Let me know. ",1,1521471928,2018-03-19 11:05:28
338,"
&gt;Um, what? Dr. Paulson is an actual embryologist and has biological training and expertise. Let's take a look at some of his qualifications.

Sorry but I don’t see where it says that he is a biologist or embryologist. Can you link me to that because I’ve searched and I don’t see it? I think it says he earned his degree in physics which is quite impressive but not the same thing. Either way, his credentials can’t change scientific facts so it’s a moot point. Being a fertility specialist, it is no doubt in his best financial interest to argue prochoice rhetoric. But again, a moot point because none of this changes the science.

&gt;This is a tricky concept within itself which is why Dr. Paulson was mainly focusing on the issue of there being a continuum. For example, what do you mean by ""human organism""?... 

When I refer to human I mean a homo sapien. Distinguishable by it’s dna. When I refer to organism I mean a whole, living entity, distinguishable by it’s actions. In regard to the molar pregnancy or tumor I would say the following. Being that a molar pregnancy  contains only paternally derived chromosomes, they are distinguishable from zygotes based on their molecular composition. Moreover, hydatidiform moles behave quite differently from embryos: they grow as a chaotic mass of disorganized cells and tissues, all of which are unrelated to each other or to anything resembling a whole. Despite the fact that hydatidiform moles are generated from human gametes, they do not exhibit an embryonic pattern of organization or molecular composition; they are a collection of human cells, but not a human organism. Biologist know this which is why they are given another name. This is the beauty of science, we can look at things objectively and categorize them accordingly.

&gt;Relevant to human development, we know that a huge percentage of blastocysts (the balls of cells just after fertilization) are non-viable and will be flushed out of the uterus...

The blastocysts does not become cancerous. It already has the makeup of a tumor from it’s conception. As noted above it only contains paternally derived chromosomes. So I do not think you are phrasing your question with a proper understanding. In terms of miscarriages, I don’t see how they are equivalent to an abortion at all? Miscarriages are not intentional killings. It’s the difference between dying of natural causes and homicide. 

&gt;Life is not a state but an activity; the nature of the life of a living organism is indicated by the nature of its activity. If the life of the zygote - or rather, the life of its individual cells - is not yet human life, there ought to be evidence at some later stage of a change of nature from the not-yet-human- to the human.

But it is life by the biological definition. It meets the criteria and thus, is considered alive. The author has not given any evidence that it is not life or that it does not meet the definition of life in anyway. 

&gt;... but there is no evidence from its activity to suggest that the life of this new organism is human. 

Of course there is evidence to suggests it’s human. It’s dna is that of a homo sapien. I really don’t understand what you are saying here?

&gt;... It is not the activity we mean when we speak of human life.  
Once could argue unique brain function is when we reach the point where a fetus displays the functions for what is considered the criteria of what it means to be a human being.

Well first of all, it seems like you are just copying and pasting so it’s kind of hard to take your response seriously. But if you review what has been written here you will see that the author is trying to relate the term human being to a societal philosophy and is throwing biological definition out the window. For this very reason it can not be taken seriously. I think it’s pretty clear that he is trying to sidestep his argument from a biological one to a philosophical one.

&gt;That is a problem here too. The view that a human organism comes into existence at—or at the end of—fertilization is logically untenable and unscientific, because a fertilized egg may split and produce twins...

I don’t see why? Being a human being does not necessitate the inability to split? 

&gt;In the case of twinning, neither of the two humans that eventually develop can be identified as the same human as the zygote, because they can’t both be so, as they are different humans from one another. It is logically impossible for one organism to be identical to two organisms. 

I don’t agree. Having a different beginning does not make you a non human organism. In fact, it is more realistic to say that one human organisms existed and then at a later time gave rise (split) to create a new human organism. The point of splitting merely marks a second human organism coming into existence. That does not negate the reality that the first human organism was also a whole, new and human being.

&gt;And, of course, anything that is logically impossible is biologically impossible. 

Well, no that’s not true. And that’s the beauty of math and science. It proves our faulty logic wrong all the time. Black holes, time dialation and metamorphosis are all things that seem logically impossible but happen in physical reality.

&gt;In twinning, two (or more) twins come from a single fertilized egg. But neither of the twins is identical to that fertilized egg...

Actually I am pretty certain that A, B and C are all genetically identical. They are only distinguishable by their physical location and way the individual organisms behave. So I really think you are confused on this point.
 
&gt;While I understand that, I think the overall data shows that education, especially at the graduate level consistently correlates with Pro-Choice views. While you don't need a good education to be intelligent, intelligence as a whole usually correlates with a high amount of education. While your personal experiences are relevant, they do not impact the data that I presented. You still have to deal with the choice that as a whole the pro-life movement is uneducated and highly religious compared to the pro-choice movement. Which shows that as a whole the Pro-Choice perspective correlates with higher education and intelligence.

As I mentioned before this is only in the USA and I am not interested in reviewing the study because education does not make one’s opinions more relevant. Especially when discussing abortion which is a moral issue. 
 
&gt;I was under the impression we were focusing on the abortion debate in the U.S.

I thought we were discussing the fact that biology marks fertilization as the beginning of a new human organism. 
 
&gt;Your first citation was from the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Which is a religious special interest group. 
 
No it’s not religious. You do not have to be religious to be prolife. Please stop trying to bring religion into this. I am starting to think that you are not really interested in a honest discussion here. It seems like you are literally just making stuff up.

&gt;As for your second link. That is not an actual published page by Princeton University, it is simply a website used by the school's student pro-life group. The University itself does not express those views.
 
Um, the quotes are all from biology textbooks and resources. You can easily look each one of them up. Many quoted from doctors with much more credential then Dr. Paulson. And as I mentioned before, any and every biological resource will tell you the same thing. 
 
&gt;So in summation, you gave me a debunked medical ""organization"" and student pro-life page. Not very credible if you ask me.
 
Nice try. The medical organization has not been debunked and the quotes from that page are all from biology texts and resources.
 
See [here](https://bdfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wi_whitepaper_life_print.pdf, [here](http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_illustrated.php), [here](https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/life-issues/when-human-life-begins). 
 
The last one is from your trusted resource AOCG. They themselves admit in the abstract that, 
&gt;“the predominance of human biological research confirms that human life begins at conception—fertilization. “

If you don’t get that the definition if human, living and organisms are biological in nature and open for revision and that the scientific community agrees that a new human organism begins to exist at fertilization then I think you are just deciding to bury your head in the sand. I mean, I’ve talked to many prochoicers and most understand this fact. It’s silly to me to try and deny it. I think at this point we are at a standstill but thanks for the talk. Hopefully you’ll look deeper into this issue. This one doctor is trying to push for his definition but does so in a dishonest way. By changing the debate from a biological to a philosophical one. It’s pretty sleazy and misleading.

In the end, we all know when a new living human being comes into existence. The abortion debate is not about that. That’s a question of biology. The abortion debate is about which human beings are worthy of rights and protection. That is a different conversation all together. And the one that I believe should be had between the two camps.

351,"Part 3 and Final Response:

&gt;  I think your biased has blocked you from actually analyzing and understanding it. 

Careful there. You tried to cite a debunked religious organization, a student pro-life group, random polls from super Catholic nations, and then tried to pass it off as evidence for your viewpoint. Don't accuse me of bias here. 

&gt; Obgyns are not biologist. They are medical doctors. These are very different things. 

Sure they are in theory. But the reality is, they both have very similar expertise and are relevant to the issue of abortion. The doctor I cited, in this case, has the relevant experience concerning this argument. But if you are interested in what a Biologist has to say, I have one here too:

""The idea that ""life begins at conception"" is not a scientific one. Since the disproof of 'spontaneous generation' (1668-1859), we have known that life only derives from life. Life arose billions of years ago and has continued since as a cycle. Assigning a beginning to a cycle (like the year) is arbitrary.""

-- Dr. Robert Wyman, (Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 1998‑present Program Director, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Undergraduate Science Education Program, 1989‑present Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 1980‑1998)

Can't pull a higher rank in biology then Dr. Wyman if you ask me.

&gt; What I am suggesting is that you pick up a biology textbook

Here is an excerpt from a lecture by Dr. Robert Wyman, chair of the Yale Biology department (the guy I just cited above) ""There is a lot of false misunderstanding out there, We always hear” It is a scientific fact, as any basic biology text will confirm that life does begin at conception. The fetus is a live human being, distinct from, while dependent on, its mother. It deserves the full protection of its rights."" That's what's common out there. Not only is it what people, most people personally believe, but it's generally considered to be a scientific fact....The question is--you've all had high school biology at least, how many of you had college biology? A few of you, guess what? That isn't what--that isn't at all what a beginning biology textbook says. What does it say? This is from--they send professors free copies of textbooks, so I just opened up one that they happened to send me, and it shows something quite different. It shows life as a cycle. There's no start point here. Fertilization is one of the events going around the cycle.

This is the essence of sexual reproduction. We also know that there's asexual reproduction, which doesn't have this stuff [fertilization] at all. The cycle is the switch between a haploid genome, which means one copy of each chromosome, and diploid, when each cell has two copies of each chromosome. With sexual reproduction--there's always some version of this one copy/two copies cycle. When we look in detail, this again from the same freshman, very popular, very big selling freshman college biology text. It talks about three different sexual lifecycles. 

http://oyc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/mcdblecture23notes_0.pdf

And finally, I saw nothing in your final link that says ""a human being/organism is formed at fertilization"". It only discuss the vague notion of human development at different stages. But I will take your advice and stick with the biological coursework that is being taught at Yale University, (one of the most prestigious universities in the world) that is being taught by one of the most prestigious and reputable bioligists in the world.

&gt; I don't agree that most medical organizations support abortion rights. 

Really? Let's take a look at what the Premier Medical Organizations have to say about Abortion. 

* The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), composed of around 58,000 medical personnel, state that abortion is reproductive health care. The AAPLOG that you mentioned earlier, is a religious offshoot of the ACOG and is no longer affiliated with the main, more scientifically literate, nonmagical-thinking health organization.

""ACOG has long recognized that abortion is an essential component of health care for millions of women, and has opposed legislative interference into health decision-making. Many years ago, the United States Supreme Court decided that the state has no right to interfere with these decisions, as they are between a patient and her physician.""
""Induced abortion is an essential component of women's health care. Like all medical matters, decisions regarding abortion should be made by patients in consultation with their healthcare providers and without undue interference by outside parties. Like all patients, women obtaining an abortion are entitled to privacy, dignity, respect, and support.""

* The American Medical Women's Association [AMWA] will oppose efforts to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade, either directly or indirectly, as in the case of legislation which burdens access to the abortion procedure. AMWA considers all such laws and court rulings to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and thus to violate medical autonomy and pose threats to the individual as well as the public health.""

Well would you look at that! Literally every mainstream medical organization in the U.S supports the right to choose! I can't wait for you to tell me that all these hundreds of thousands of doctors are wrong, and your 2500 strong debunked religious organization and student pro-life group are correct.

&gt;  Seehere. 70% of Italian doctors refuse to perform abortion.

Italy is a predominately Catholic Country... I am not surprised at all. But thank you for the link, because if you had read the article you would see. The majority of doctors in other European Countries support the right to choose:  
https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-and-polls/overview?id=7150

&gt; In fact, most of the rest of the world restrict abortion. In Europe it is illegal (with exception for life) after 12 weeks.

Actually, though this is official European Law, it's very easy to get abortions past this stage. The de-facto abortion laws are very different than the de-jure laws that have been established.

These are all Catholic Countries. Once again I am not surprised. Fun note btw

You just gave me examples of countries that were suffering under their current abortion laws, and are now making steps to fix it. Not helping your case if you ask me.

At the end of the day, I don't really see how political and religious demographics of the nation show how support for abortion is equated with intelligence, education and professional medical organizations. Let's look at what the premier medical organization has to say on this matter:

* The WMA (World Medical Association) 
“recognizes that unwanted pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced can have a serious adverse effect on the health of a woman and of her children. These adverse effects can include the premature deaths of women. Existing children in the family can also suffer starvation, neglect or abandonment resulting in their death or impaired health, when families are unable to provide for all their children. Social functioning and the ability to reach their full potential can also be impaired.
The WMA recognizes the benefits for women who are able to control their fertility. They should be helped to make such choices themselves, as well as in discussion with their partners. The ability to do so by choice and not chance is a principal component of women's physical and mental health and social well being.
Restrictive abortion laws are not associated with lower abortion rates. In countries where induced abortion is highly restricted by law, safe abortion has frequently become the privilege of the rich, while poor women are left with little choice but to resort to unsafe providers."" 

https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-statement-on-family-planning-and-the-right-of-a-woman-to-contraception/

And there you have it. The world's top medical organization, representing over 11 million worldwide physicians and medical organizations is pretty clear on where it stands when it comes to abortion. I think the case is pretty close. ",1,1521317170,2018-03-17 16:06:10

&gt; I don't agree. Perhaps more credible than a regular person but not nearly as credible as an actual biologist or embryologist

Um, what? Dr. Paulson is an actual embryologist and has biological training and expertise. Let's take a look at some of his qualifications.

* Dr. Paulson has been rated one of “The Best Doctors in America” continuously since 1994. 
* He has published several landmark investigations addressing the effect of age upon female fertility, 
* The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Inc. (Reproductive Endocrinology), 1988 Certification 
* The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Inc. (Obstetrics and Gynecology), 1987 Certification

http://uscfertility.org/about-usc-fertility/richard-j-paulson-md/

I just gave a few highlights. TLDR: This guys is literally one of the most reputable doctors in the country and has published landmark research in regards to the issue of fertilization of and reproductive medicine. I would wager he is probably one of the highest levels of citeable experts we could get when it comes to the Abortion Debate.

&gt; I don't see how this demonstrates his point at all. Of course, an egg and sperm are alive. The question is when a new and living human organism begins to exist. 

This is a tricky concept within itself which is why Dr. Paulson was mainly focusing on the issue of there being a continuum. For example, what do you mean by ""human organism""? Science by its nature is fairly open-ended and you need to define proper terms for this debate. For example, Science can tell us what a ball of cells looks like at various stages of development, but it doesn't tell us what to call it. That is because science is not a collection of facts handed down from on high, but a method by which we learn about the world. Science can definitely inform our terminology, however. For instance, we know that ""human organism"" is a much messier term than you might expect. For example, let's look at tumors. They are genetically distinct, and some of them can live in a petri dish. Some tumors are communicable; are those parasitic organisms, or are they just balls of cells? Relevant to human development, we know that a huge percentage of blastocysts (the balls of cells just after fertilization) are non-viable and will be flushed out of the uterus. If I remember right, it's around 50% or higher. Occasionally, a blastocyst that doesn't get flushed out can become cancerous. Is that cancer an ""individual human organism?"" Even if the blastocyst is viable, miscarriages are very common. Are those all ""individual human organisms"" that are dying? It is also possible in many mammals, if a pregnant female is under stress, for the uterus to reject a fetus. It has been suggested that this can happen in humans. Should the woman be held accountable for murder if this happens? 

&gt; Why is it that it is not a living human organism? 

Life is not a state but an activity; the nature of the life of a living organism is indicated by the nature of its activity. If the life of the zygote - or rather, the life of its individual cells - is not yet human life, there ought to be evidence at some later stage of a change of nature from the not-yet-human- to the human. That change would be evident in the becoming present of new activities, or of new abilities giving the potentiality for new activities: not a change of activity such that some ability already latent begins to show itself, but a change which indicates that new abilities and therefore new potentialities have become present. The second answer to be sought, therefore, is whether at any stage in the process of development there is any such evidence of a change of nature. The commencement of cellular differentiation is evidence that the embryo has now become organized, but there is no evidence from its activity to suggest that the life of this new organism is human. Building the new body by cellular replication according to genetic instructions interacting with environmental factors is no more than the cellular activity which will continue to build and maintain and repair the body tissues for many years to come. It is not the activity we mean when we speak of human life. Once could argue unique brain function is when we reach the point where a fetus displays the functions for what is considered the criteria of what it means to be a human being. 



&gt; Because it can split?

That is a problem here too. The view that a human organism comes into existence at—or at the end of—fertilization is logically untenable and unscientific, because a fertilized egg may split and produce twins. If it is even physically possible for a fertilized egg to produce twins (whether it actually does so or not), a fertilized egg cannot be identical to an organism. As long as it is possible to twin, a zygote is not a human anything, but a cell cluster. In the case of twinning, neither of the two humans that eventually develop can be identified as the same human as the zygote, because they can’t both be so, as they are different humans from one another. It is logically impossible for one organism to be identical to two organisms. And, of course, anything that is logically impossible is biologically impossible. In twinning, two (or more) twins come from a single fertilized egg. But neither of the twins is identical to that fertilized egg, on pain of contradiction. To see this, suppose that a zygote (a cell cluster) divides and twins result. Call the zygote “A,” and one of the twins “B” and the other twin “C.” If A were identical to both B and C, then—by the transitivity of identity—B and C would be identical to each other. But B is clearly not identical to C. Therefore, A (the zygote) cannot be identical to B and C. A human organism cannot come into existence until there is no further possibility of “twinning"".

&gt;  Things are not so black and white.

While I understand that, I think the overall data shows that education, especially at the graduate level consistently correlates with Pro-Choice views. While you don't need a good education to be intelligent, intelligence as a whole usually correlates with a high amount of education. While your personal experiences are relevant, they do not impact the data that I presented. You still have to deal with the choice that as a whole the pro-life movement is uneducated and highly religious compared to the pro-choice movement. Which shows that as a whole the Pro-Choice perspective correlates with higher education and intelligence.

&gt; This study is American.

I was under the impression we were focusing on the abortion debate in the U.S.

&gt; Well there is this and this.

Your first citation was from the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Which is a religious special interest group. Let's look at a few of their views:

&gt; Abortion is unsafe compared to the Child-Birth. 
http://www.aaplog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ab-safer__003.pdf

Even though the consensus in the medical community is that childbirth carries much more risk than abortion, AAPLOG continues to profess that the claim is under-researched, “a serious distortion of reality” and simply “pro-abortion speculation.” The official statement of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that “where abortion is legal, it is extremely safe.” Numerous research has debunked this issue: 
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/16/593447727/landmark-report-concludes-abortion-is-safe

&gt; Breast cancer and abortion could be linked and further studies are required.
http://www.aaplog.org/position-and-papers/breast-cancer/letter-to-incoming-acog-president-hammond/

And your organization just lost all its credibility when it decides to start citing claims that have been debunked [time](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/abortion-miscarriage-risk) and [time](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html) [again](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Induced-Abortion-and-Breast-Cancer-Risk)

As for your second link. That is not an actual published page by Princeton University, it is simply a website used by the school's student pro-life group. The University itself does not express those views.

So in summation, you gave me a debunked medical ""organization"" and student pro-life page. Not very credible if you ask me. ",1,1521316979,2018-03-17 16:02:59

356,"&gt; left to it's natural processes it WILL exceed those bench mark brain waves.

This is an argument from potentiality. This argument is from a potentiality standpoint and it has been refuted. There is no such thing as a “potential” life. When Jimmy Carter was six years old, he was a potential president of the United States, but even though the president of the United States has the right to command the armed forces, it does not follow that six-year-old Jimmy had even a very weak right to command the armed forces, let alone a right on a par with actual presidents. This example shows that potential rights do not entail actual rights, and that the assumption needed to ground the potentiality argument must be rejected. The potentiality argument akin to saying that a Home Depot is the same things as 100 houses because it holds that potential. How can a biological entity that has no nervous system be considered life? First, if a zygote should be protected because it can from a human being, why not also protect the sperm and eggs, for they can form a zygote which in turn can form a human being. The second, a major flaw, is that being potentially something isn’t the same as being something already. To see this, consider extrapolating the potential argument in the other direction: all human beings will die. And, seeing as a zygote will form a human being who will later form a corpse, it follows that we should treat both people and zygotes as if they were corpses. If we can give the right to life for an unborn baby, maybe we should give the right to a decent burial for a pre-dead corpse (i.e. a live baby). Not to mention that skin cells can replace sperm in forming a human being, so it follows that each skin cell destroyed is akin to destroying a human being. Unless, of course, having the potential to do something or be something isn’t equal to actually doing or being it. 

&gt;  to suggest even below those brain waves though that it's not a human is still preposterous, things that aren't human don't just turn into humans, we develop over time that's for sure, we may change in the way we look, but we were always human.

Please read what I said again. I never said the fetus wasn't human. I said wasn't a living individual human being. A fertilized egg, a clump of cells with no brain, is hardly deserving of the same moral status we confer on the newborn child or the functioning adult. Mere possession of the genetic material for a future human being does not make a human being. The developing embryo that becomes a fetus that becomes a baby is the product of a dynamic interaction with its environment in the womb, it's postnatal experiences, and a host of other factors. A purely genetic description of the human species does not describe a human being. A human being represents a whole other level of organization, as distinct from a simple embryo as an embryo is distinct from an egg and sperm. It is the dynamics between genes and environment that make a human being. Indeed, most of us are willing to grant this special status to a developing entity long before it is born, but surely not before the entity even has a brain

358,"A fetus can never scientifically be a parasite. A true parasite must be a different species than the host, and while I don't believe it to be a person, it is undeniable that it contains human DNA. A fetus *is,* however, parasitic in nature.

359,"&gt;First off the Author was a he.

Oh, how do you know? I didn't want to assume so I usually just stick with feminine pronouns.

&gt;That's some pretty credible ethos if you ask me.

I don't agree. Perhaps more credible than a regular person but not nearly as credible as an actual biologist or embryologist.
  
&gt; As an infertility specialist, I witness human fertilization in the laboratory every day. The human egg is a single living cell and it becomes a one-cell embryo if it successfully combines with a live sperm. No new life is formed — the egg and the sperm were already alive — and fertilization is not instantaneous.

I don't see how this demonstrates his point at all. Of course an egg and sperm are alive. The question is when a new and living human organism begins to exist. The human organism does not exist prior to fertilization. The human organism begins to exist at fertilization. The fact that the sperm and egg are alive does not negate this fact. Why would it?
 
&gt; The multicellular pre-implantation embryo cannot be equated with a human being. It is a collection of stem cells, each of which has the capacity to grow into any part of the placenta, as well as fetal tissues and organs, but it is not itself a new human life. It is also potentially more than one individual since identical twins are the result of a single implantation.

Now here he states an opinion but does not back it up. Why is it that it is not a living human organism? Because it can split? Because it can grow? He makes no sense. The definition of human organism does not necessitate that you can not split or grow. Sorry but I just don't see the point. Please feel free to elaborate. What am I missing here?
 
&gt; From a scientific perspective, life doesn't begin at any one point, it is a continuum.

Maybe life in general but we are talking about the life of a new human organism. That has a clear starting point and that is during fertilization.
 
&gt; So, the facts show that liberal, college educated, non-religious pro-lifers are very much the minority and the vast majority of the pro-life movement is made up conservative, lesser educated, religious folks.
 So, if the pro-life movement is based on ""basic biology"" that has nothing to do with religion, why are so few non-religious college graduates in the movement?

This study is American. It is ethnocentric. There is a whole world out there with differing views. I don’t view higher educated people as necessarily smarter. I have met many people who have much less formal education than me (and I hold 2 university degrees including Honours) that are just as intelligent or perhaps more. I think it is a silly assumption to equate intelligence with education. Things are not so black and white.

&gt; Better yet, if your movement is based on ""basic biology, why are there no major groups with names like ""biologists for life"" or ""pro-life embryologists""? Why do the majority of reputable medical organization in the world support a women's right to choose? Its okay to have different opinions, but not different facts.

Well there is [this](http://aaplog.org/) and [this](https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html). I don't agree that most medical organisations support abortion rights. In fact in much of the world doctors refuse to preform them. See[here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages). 70% of Italian doctors refuse to perform abortion. In fact, most of the rest of the world restricts abortion. In Europe it is illegal (with exception for life) after 12 weeks. In Ireland, Poland, Chile and other countries it is banned (with exception for life). The USA is only one of four countries that allows abortion after the 24th week. Pretty barbaric if you ask me.
 
&gt; At the end of the day, I am going to trust a trained OB/GYN from a reputable institution who is the president of one of the largest and most prestigious organizations involved in reproductive medicine, over redditor who couldn't be bothered over reading the article properly.

I read the article properly. I think your biased has blocked you from actually analyzing and understanding it. Obgyns are not biologist. They are medical doctors. These are very different things. I am not suggesting that my opinion is more important than the authors. He is obviously a more credible source than me. What I am suggesting is that you pick up a biology textbook or find a biological resource and see that they are not in agreement with the author of this article. See [here](http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_illustrated.php?page=6).

361,"Please read my response again. The whole idea of fetal wastage clearly shows that the whole ""Life beginning at conception"" dogma doesn't hold any water. I am not even referring to when abortions are performed, I am just offering a general structure of criticism in regards to your position. 

Here is what I mean in regards to Brain Activity:

As quoted by the JM Goldenring the original author of this idea: ""The brain enables our body, our mind, our personality. The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero until the occurrence of brain death. “At any point, human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4078859

Now at what point would we say the fetus has reached significant brain activity to be considered a human being so to say? Numerous Scientists have put it at around 28 to 32 week as this when the fetus develops significant brain function that differentiates us from animals.

http://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/09/archives/fetal-brain-said-to-live-at-28-weeks-role-of-the-brain-studies.html http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-19/local/me-476_1_brain-stem

So basically based on this idea we can see that the fetus reaches the brain birth criteria to become a human being at around 28 to 31 weeks. Now if we look at Abortion Data we will find that abortions happening beyond 21 weeks represent less than 1.3% of abortions. I would wager that abortions happening in the 28-31 week range are literally non-existent and the abortions that do happen this far are almost always of the case where the mother's life is in danger, or they are medically necessary. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6410a1.htm http://reason.com/blog/2016/10/21/late-term-abortions-in-america-2016

364,"I think it's the opposite. There are way too many problems with saying personhood begins at conception. The biggest empirical problem with the view that life begins at conception is that a large percentage of embryos lack the capacity, under any circumstances, to become human beings. During the period of embryonic development that begins with fertilization and ends a few days later with successful implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall—the period known as “preimplantation development”—up to 50 percent of human conceptions fail to survive, most likely due to genetic errors in the embryo. Many embryos that result from conception—indeed, the majority of them—lack the capacity to become living human beings. They do not produce disabled humans. They cannot produce any sort of human life. Science and medicine know this. A starting point that is far more consistent with the facts of biology is not conception but the emergence of the consistent and significant brain activity detected by an EGG.

I cannot consider a being to have entered personhood until they have reached the developmental point that they have the proper systems to think and feel pain.

That's some pretty credible ethos if you ask me.

&gt; If the author has given any scientific reasoning for why conception does not mark the beginning of a new and living human organism I surely did not see it.


From the Article:

As an infertility specialist, I witness human fertilization in the laboratory every day. The human egg is a single living cell and it becomes a one-cell embryo if it successfully combines with a live sperm. No new life is formed — the egg and the sperm were already alive — and fertilization is not instantaneous. 

The multicellular pre-implantation embryo cannot be equated with a human being. It is a collection of stem cells, each of which has the capacity to grow into any part of the placenta, as well as fetal tissues and organs, but it is not itself a new human life. It is also potentially more than one individual since identical twins are the result of a single implantation.

From a scientific perspective, life doesn't begin at any one point, it is a continuum.

&gt; but to try and deny basic biology is just ridiculous imo.

I want to break down something here. Let's just look at the demographics between those who are pro-life and those who identify as Pro-choice. 

According to Pew opposition to abortion (making it illegal in all or most cases) is the weakest among liberal Democrats at 8%, among the religiously nonaffiliated it is only 17% among college grads it is 29%.

Conversely, opposition to abortion (making it illegal in all or most cases) is the strongest among conservative Republicans at 71%. among white evangelicals it is 70%, among those with a high school education or less it is 53%.

http://www.pewforum.org/201...

So, the facts show that liberal, college educated, non-religious pro-lifers are very much the minority and the vast majority of the pro-life movement is made up conservative, lesser educated, religious folks.

So, if the pro-life movement is based on ""basic biology"" that has nothing to do with religion, why are so few non-religious college graduates in the movement?

Better yet, if your movement is based on ""basic biology is so strong why are there no groups with names like ""biologists for life"" or ""pro-life embryologists""? Why do the majority of reputable medical organization in the world support a women's right to choose?
Its okay to have different opinions, but not different facts.

396,"&gt; ""Killing is wrong, abortion is killing, Therefore abortion is wrong."" [...] This is the logic I apply to abortion

In logic, there is a distinction between *validity* and *soundness.* An argument is sound when it is valid and has true premises, but an argument can be unsound but valid insofar as its conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.

Your argument is valid, but **clearly unsound.** Obviously, not all killing is wrong. Killing millions of germs and bacteria, as your immune system does every second, is not wrong. Killing someone who non-consequentially intrudes into or uses your body (e.g., a rapist, a slavemaster, etc.) is not impermissible, but is not obligatory. 

(That's one reason why I'll (absurdly) grant full human personhood to the zygote and still maintain that abortion is wholly permissible: ignorance is not innocence, and if the fetus is (unknowingly) using your body against your will, then such a situation--or threat of one--is an offense to persons no less than rape or slavery. You have the right to remove a (oblivious sexomniac) rapist or your (equally oblivious) slaveholder from the use of your body, even if doing so would entail their deaths, right?)

But, if you object that ""by killing"" you mean ""killing persons (and bacteria are not persons)"" then you've back to begging the question concerning the very issue--personhood (and more fundamentally, *moral status*). And if by ""killing"" you mean ""killing persons,"" and if killing persons is *necessarily wrong* (as you seem to say), then all killing of persons--in self-defense or otherwise--is impermissible. 

That's a wildly implausable view. But, if that's what you're saying, then ***again***, if all killing is impermissible, and **murder = impermissible killing**, then you are, in fact begging the question in the manner said earlier: Murder is wrong, abortion is murder, :. abortion is wrong. Patently circular.

In philosophy, a computational theory of mind names a view that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1961, and developed by the MIT philosopher and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor (who was Putnam's PhD student) in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Despite being vigorously disputed in analytic philosophy in the 1990s (due to work by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others), the view is common in modern cognitive psychology and is presumed by many theorists of evolutionary psychology; in the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008).

The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computation that arises from the brain acting as a computing machine.

However, if we bring this discussion in that direction you'll need to PM me because I don't want to risk being banned (not that it's likely I would be, but I'd rather not take any chances, being as paranoid as I am).

My logic is not actually what you say it is. It actually goes more like ""Killing is wrong, abortion is killing, Therefore abortion is wrong."" Even if you kill your friend by accident that is wrong (even though you aren't responsible for his death and shouldn't need to pay for it), and it should be prevented if possible. This is the logic I apply to abortion; it is not the aborting I wish to stop so much as the death of the unborn. I would like very much to make steps to reduce miscarriage rates as well, but it's sort of difficult to get support for such things when the humanity of the unborn is under direct attack. As I see it, if the unborn are persons then they have a right to live, and so the most important thing to prove is that they are persons, or are not.

This lady is clearly not two persons, as she cannot split her separate DNA parts and have two functioning humans. Her two sets of DNA are fully dependent on each other and cannot be separated. If she could be split into two separate and complete living humans (like most Siamese twins can be, given the proper treatment) then I would consider her to be two separate persons. Both sets of DNA are her own, because they both belong to the same person who depends on and uses both of them. An embryo, on the other hand, uses only its own DNA and body to grow and develop, and uses its mother's body only to provide the food and shelter that any living thing needs. By this reasoning, it isn't a bodypart like this lady's ""other DNA"", it is a new individual and it needs to be in its mother to live. ",1,1521169897,2018-03-15 23:11:37

To beg the question is to assume the truth of the conclusion of an argument in the premises in order for the conclusion to follow. It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy, in which an arguer makes an argument that requires the desired conclusion to be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden or at least not easily apparent.

The term ""begging the question"", as it is usually phrased, originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin petitio principii, which actually translates to ""assuming the initial point"".

413,"I'm somewhat skeptical of the argument, since it seems to [beg the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) concerning the notion of ""life"" and ""living matter,"" since all ""living matter"" (whatever that is) is alive. ""Living"" and ""life"" are the very concepts in question here (at least for the person who would dispute the permissibility of abortion on the basis of considerations surrounding the very concepts of ""life"" and ""living."" This is hinted at in the seeming redundancy of ""biological life"" and ""living matter."" Again, it apparently begs the question concerning the very issue at hand.

In a way, the argument you presented makes a similar mistake in one very popular (*too* popular) argument against the moral permissibility of abortion:

Murder is wrong.
Abortion is murder.
Therefore, abortion is wrong. 

The argument is valid (x = y, a=x, :. y=a), but it clearly begs the question: ""*Murder""* is, by definition, *wrongful killing.* 

So the argument becomes:

Wrongful killing is wrong, 
abortion is wrongful killing, 
Therefore abortion is wrong. 

The very concept of *wrongness* is what is in question, so using ""wrong"" and ""murder"" separately (when ""wrong"" is a component concept of ""murder"") thus begs the question.

Also, I suspect there's an equivocation on the notion of ""independent."" I'm not sure about how having separate blood is relevant. Arguably, having separte DNA is a stronger criterion for the distinctness of persons, but even this seems irrelevant given that people who have chimerism can be their own twin sibling, with different DNA in their body, but nobody would say that someone like [Taylor Muhl](https://www.livescience.com/61890-what-is-chimerism-fused-twin.html)--who herself has **two sets of DNA, two immune systems, and two bloodstreams**--is ""two different people."" 

I mean, if having different bloodstreams is a sufficient condition for individuating persons (as you apparently claim), then people with chimerism are two-people-in-one; an absurd conclusion. ",1,1521163235,2018-03-15 21:20:35

415,"According to my understanding of my pro-life beliefs, it is when the embryo is able to develop into a fully developed human by itself without needing to take living matter from either of its parents that it can be considered a person.

It is an independent organism that grows and lives on its own, taking the air and food pumped into it by its mother. 

Biological life is obviously a continuous process so it alone cannot be used to determine one's personhood, otherwise each and every cell in your body would be a person. You need to be an independent human organism to be a person.

A fetus is not a baby. A baby is able to handle being a selarate unit. Therefore, your rant of “you can’t go around killing babies” doesn’t apply because a baby can be handed off to someone and a fetus is a literal drain on a woman’s body. Which you should look up what a parasite is.

Lamb doesn’t make his support of abortion a big part of his campaign.

Vaginal tightening and labial reduction has become trendy in California and, I believe, New York. It's a plastic surgery procedure, and far removed from ""restored virginity"" in intent. Or maybe not?

Abortions done by medically untrained people are definitely both illegal AND risky -- no argument there. But when I say ""medically untrained"" I don't mean the procedure should be done only by MDs IF it is illegal and otherwise difficult to obtain. In some states, far too many women attempt to self-abort rather than fill out the required paperwork, make multiple trips to clinics hundreds of miles away, and occasionally sit through lectures about ""killing their babies"". They need an affordable, easily accessible alternative -- these women are *desperate* and will do what they believe they have to do. I'm as against the coathangers as you are!!

Workhouses: From what I've read, often child deaths were due to disease such as pneumonia and dysentery (poor sanitation, malnutrition and starvation contributed to mortality rates, too).

Kids produced the least work so were fed the least, and illegitimate children were a major embarrassment to society at that time. Out of sight, out of mind. ",1,1516582773,2018-01-21 19:59:33

I am thinking of specific cultural comparisons -- I'm aware of modern-day ""virginity restoration"" primarily in a Saudi context (done by doctors), and I'm aware of introital tightening and/or infundibulation in an African context (done by people who you might call ""village wise women"").",1,1516577602,2018-01-21 18:33:22
11,"Safe? Nope. Wise? Well, if the alternative is a girl being flogged to death or sacrificed at the stake because her precious virginity is missing, then I'd choose the stitches and hope for the best. 

What IS it with virginity being the only quality a woman/girl is valued for? I guess it's a big deal when it makes the merchandise more sell-able, and nobody wanted to get stuck with a daughter who couldn't be auctioned off... sorry, married to the highest bidder. (""bidder"" meaning a potential husband with property or status that was valued by her father).

Same with abortion. ""Illegitimate"" children were considered a disgrace, and still are in many cultures -- including some here in the US. Until the mid-20th century, abortions were almost always the preferred alternative to adoption, especially when food was scarce. Nobody wanted another mouth to feed, and prior to the introduction of antibiotics, sending a child to a workhouse was a death sentence.

12,"&gt;  Can he force me to go through labor and have the baby anyways?

No.  And this is key.  Carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering has risks.  Only the person who will be subject to those risks gets to decide whether or not to undertake them.

&gt; This came up after my brother asked me why it’s a tragedy when a baby is still born but not when a fetus is aborted. I said it’s because nobody wants the fetus, and he proposed this scenario. I’m starting to think maybe he’s right

It's not always a tragedy when there's a stillbirth.  I have known stillbirths where the family was sad, sure, but also a little relieved.  Or a lot relieved.

I've also seen stillbirths where only the patient's partner was relieved, but the patient was sad.

It's almost as though how tragic an event is depends on whose perspective you're looking at it from.

Second-trimester abortions include the 18-20 week range, at which point it's well into the territory of a D&amp;E -- outside the range of the wisest of ""wise women"" (not that many of my attendings haven't been both wise and women).  Although abortions performed with modern techniques are incredibly safe, these techniques were developed since the 70s.

We don't have data on the techniques used thousands of years ago, just hints and suggestions that they may have included silphium and blunt trauma to the abdomen.  The suggestion that lay people trying to provide each other with abortions is safe and easy is a dangerous suggestion.

I am perfectly aware of the intent. 

&gt;Spreading misinformation does not help your side.

I wasn't spreading misinformation, it would be hard to read my comment and not think I was being openly willfully ignorant. But the fact is abortion is still killing a human and that is wrong. The point was that pro-choicers choose to deny the science, and deny the fact that a fetus is a life, calling an abortion 'safe' denies that categorical unarguable fact. 

&gt;And since you are anti abortion you better be pro adoption and pro fostering. Pro social programs, pro birth control etc.

Sure, I am. I'm adopted myself and use contraception. 'Social programs' is a bit vague though, that could mean anything. ",1,1516560542,2018-01-21 13:49:02
19,"Nah.

The reasons people have abortions are often numerous, but usually least among them is whether someone can do the childrearing for them, as adoption is always an option- particularly if you're carrying a healthy baby.

The thing is, most women don't want to carry a pregnancy to term only to give away their child at the end of it- they may fear growing too attached during the process and not wanting to relinquish them (or alternatively, feeling deep regret when forced to), worry about the person(s) doing the childrearing, or worry about guilt and regret over their limited (or non-existent) role in the child's life.  When women decide to abort despite possibly wanting children (or, if they already have them, more children) in the future, it's because they want to have a child for whom they have the time, finances, space, emotional well-being, stability, and supportive partner with whom they feel comfortable tying themselves for 18 years (and really, all their lives).

Whether a pregnancy not carried to term is seen as a tragedy really depends on the feelings of the people involved.  Because stillbirth usually happens far along in a pregnancy and that typically means someone was intending it to end in a live baby, it's often a tragedy . . . but an-early term miscarriage can be a tragedy for a woman who wanted to have a baby, or a relief for a woman struggling with the decision to abort or not and having it made for her.  A man whose partner decided to keep her pregnancy against his wishes may be secretly relieved at a stillbirth, and a man who wants his partner to keep her pregnancy may be devastated by her choice to abort.  A woman feeling pressured to terminate a pregnancy may come to view her abortion as a personal tragedy, even though it was ultimately her decision.  Honestly, there's no universal value judgment to be placed on any pregnancy outcome- they're all influenced by the situations wherein they arise.",1,1516560461,2018-01-21 13:47:41

35,"""I was simply just addressing some of the assertions you made in your comment."" You obviously went WELL beyond that.
""The title nor the article never said anything about MLK being pro-choice. Saying that would be intellectually dishonest. However, it is not intellectually dishonest to say that he supported Planned Parenthood and he supported their goals."" You posted in the pro-choice subreddit, so it's a reasonable assumption. It is also intellectually dishonest to say he would support Planned Parenthood today.
""It was hypothesized that, if abortion reflected a ""murderous"" violent act, then the cultures which permitted abortion should be similarly characterized; conversely, if abortion reflected a benevolent act, then the cultures which permitted abortion should also be characterized as benevolent and peaceful."" This is the definition of the false cause fallacy. There are plenty of correlations that don't mean causation. For example, gun control is positively correlated with standard of living, yet the US is an extreme exception to that rule. There is no reason to believe that if the US banned abortions it would also bring back slavery or outlaw premarital sex, etc., nor would allowing abortion in those harsh countries make the culture more humane. To suggest either or to suggest that those statistics characterize the western pro-life movement is nonsense.
""We can clearly see that the pro-life perspective is based on punishment and control, rather than actually saying lives."" Clearly? As someone who is pro-life, who knows many individuals who are pro-life, who knows what the pro-life movement is ACTUALLY about, I can assure you that we wouldn't give a damn about what a woman does with her body if it didn't involve the killing of another human being. That is ALL most of us care about: life. The biggest motivator behind the pro-life movement is Christianity, a religion rooted in self-sacrifice, grace, love, charity, humility, and I could go on. These values are in stark contrast to what you claim about us. Your straw man attacks aren't going to convince anyone.
""What we see in fact is that those who are pursuing higher education than just a bachelor degree tend to be overwhelmingly pro-choice."" 37% is still significant, but I don't care nearly as much about what most people think as I do about the arguments and facts themselves.
""Find me one non-religious or non-partisan based group that endorses a pro-life perspective."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anti-abortion_organizations_in_the_United_States#National_secular_organizations
Take your pick.
""And back to your earlier point about many doctors and scientists being pro-life. That is simply not true."" Many is subjective and there are many doctors, mostly Christian, that are Pro-life.
""Are you really going to try to argue that these vast organizations which represent the scientific consensus on this issue are wrong?"" Given that science doesn't care about morality or the value of human life, yes I say they are wrong. This is nothing like vaccines or evolution.

&gt;  I’ll even agree with you that its conjecture, but that’s kinda the point given that MLK never gave a statement on abortion (that i know of). He was all for contraception, however.

Once again look at the title of this post. The title nor the article never said anything about MLK being pro-choice. Saying that would be intellectually dishonest. However, it is not intellectually dishonest to say that he supported Planned Parenthood and he supported their goals. That was the point of this post. It was just to combat the myth's that pro-lifers put out that MLK would have been against Planned Parenthood. 

&gt; I am aware of the nation’s pro-choice trend. I am not phased by it. There are plenty of issues over the course of human history that were widely accepted, but wrong.

Sure I would agree with this too. But let us take a deeper look at the profile of what it means to be ""Pro-Life"". Studies have been done on this subject deeply. The question of whether abortion represents a ""murderous"" or a ""benevolent"" act is addressed in the 1975 article in The Humanist by examining the social-behavioral characteristics of primitive cultures that permitted or punished abortion. It was hypothesized that, if abortion reflected a ""murderous"" violent act, then the cultures which permitted abortion should be similarly characterized; conversely, if abortion reflected a benevolent act, then the cultures which permitted abortion should also be characterized as benevolent and peaceful. 

In brief, the following relationships were obtained from twenty-one primitive cultures where coded anthropological information was available on abortion and other behaviors:

55% of cultures that punish abortion practice slavery while 92% of cultures that permit abortion prohibit slavery.

73% of cultures that punish abortion also torture, mutilate and kill enemy captured in warfare while 80% of cultures that permit abortion do not torture, mutilate, and kill enemy captured in warfare.

78% of cultures that punish abortion punish premarital coitus while 

67% of cultures that permit abortion permit premarital coitus.

88% of cultures that punish abortion punish extramarital coitus while 67% of cultures that permit abortion permit extramarital coitus.

70% of cultures that punish abortion exploit children while 78% of cultures that permit abortion do not exploit children.

Now isn't that interesting? Anthropological studies show us that at a basic human level, being against abortion is also associated with other anti-humanistic behaviors. This isn't just something at the primitive. Studying has been done on the voting records of pro-life politicians of numerous countries. So if we wanna talk about history. We can clearly see that the pro-life perspective is based on punishment and control, rather than actually saying lives.

&gt; I am not entirely sure what your point is, though i can see how that statement is compelling. I would argue that this is purely correlational. Universities tend to be very liberal, so the educated are also surrounded and taught by pro-choicers. 

While I do acknowledge that Universities tend to be liberal, I encourage you to take a look at the article. Education in this sense also includes post-graduate education. What we see in fact is that those who are pursuing higher education than just a bachelor degree tend to be overwhelmingly pro-choice. And I would wager that the ethos of ""Liberal Indoctrination"" is much less at the Post Graduate level. 
http://news.gallup.com/poll/154946/non-christians-postgrads-highly-pro-choice.aspx

&gt; You definitely can’t say that increased education on this matter leads to people being pro-choice because there are many doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. that are pro-life.

I will address this point in a bit later. But like I said I have evidence from reputable organizations and reliable data that clearly show a trend back by peer-reviewed data. 

&gt; That’s an obvious stretch. I will grant you that most scientific/medical organizations are pro-choice.

It's not a stretch. If you think it is a strech, find me one non-religious or non-partisan based group that endorses a pro-life perspective. And back to your earlier point about many doctors and scientists being pro-life. That is simply not true. The majority of these scientific organizations represent hundreds of thousands of Doctors. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which represents 55,000 doctors who literally specialize in fetal development has argued and fought against many pieces of unsound scientific legislation. Are you really going to try to argue that these vast organizations which represent the scientific consensus on this issue are wrong? With all due respect, it is like trying to argue against Vaccines or Evolution. 

&gt; So please, focus on what i said that was directly related to the original post

And I did. MLK supported Planned Parenthood and there is evidence for that. His views towards abortion are mostly conjecture, and I never made a statement towards his views on abortion and if I did I apologize.

63,"I know I'm late, but this really bothered me. 

&gt;First of all, a woman isn't forcing a man to be a father. He made that choice when he had sex.

I really disagree with this. How is saying he made the choice to be a father when he decided to have  sex, any different from saying that a woman decided to be a mother when she has sex and now MUST have the baby. No they didn't decide to be parents! They had an unfortunate accident. Especially if they took all necessary precautions against pregnancy. 

Of course, I hold that only the pregnant woman has the right to end an unwanted pregnancy, regardless of the feelings of the father (or anyone else on the subject) on the subject. 

Women have physical stakes in a pregnancy and can potentially have social and financial stakes as well, if they decide to go through with it AND keep the baby. Men have the same potential social and financial stakes. 

We shouldn't downplay social and financial burdens of an unwanted child any less than the physical burdens of an unwanted pregnancy!

Just like women have the right to a physical abortion (and of course social and financial opt-outs later if they birth the child and give it away), men should have the same social and financial opt-outs. 

Ideally, just like abortions should be carried out as soon as possible, after discovering an unwanted pregnancy, these social and financial opt-outs for men should also be available within a certain time frame at the beginning of the pregnancy.   

Then if the pregnant woman wants a child, she can go into the having the child, knowing fully well that she will have no social or financial support from the father. If she has no means to support the child and still chooses to bring that potential life into the world, that's entirely on her morally.

Women aren't entitled to children any more than men are! And people should really only have children when they're ready on all fronts; physical, emotional and financial, and not bring any more misery into the world. If they, they're entirely responsible for that misery.

I was curious and wanted to see what they had to say.  At one point, we had to role-play what we would say if counseling a woman (or was it arguing with a pro-choicer?) about a pregnancy that had been affected by [thalidomide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#Birth_defects_crisis).  I gave my little spiel from the pro-choice perspective to a very nice older lady who was my partner, and she was like ""Wow, you're really good at this!"" and I'm sure I had to suppress a laugh because . . . yeah.

&gt; Really? Because from my perspective, you haven't really outlined how you think of things/your perspective. It's been mostly questions. 

Yeah, by bringing up the identity/thought side of things I was trying to flip it.  But I think things probably won't work out that symmetrically.

---

&gt; I think what qualifies as a ""core identity"" is not necessarily going to be agreed on by everyone -- it may be a spectrum issue. However, even acknowledging that this can be a spectrum, there are clearly things that fall harder on one side vs the other. It seems like drastically changing your entire DNA composition should, if anything, qualify. If not that, then what?

First, I think that lots of people are going to agree on different things about ""core identity.""  For example, a lot of people might agree that a ""fundamental"" or ""core identity"" change would be whether one has a male or female phenotype.  That's something that can be as simple as inactivating the Sry region on the Y chromosome.  On the other hand, I could completely replace massive non-coding regions of your genotype and your phenotype would have basically no change.

However, I think that the benchmark that you set of ""agreed on by everyone"" is an odd one -- I think we're going to run more into psychology and what is and is not understood in popular science.  I'm interested in the underlying reality, and in the underlying reality, ""core identity"" isn't a thing.  That's an emotional human assignment, driven by our (very functional and useful!) desire to think of large groups of atoms as single things organized by function.

---

&gt; Meanwhile, as I mentioned, scientists also seemed to agree this was a fundamental change which is why they chose to drastically differentiate an ovum and zygote as a gamete and organism.

That's an overreach, I think, and it's the kind of weird appeal to authority that keeps frustrating me.  It's a change.  There are reasons that it's useful to differentiate an ovum and a zygote, gametes and organisms.  There are also reasons that it's useful to differentiate a primary oocyte and a secondary oocyte.  There isn't a scientific consensus on what are ""fundamental changes"" and what are ""non-fundamental changes,"" and your insinuation that there are is what I find nebulous in your argument.

---

&gt; Like I get the general speciation issue, but I believe what I said is still accurate for sexually reproducing populations. 

Yes, species are defined the way that you said, but then that definition and observations in nature don't always line up, for example, in ring species.  (Assuming you want ""same species"" to be a transitive property.)

What is alive and what is an organism are not the same question. I think you could absolutely have a situation in which you're not sure if something is ""alive,"" but if it were it would easily qualify as an organism (or not). One conundrum doesn't necessarily follow the other.

The species problem is the set of questions that arises when biologists attempt to define what a species is. Such a definition is called a species concept; there are at least 26 recognized species concepts. A species concept that works well for sexually reproducing organisms such as birds is useless for species that reproduce asexually, such as bacteria. The scientific study of the species problem has been called microtaxonomy.

Yeah.  These are good counterexamples.  I got a weird kind of focus on borders as transitions between two things in a way that made my question come out stupid and open to such obvious counterexamples.  My bad.

&gt; these are all either Y/N or otherwise very clearly specified criteria.

89,"&gt;Consider the zygote in a petri dish. Is it capable of homeostasis, growth, development, reproduction, and more? No it is not, no more than an adult human in hard vacuum is. It would require dramatic intervention and rescue to evidence those capabilities.

Right, but the definition isn't referring to ""even without resources."" It's referring to: if given the resources. Otherwise *none* of us would be considered organisms. What matters is our capabilities given these extrinsic resources. Not how quickly we'd die without them. Meanwhile an ovum, if given the same resources, would not be capable of these feats. 

&gt;Consider the egg making its way down a fallopian tube. Is it capable of those things? Sure, so long as it encounters some sperm.

In other words, it's *not intrinsically* capable of any of those things. Again, this is the difference between abilities innate to the entity and abilities that require a fundamental change in an intrinsic quality like chromosome number, which is a fundamental change in that entity's identity -- which is precisely why scientists felt it was appropriate to call one an organism and one a gamete. Meanwhile an actual organism *is* intrinsically capable of all those things, with the only variable being extrinsic nutritional resources.  

&gt;Because I feel sure that it will involve more things like distinction between ""intrinsic"" and ""extrinsic"" deficiencies that will just be like more no-true-Scotsman rationales to my ears and we'll keep on getting frustrated with each other. 

Well you are correct. I obviously don't see it as a no-true-Scotsman. I think the difference between an intrinsic quality and extrinsic resources are *very* morally relevant (again, else we'd all be value-less, which I doubt even you ascribe to). But if you don't agree, then you don't agree. That's fine.

&gt;Or maybe you'd say something like ""well, if it's in its natural environment."" Ugh! More ascription of intent to the universe.

Ok I have never once mentioned ""natural"" anything. I don't ascribe to naturalistic fallacies. 

&gt;What's something you see as a hard border in biology?

Well for example if two organisms can't reproduce with each other (given normal functioning) then they are no longer considered the same species. 

Other examples: Whether someone has certain SNPs in their genotype (which may convey risk of certain disease). Whether a cell has NMDA receptors or not, or is CD4, CD8, etc positive. Whether a medication is metabolized by CYP450 or not. Laceration degrees in the perineum. Gastroschisis vs omphalocele. I mean there are probably *a lot*, these are all either Y/N or otherwise very clearly specified criteria. 

&gt;Im genuinely surprised by your whole response to this. If you'd asked, I would have been sure that you had a more... Kantian/absolutist approach. A more of a ""well, you can think what you want... but you'll be wrong"" response.

I think we'd agree on more than you seem to think.

&gt;I think that my identity would change if I lost, e.g., a leg. I think there's a way that our bodies and minds affect each other; after all the body is the mind's hardware.

Right. I just have a personal identity with, say, my arm. I'm sure I could (I know I could) develop a changed identity with a different kind of arm. Obviously identity is a cognitive function so could not exist without some kind of brain.

90,"&gt; I agree that's true, but point out the current definition of an organism chose a time point in which the entity referred to qualifies as a living being capable of homeostasis, growth, development, reproduction, and more -- from that point on and not from a single point beforehand -- in other words, the current definition relays real qualities about the entity in question that apply from then onward, and qualities are things I can and do find valuable. It's really not about re-referencing the term organism. It's about the qualities that word conveys.

The zygote is as capable of those things alone as an unfertilized egg is capable of those things alone.  The zygote needs an endometrial lining to accomplish those things, just as the unfertilized egg needs a sperm.  The current definition does not relay real qualities.

Consider the zygote in a petri dish.  Is it capable of homeostasis, growth, development, reproduction, and more?  No it is not, no more than an adult human in hard vacuum is.  It would require dramatic intervention and rescue to evidence those capabilities.

Consider the egg making its way down a fallopian tube.  Is it capable of those things?  Sure, so long as it encounters some sperm.

In fact, each of those qualities is very environment-dependent.

If you think that the qualities relayed by the definition of ""organism"" have ethical significance, show how those qualities have ethical significance, and how they apply to zygotes and not to eggs and not to moles.

I'm genuinely surprised by your whole response to this.  If you'd asked, I would have been sure that you had a more... Kantian/absolutist approach.  A more of a ""well, you can think what you want... but you'll be wrong"" response.

In any case, I do know that embryos do not think of themselves at all.

&gt; I think part of my most present identity would be lost if I lost parts of my body, but that I would just change/compensate. 

This is interesting to me.

I think that my identity would *change* if I lost, e.g., a leg.  I think there's a way that our bodies and minds affect each other; after all the body is the mind's hardware.

Some of this is a little bit of a language deficiency.  I would still identify myself as the brainwaves.  I wouldn't consider any part of my true self to be lost.  I also use the word ""me"" to refer to my body.  It's not like I'd get hit and say ""hey!  You hit the flesh I animate!""  Like other human beings, I say, ""hey, you hit me!""

When you drive something, you identify with it.  It's part of why people care so much about their cars.",1,1515808297,2018-01-12 20:51:37
91,"&gt;It really feels to me like ""intrinsic lacking"" and ""extrinsic lacking"" are getting picked in order to produce your goals of what you want to be and not be an organism, and not due to some logical internal law.

If that's what you think, ok. That is how I see it, and I think it's completely relevant to determine what isn't an organism *at all* vs what is an organism that doesn't get the food/nutrition/oxygen/vitamins/whatever needed to continue living as an organism. Kind of the difference between death and not existing in the first place. I find that pretty relevant.

&gt;One of them (B) is a mole -- your Infinity Microscope has shown you the methylation pattern. Can you throw it out, or would that be murder?

If by murder you mean ""killing a living organism""/more immoral than killing an egg, sperm, or tumor -- then no. That would not be more immoral. 

&gt;If you had a medication that you could drip over B while thawing it out, that would reverse its methylation pattern... could you choose not to apply that medication and just throw it out?

Again the difference between not existing as a living human organism vs. existing and being killed or existing and being denied nutrition. So yeah, it's as valuable as a tumor. To me this is like asking ""is it ok to kill my skin cells?"" Yes. Yes it is. Those are not human beings. They *can* be *made* into human beings theoretically if we had the ability to clone humans -- does that make killing skin cells somehow morally bad? No. Because we aren't under some moral obligation to *make more human beings*. We are, imo, under a moral obligation to *not kill* existing human beings.

&gt;A it turns out isn't normal. It has a mitochondrial disease and all of its mitochondria will die half an hour (an hour? six months? six years?) after thawing. You can do a mitochondrial transplant and save it. Surely not doing so would be negligent, right?

Yeah I think that would be negligent just as refusing standard of care to born patients would be negligent. However I think this gets more into equity and cost of healthcare than anything else. 

&gt;What I genuinely don't understand is how a change in the methylation pattern of genes can switch something from person to non-person.

I'll continue to refer you to the link.

&gt;Yeah, because I'm not making the statement ""all things that think are people.""

It's not about whether you made the statement or not. It's about whether you can recognize that in such an example, the gray area wouldn't negate the black/white ones. 

&gt;Why, though?

I assume you mean ""how"" (""Why"" implying some sort of overarching purpose/meaning that I can't necessarily speak to) 

&gt;And, just a reminder, if you say ""because that's when an organism starts"" or ""before that the sperm and egg were parts of different organisms"" or some other self-referential thing like that, this whole semantic cycle will restart.

Ok so you bring up all these other landmarks in development and point out we could have arbitrarily called those points ""organisms."" I agree that's true, but point out the *current* definition of an organism chose a time point in which the entity referred to qualifies as a living being capable of homeostasis, growth, development, reproduction, and more -- from that point on and not from a single point beforehand -- in other words, the current definition relays real *qualities* about the entity in question that apply from then onward, and *qualities* are things I can and do find valuable. It's really not about re-referencing the term organism. It's about the qualities that word conveys.

And now you're just basically repeating your question of ""but how can you say you started as a zygote"" and telling *me not to repeat myself*. I'm sorry but I already answered this question, and if you ask it again, I will answer it the same thing again. Unless I'm just not understanding your new question. 

&gt;Drawing clear borders between one thing and another thing, or one thing and two things, isn't the business of biology.

Biology does this all the time. There are plenty of gray areas but there are also plenty of borders. 

&gt; Your body has a sort of physical continuity with a fetus and an embryo, I agree... 

It's not just about physical continuity. It's about quality and intrinsic ability continuity. 


&gt;If you cut off my arm, there won't be any less of me, except insofar as ""me"" gets used to refer to the flesh I animate. How does this way of thinking of it seem to you?

Well first of all I think that's up to the individual to think of themselves how they wish. I'm not going to tell you how you should envision ""you"" as an identity. 

However without knowing how each individual envisions who they are, to me it's better to err on the side of caution and not cut a life short without first knowing how that individual sees themselves. Just like it's not ok to start randomly murdering people simply because we know *some people* are suicidal/couldn't care less if they died. 

For me personally, I see myself as both brain and ""other body"" parts. I think part of my most present identity would be lost if I lost parts of my body, but that I would just change/compensate.

92,"&gt; I think there's a big difference between not having the necessary genes -- which occurs at the very beginning of when an organism would exist -- and not having the right nutritional components to develop what would otherwise develop without an issue. It's the difference between an intrinsic and extrinsic lacking. 

It really feels to me like ""intrinsic lacking"" and ""extrinsic lacking"" are getting picked in order to produce your goals of what you want to be and not be an organism, and not due to some logical internal law.

Let's say that you have two zygotes, both frozen, left over from prior IVF cycles.  One of them (A) is normal.  Throwing it out would be murder, you should instead find a couple with infertility willing to use it as a donor embryo.  One of them (B) is a mole -- your Infinity Microscope has shown you the methylation pattern.  Can you throw it out, or would that be murder?

If you had a medication that you could drip over B while thawing it out, that would reverse its methylation pattern... could you choose not to apply that medication and just throw it out?

Okay, now let's look at A.  A it turns out isn't normal.  It has a mitochondrial disease and all of its mitochondria will die half an hour (an hour? six months? six years?) after thawing.  You can do a mitochondrial transplant and save it.  Surely not doing so would be negligent, right?

What I genuinely don't understand is how a change in the methylation pattern of genes can switch something from person to non-person.  A mole does, in fact, have all the necessary genes -- just the methylation patterns (which guide which genes get red) are set to the wrong combination.

Heck, embryo C has no mitochondria (aka B, but negative one seconds instead of half an hour).  Is it an organism/person?

---

&gt; I mean it kind of sounds like you agree that the gray area doesn't negate the clear ones?

Yeah, because I'm not making the statement ""all things that think are people.""

---

&gt; the zygote is the same human entity as the grown adult,

&gt; I wasn't a sperm. I wasn't an egg.

Why, though?

And, just a reminder, if you say ""because that's when an organism starts"" or ""before that the sperm and egg were parts of different organisms"" or some other self-referential thing like that, this whole semantic cycle will restart.

*Co-entityness* isn't a biological concept.  Drawing clear borders between one thing and another thing, or one thing and two things, isn't the business of biology.  Your body has a sort of physical continuity with a fetus and an embryo, I agree... but it also has that physical continuity with the egg, or with the sperm.  Both of those needed to get stuff added to them to make it to being a newborn, but so did the embryo.

By the way, the way I think of it: ""I"" am none of those things.  I'm not even this grown adult body that I'm in.  I'm a pattern of brainwaves.  If you cut off my arm, there won't be any less of me, except insofar as ""me"" gets used to refer to the flesh I animate.  How does this way of thinking of it seem to you?",1,1515798922,2018-01-12 18:15:22
93,"&gt;what if I could change gene methylation and turn a [insert word here for a zygote but for a molar pregnancy] into a normally-dividing cell?

Then it...would..be...an organism? Sorry, maybe I'm not understanding the significance of the question.

&gt; Is ""folic acid"" one of the things that is required for development into an organismal level of organization? Does it fall under ""molecules, genes, etc.""?

I think there's a big difference between not having the necessary genes -- which occurs at the very beginning of when an organism would exist -- and not having the right nutritional components to develop what would otherwise develop without an issue. It's the difference between an intrinsic and extrinsic lacking. 

&gt;So you could go ahead and give me those situations, and I'd be like, ""yeah, okay.""

I mean it kind of sounds like you agree that the gray area doesn't negate the clear ones?

&gt;So to me it sounds like ""Human organisms, as some people decided to call them,...""

Yeah, I think that's accurate. It's an observation. Observed qualities or phenomena, given a name: organism. Like, this particular entity (a human organism) is fundamentally present even as a zygote, after two gametes combine. They pinpointed stages in the human life cycle.  

&gt;Instead, I think it would be better to say, ""planets are defined as clearing their orbit of asteroids. I think that we should only send people to bodies that have cleared their orbits of asteroids, because of this specific reason that relates those two fragments somehow.""

Understandable. And I agree. It's not the word itself that matters; it's what quality the word is capturing.

&gt;All of these would, I swear, be workable ways of calling things organisms.

Right. And the current one makes most sense to me in terms of what it's describing/why it matters in a moral sense. The others wouldn't.

And I feel like I've said this multiple times, but the zygote *is* the same human entity as the grown adult, but at a different phase of development. Like *I* was a zygote. You were a zygote. Certainly I'd hope you can see how this is the case for embryos. Biologically, as an embryo, I was developing my eyes, ears, heart... I wasn't a sperm. I wasn't an egg. And I didn't only begin developing at implantation/etc -- those are *stages* of development, not the start of it. And I speak in terms of myself but this is true for all humans. An individual human begins as a zygote. 

&gt;Disclaimer: there are reasons that we picked fertilization to say ""organism""! I know that. I just don't think that those reasons have ethical significance.

Ok that's fine. I have yet to hear another time point that, to me, makes more consistent and understandable (moral/rational) sense though.

94,"I mean, any normal pregnancy will end in . . . a child, that you either have to provide for over the course of 18 years, or that you will have to relinquish to others to do so.  It can be a negative thing or a positive thing, but suffice to say, the word ""elective"" towards either procedure (abortion or continued gestation and labor and delivery) really undercuts the weight of what either outcome means for the life of that person.

96,"&gt; No, I meant to imply it's not an organism.

Cool, then I'll go with option B: what if I could change gene methylation and turn a [insert word here for a zygote but for a molar pregnancy] into a normally-dividing cell?

&gt; If the necessary structures (molecules, genes etc.) required for development (i.e., an organismal level of organization) do not exist in an entity from the beginning, the entity is intrinsically incapable of being an organism and is therefore not a human being. 

This sort of... no-true-Scotsmanish stuff is what I find so weird.  Is ""folic acid"" one of the things that is required for development into an organismal level of organization?  Does it fall under ""molecules, genes, etc.""?  Because it's definitely required for development and it definitely doesn't exist in the entity (zygote) from the beginning.  A zygote absolutely does not have ""the necessary structures (molecules, genes, etc.) required for development""!  What is an organismal level of organization?  How is this definition not circular?

&gt; Then I (as the evil opponent) get to delve into situations where sentience is possibly middle-ground gray-area questionable (or are we just too stupid to understand it?).

Actually, my morals don't have that opening, because I don't think that personhood necessarily has clear borders.  I'm A-OK with there being situations where it's unclear if an entity is a person or not.  (For example, the evolution question I asked you earlier.  I don't know what my answer to that would be!  I'm not OK with killing great apes.  Heck, I'm not sure if I should be OK with pork.)  So you could go ahead and give me those situations, and I'd be like, ""yeah, okay.""

&gt; Human organisms, as defined scientifically, have particular abilities in their lifetime -- which I can and do attach value to. Your simplistic definition ignored that. And your exceptional examples don't negate or obfuscate it. I really think that's the crux of this discussion.

It's this ""defined scientifically"" that keeps on rubbing me the wrong way.  It makes it sound like scientists discovered that fertilization was the start of life.  There's no experiment demonstrating that.  Some people decided to call it that.  So to me it sounds like ""Human organisms, as some people decided to call them,...""

It's like saying, ""we shouldn't send people to Pluto, because it's not a planet.""  We could easily redefine ""planet"" to include Pluto.  Instead, I think it would be better to say, ""planets are defined as clearing their orbit of asteroids.  I think that we should only send people to bodies that have cleared their orbits of asteroids, because of this specific reason that relates those two fragments somehow.""

Pretend for a moment that there are a dozen different words.

Organism1: as soon as an oocyte is formed, it is an organism.  Eventually it gets fertilized, gets some more genetic material, and divides into a big multicellular being.

Organism2: as soon as a spermatocyte is formed, it is an organism.  Eventually it dives into an egg, gets some more genetic material, and divides into a big multicellular being.

Organism3: at fertilization.

Organism4: at first mitosis.

Organism5: at implantation.

Organism6: at gastrulation

Organism7: at birth.

All of these would, I swear, be workable ways of calling things organisms.  It wouldn't make biology fall apart if we had defined the word ""organism"" to be one of these things instead.

Why would you pick organism3 to be more ethically significant than organism2 or organism4?

---

Another way I could phrase it is, pretend that you and I are the only scientists, discovering all of the details of biology.  There are no words for this stuff yet, no definitions.  We've discovered these nifty sperm and eggs, and they're alive and human, and they combine, and the zygote is also alive and human, and the zygote divides and implants and gastrulates and neurulates and grows.

We don't have words for any of it yet.  Nobody has defined any of it as being the start of an organism because we didn't know how it works.

Now, imagining that moment, before the word organism was made -- why is fertilization ethically significant?

---

Disclaimer: there are reasons that we picked fertilization to say ""organism""!  I know that.  I just don't think that those reasons have ethical significance.",1,1515741051,2018-01-12 02:10:51
97,"&gt;you mean to say that it is definitely an organism, which would imply that you think a molar pregnancy is an organism.

No, I meant to imply it's *not* an organism. I apologize for being unclear. The blog post I linked outlines that. But I should have stated it as well.

&gt;In the ""destroying any human organism is murder"" worldview, is this murder? Well, if fertilization is defined as being complete with meiosis II, then it's not destroying a new organism.

Right.

&gt;Another medication I made specifically blocks the first cell division (don't ask me how I targeted it), instead triggering apoptosis. Now this one is murder.

It is destroying a new organism (interesting how you switched from ""not destroying a new organism"" to ""murder""?). Let's just stick with the facts for now: it *is* destroying an organism.

You have correctly pinpointed when an organism comes into existence.

&gt;So my question has been, what is ethically significant about any of these transitions?

I feel like I've repeatedly made a case (*particularly* in my first comment) for why I believe all human organisms, regardless of age, have great value. I believe it is the most consistent ethical position to have, and all other pro-choice positions I've seen have pretty gaping holes that, to me, would make them indefensible. However I can't force you to agree with my moral perspective on human organisms. 

&gt;That moral framework involves a theory of personhood that's based on thought and consciousness, and I think that it's generally internally consistent and defensible.

I wrote the above before reading this which I just find amusing :P

&gt; I think it's not internally consistent and that it relies on replacing reality with overly simplified definitions

Kind of an interesting point because on the one hand, your argument *seems* to have been:

* give a super simplistic definition of ""organism"" to imply that attaching any value to such an entity is senseless (i.e. saying that an organism is just a fertilized ovum)
* then produce multiple rare/nuanced situations to imply that what an organism is either can't be known or if there is a situation where it's unclear, say, how *many* organisms exist, then that somehow means all other situations where the definition is easily applied are meaningless.

Obviously, I disagree. And I think this speaks to morality in general. Almost all our moral stances have to utilize facts first and foremost. So for example if you find ""sentience"" to be the crux of moral value, then you have to produce some valid definition of sentience. Then I (as the evil opponent) get to delve into situations where sentience is *possibly* middle-ground gray-area questionable (or are we just too stupid to understand it?). Yet I'm sure you'd agree it wouldn't negate situations where sentience clearly exists, and the moral value you attach to sentience would still apply in those situations.  

Human organisms, as defined scientifically, have particular abilities in their lifetime -- which I can and do attach value to. Your simplistic definition ignored that. And your exceptional examples don't negate or obfuscate it. I really think that's the crux of this discussion. 

&gt;That's why we haven't discussed the 9-14 week terminations.

I'm not complaining about that. My issues is that *no* abortions occur at one-second past fertilization, so no matter whose moral framework we're discussing, the issue is tangential to the abortion debate. 

Not that I mind discussing it.

&gt;I thought you said I was the one trying to make things more complicated, but now you're telling me that it seems that I've found it more complicated than I thought it was...?

Lol. Not both, but two distinct possibilities. And I'm speculating. Could be totally off.

&gt; Perhaps you have been misled by my perpetual internal state of wide-eyed wonder at the underlying mechanics of the world? 

I guess so!

I don't doubt your credentials at all. But I don't think being a skilled ob/gyn necessarily even means such a person understands the definition of ""organism"" -- because it's not pertinent to their work.  

By the way, how *does* an ob/gyn find time to engage in essay-length discussions on reddit??

&gt; No, it's not ""probably an organism."" This is covered in the link I keep referencing. 

Well, the description that I gave (""an egg and a sperm combine and a little while later there are two sets of DNA"") happens also to describe the start of a lot of molar pregnancies.  It sounds like, by countering ""No, it's not ""probably an organism."""" you mean to say that it is definitely an organism, which would imply that you think a molar pregnancy is an organism.

This is part of what I mean when I say that your version seems more complicated to me.  Although we may have short words for them (""zygote,"" ""organism""), the underlying reality of those words is not clear-cut.  Take a fertilized egg and an Infinity Microscope (an instrument that lets you have complete knowledge of the current physical state of a thing).  If I showed you a fertilized egg and asked you, ""is this a person?"" and you said, ""no, because the methylation pattern of the DNA shows that it will ultimately become a molar pregnancy and not a viable fetus,"" I'd think... ""wow, this person's morality is full of arbitrary choices.""

And to me, that's what you're saying when you say, ""no, because it's not a human organism.""

---

&gt; Just as a side point: I think this is a great example of the Continuum fallacy. There existing a delta of time and innumerable transition points when zoomed in enough do not at all negate the distinct pre and post-state. And while this may simply be about how we define a human organism (worthy convo), no abortion is killing any entity in the pre-zygote stage.

&gt; Regardless, a zygote exists when the chromosomes combine and the cell finishes meiosis. 

**Please continue this thread.**

This is a great distinction.  Let's say that I found a medication that I was using as an emergency contraceptive.  Its mechanism of action was that it specifically blocked meiosis II -- it made meiosis II trigger apoptosis instead.  So egg and sperm would combine, but they would never finish meiosis II.

In the ""destroying any human organism is murder"" worldview, is this murder?  Well, if fertilization is defined as being complete with meiosis II, then it's not destroying a new organism.

Another medication I made specifically blocks the first cell division (don't ask me how I targeted it), instead triggering apoptosis.  Now this one is murder.

If I redefine an organism as starting once the sperm and egg fuse phospholipid bilayers, both are murder.  If I redefine an organism as starting after the first cell division, neither is murder.  All of these are reasonable definitions for organism.  So my question has been, what is ethically significant about any of these transitions?

---

&gt; Not only are a lot of these cases more straightforward (imo) than you are portraying them, but also the existence of confusing situations doesn't negate the more clear-cut situation of what the vast, vast majority of abortions kill. 

(And a response to the situation in general.)

We have two separate points here.

One is that my moral framework that allows me to perform abortions, which I recognize not everybody is comfortable doing.  That moral framework involves a theory of personhood that's based on thought and consciousness, and I think that it's generally internally consistent and defensible.

Your moral framework prohibits you from tolerating abortions, and it involves a theory of personhood that's based on biological identities.  I think it's not internally consistent and that it relies on replacing reality with overly simplified definitions; if I seem to make it more complicated, that's because I believe the reality is more complicated.

We've been discussing your moral framework, not mine, and what's been happening for a little while is that I've been trying to show you why your moral framework could never sit right with me.  I'll defend late-term abortions, and you'll denounce them at one second past fertilization, and most of them will happen at 9-14 weeks.  If we're discussing my framework, I bet you'd bring up late-term abortions.  If we're discussing your framework, I'll talk about right after fertilization.  That's why we haven't discussed the 9-14 week terminations.

&gt;  it seems like you came across all this information, found it to contain way more nuance/depth than your previous knowledge of reproduction, and concluded either that the term organism is somewhat meaningless or that we can't really know what is or isn't an organism.

Things I've learned in this (and similar) discussions that I didn't know before:

* There is legitimate difference of opinion on whether conjoined twins constitute one organism or two.  (Learned that in this discussion.)

I think it's clear-cut that they're one organism and two people, and there are a couple of people saying the same things in scientific publications that I could search online.  But other sources say ""it's two organisms that fused"" (nevermind that, historically, it's more like one organism that half-split).

That's because biology has no interest in making our lives easy by producing clear borders.  There's no test for organism-ness, because ""organism"" is a label that we've applied.

* The synthetic/analytic distinction.  (Learned that in a previous one.)

Anyway, no.  I knew about (example at random) the acrosomal reaction in high school.

100,"&gt;Could you give me an example of a case in which the fetus is known to have vanishingly small chances at survival following birth, but you would not support allowing a termination of the pregnancy?

I think this depends what you mean by ""vanishingly small."" Also many conditions that might otherwise be lethal can be fixed pretty well with surgery. I'm sorry, really not trying to avoid the question, but most things that come to mind (and I'm sure I'm not thinking of 90% of existing birth defects) are either fixable, the patient is already dead, or the patient would suffer an agonizing death without a surgeon &amp; typically a surgeon is needed for a later-term abortion anyway. Perhaps you could throw a scenario out there you think might fit?

&gt;For example, almost everything in medicine. What's high blood pressure? It just got redefined to include anything above 130 systolic.

Right, I get what you're saying. Scientific terms can be arbitrarily chosen but they still (usually) have precise definitions. The latter part is what I meant by ""relay real phenomena."" Although it's also true that some terms refer to less arbitrary cut-offs than others. Hypertension can be pretty arbitrary whereas what defines a proton donor is more concrete. Not all scientific terms are as arbitrary as hypertension. 

&gt;Fertilization is when an egg and sperm combine. When exactly? The acrosomal reaction of the sperm with the egg? 

Just as a side point: I think this is a great example of the [Continuum fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy) There existing a delta of time and innumerable transition points when zoomed in enough do not at all negate the distinct pre and post-state. And while this may simply be about how we define a human organism (worthy convo), no abortion is killing any entity in the pre-zygote stage. 

Regardless, a [zygote exists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9901/) when the chromosomes combine and the cell finishes meiosis. 

&gt;Following completion of oocyte meiosis, the fertilized egg (now called a zygote) contains two haploid nuclei (called pronuclei), one derived from each parent.

The relevant information is specified. And certainly if you're looking at what constitutes a human organism, abortions pro-lifers object to absolutely kill one.

Like you, I'm not meaning to be rude by skipping a lot of what you said, but frankly it seems like you're getting hung up on fertilization (which by the way doesn't have to be an instant; it can and is a well-defined process with an end point) when that's really just a landmark of the creation of a zygote, or a human organism. I understand not all living species operate like ours. I don't see how that's relevant. We do clearly understand the landmarks in the human life cycle and what constitutes an organism and the qualities organisms carry over their individual lifetime (maintains homeostasis, reproduces, grows, develops, etc). 

&gt;There are a couple of purposes it really doesn't work well for. An egg and a sperm combine and a little while later there are two sets of DNA. Probably an organism, right? Well, it turns out both of those DNA came from the sperm.

&gt; You'll have to expand on that because my understanding is that scientific definitions still relay real/observable/factual phenomena. 

I'd like to focus on this and not lose this thread, because I think this distinction is... well, I'm sure it won't make you agree with me if I explain it, but it'll hopefully make me seem less baffled.

For the record, I am not trying to make the following sound pedantic -- I'm just really breaking it down as much as I can.  I know it's far more than I need to break it down to explain it.

Scientific definitions attempt to give handles to real phenomena.  That's very different from *relaying* real phenomena.  The handle may attempt to draw a circle with clear borders, while the reality has unclear borders.

For example, almost everything in medicine.  What's high blood pressure?  It just got redefined to include anything above 130 systolic.  It used to be over 140 systolic.  Which one's real?  Neither -- it's a continuum.  Higher blood pressure is associated with increased risk for cardiac disorders.  ""Hypertension"" relays this phenomenon... but the definition of hypertension is still arbitrary.

Fertilization is when an egg and sperm combine.  When exactly?  The acrosomal reaction of the sperm with the egg?  The egg undergoing meiosis II?  The chromosomes combining?  It's not specified.  In ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection), the intact sperm is injected into the egg.  Is it fertilized once the sperm has passed the point in the needle where the egg's membrane would be, or once the sperm is out of the needle?  How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?  The reality is complex and our language oversimplifies it.  We drew a big circle around that and said ""fertilization.""

So close your eyes and think about multicellular life.  Almost all of it involves sets of autonomous cells that function without being in direct physical contact with each other.  Sometimes they connect and disconnect.  The male anglerfish fuses with the female.  Trees have connected root systems but will function fine if you cut them apart or graft them back together.  Viruses fuse into the genome of their host cells.

We made this word ""organism"" to refer to one generally-discrete bunch of cells.  In some species fertilization happens outside of direct physical contact (most fish, for example).  In others the fertilized egg evolved specialized traits to implant into the bunch of cells that originally made the egg, which evolved a specialized environment for it.

There's a trend towards a sort of genetic discontinuity.  Genetic recombination happens and after fertilization there's a new set of DNA that probably hasn't been contained in a single phospholipid bilayer before.  That set of cells often (but not always!*) can be followed closely and results in a placenta (which will die) and another bit, the fetus.  That fetus has physical continuity with a baby (mind you, so did the egg).

(*Sometimes it forms two.  Sometimes zero!  Sometimes one, but with two heads!  Sometimes a molar pregnancy.  Sometimes two, but with only one head!  Sometimes one, with no heads!  And so on.)

Now, it's convenient to talk about these clumps of cells as separate, because they can behave in selfish and un-selfish ways that are important to talk about.  So we called them organisms.  Then we had to decide when one organism's gametes ended and another organism began.  So we chose fertilization (again, a vague handle) and it works out well for most purposes.

(""Species"" by the way, is an equally fuzzy term.  Well-intentioned, useful in a lot of purposes, but tries to put a handle on something that biology didn't put clear borders around.)

But!  There are a couple of purposes it really doesn't work well for.  An egg and a sperm combine and a little while later there are two sets of DNA.  Probably an organism, right?  Well, it turns out both of those DNA came from the sperm.  Now we call it a molar pregnancy, and not an organism, even though it's genetically unique and behaving in a selfish way.

Hey, now we did it with both of the DNA coming from females to make parthenogenesis.  Or from somatic cells to make a clone.  Now it's an organism!  The only difference was methylation patterns on the DNA.  So... organisms start at fertilized eggs, so long as the methylation patterns are compatible with eventual life?  This rule is getting complicated.

---

So every time you say ""because it's a different organism,"" I think, ""that word doesn't relay an ethically significant phenomenon.""  And it seems that every time I try to push on that, we wind up somewhere around ""well, it's a new organism of the human species, whereas before no such organism existed.""  And I think, ""yeah, we decided to call it those things.  But what has actually changed about the reality that makes it a person?""

102,"&gt;I agree with you that the situation is complex; that's why I feel that the pregnant person is the best person to make the decision.

I think this would be a very rational/understandable position *if* there was an underlying agreed-upon assumption that the fetus is *not* an entity of value equal to other people and therefore worthy of some protection/recognition in the equation. Because of course patients should make their own decisions for their body. But if this involves more than one patient, and I'd argue it does, and one has no way of expressing their thoughts/desires yet is at risk of harm, then it wouldn't be as straightforward as ""let only one patient make the decision for everyone regardless of how it impacts the other."" 

&gt;Would you be open to abortions being, broad strokes legal in cases where continued survival of the newborn is highly unlikely?

I would if I could know that those making such decisions were placing the fetus as a legitimate stakeholder (a patient) in the equation.

&gt;Organism is not rigorously defined (proof: I can find arguments for conjoined twins being one or two organisms), but it's also arbitrarily defined.

You'll have to expand on that because my understanding is that scientific definitions still relay real/observable/factual phenomena. 

&gt;Organisms are just defined as starting at fertilization. 

But they're not. I already outlined this above, when I was talking about how you could throw out *simplified* definitions or you could in fact relay the more in-depth criteria for how an organism is defined. So while an organism exists at fertilization, that's not the entirety of what it means to be an organism. 

&gt;Your version seems more complicated to me!

Oh? What was complicated about what I said?

&gt;Nothing is being attempted. To ascribe an attempt means to ascribe an intent -- the cells have no intent. I could just as well say that we are all failed attempts at conjoined twins.

It's a figure of speech, don't get too hung up on it. I agree cells don't have intent like adult humans do. Although you could also argue intent is a meaningless concept entirely as all of our thoughts/beliefs/desires/goals are just chemical reactions in the brain which may one day be as predictable as an oncoming round of mitosis in an 8-celled organism. 

&gt;Out of curiosity, do you think that an acardiac twin (which hardly possesses any organs above the diaphragm) is a person?

I believe that a living human organism and a person are synonyms. An acardiac twin is basically an ""attempted"" second organism (attempted in both cases I've used it referring to: cellular reactions instigated the formation of a second organism but its development failed completely.) I think it can also be argued that a second organism did exist at one point at the start of the twin's development, but it would be like if your friend Joe suddenly got his brains, heart, and lungs blown off his body. He'd die without machines running those parts of him and by all medical definitions he's not alive/not viable. Is Joe now a person? I mean he's a dead person. That's how I see it. Again with what limited knowledge I have of acardiac twins.

&gt;  &gt;  However, if you knew that a pregnancy was going to result in an neonate that would be guaranteed to die within an hour of birth, would you find its termination at 16 weeks acceptable?

&gt; I think that every human being deserves to be treated with some minimal level of respect. This may mean respecting their existence even as deformed/defective humans but also respecting that they can't make decisions for themselves yet and may not want to experience a short life of excruciating pain if given the choice. It's very unclear if that would be the case here. I think it's also worth considering that all pregnancies put the woman at risk of health problems and even death. So without knowing the clinical, social, financial, etc situation, it's kind of hard to make a judgement call and weigh all the pros and cons appropriately. 

I'd be very interested in exploring this more.

I agree with you that the situation is complex; that's why I feel that the pregnant person is the best person to make the decision.

&gt; &gt; ""Organism"" is just a word for ""clump of organic material between fertilization and cellular death.""

&gt; What constitutes a living human organism is absolutely rigorously defined in biology. The zygote, embryo, fetus, newborn, toddler, teen, and adult all qualify as a human organism, and it is the same human organism in different stages of development. 

Organism is not rigorously defined (proof: I can find arguments for conjoined twins being one or two organisms), but it's also *arbitrarily* defined.  Saying ""a zygote is more important than an unfertilized egg because the zygote is an organism"" is a circular statement.  Organisms are just defined as starting at fertilization.  Why is fertilization important?

Saying ""fertilization is important because after that it's an organism,"" while also saying ""an organism starts at fertilization,"" means you're just saying ""fertilization is important because after that it's fertilized.""

But we've been chasing this point for a long time.

&gt; Frankly it's almost laughable to me that people can bring up rare situations like TTTS but be continuously baffled by one of the most simple concepts in biology. 

I don't know anybody who is baffled by this, and I'm also confident enough in my credentials on the subject to be amused if you're implying I'm baffled by it.

What I'm emphasizing is the circular nature of the definition, the analytic/synthetic distinction in how it seems odd to me to use it as part of your definition for ethical significance.

104,"&gt;Because that's what this comes down to. ""Organism"" is just a word for ""clump of organic material between fertilization and cellular death.""

That's *one* way to define ""organism"" but not the only way. You can throw out a simplistic definition as you have. Or you can acknowledge all the traits an entity must have to qualify as an organism (capable of reproduction, growth and development, maintaining homeostasis, and are part of a larger species) which endow it with value.

Additionally, you ignore the ""human"" part when you only focus on ""organism."" Human organisms are generally capable of even more than the traits of your average organism. 

So no, it doesn't just come down to how you put it. 

&gt;Sometimes an organism is one person (me, for example. Or you). Sometimes it's two people (conjoined twins). Sometimes it's zero people (acardiac twin).

I would read the linked section above on twinning. 

Conjoined twins are two organisms (at least that is the process being attempted) who failed to fully separate. Same with acardiac twins, in which the malformation of blood supply leads to him/her failing to develop critical organs. I don't think this is as complicated as you're trying to portray it as. 

And I certainly don't think more confusing scenarios somehow negate the very straightforward, well-established facts that every grown human person is a human organism and their development *as* a human organism began as a zygote -- not an ovum.

 &gt;I honestly don't see a substantial difference between fertilization and implantation, in terms of potential to become an adult. These are sequential steps in increasing likelihood of becoming an adult.

I'm not sure why you even brought this up.

Yes, it is. Entity in this case refers to ""living human organism."" What constitutes a living human organism is absolutely rigorously defined in biology.

&gt;I don't actually value toddlers for their potential as adults, and neither do you. If you and I both knew that a toddler was going to die at the age of two, we wouldn't make killing it at the age of 18 months legal.

First of all, it's bad form to tell the person you're talking to what they think without checking first. 

Second, I would say instead ""I don't actually *only* value toddlers for their potential as adults,"" and that would be true. Human beings may be valued for multiple reasons. One of those reasons is still their potential for deeper morality, more advanced creativity, more meaningful impact on other organisms and the planet, etc, in the future. No it doesn't mean we'd kill them at 18 months, because as I said, there may be a lot of other reasons to value them even at a toddler stage.

I'm going to put forth a simplified answer to the morality question. 

Obviosuly zygotes are human organisms. I think you're asking ""so what?"" Which is fair. 

Human beings (organisms), or the species Homo sapiens, are valuable as individuals because of their uniquely advanced abilities in reason/rationality, creativity, technology, morality, and so on. This is a value-statement meaning *I* find it valuable, and I know many other people do too. 

Now the objection typically goes: but a zygote can't do any of those things. True. 

But I'd argue human beings aren't valued for their current capabilities. They're valued for their potential as individuals. Why do we generally care *way more* about the death of a newborn or toddler than the death of an older adult? Some of that is probably just evolutionary hormonal response. But I think it makes some rational sense too in correspondence with our value system: killing a human being at a younger age deprives them of their life experience as the entity we value (human being which can do x/y/z). They never get to actualize their potential as individuals and that's seen as a tragedy. Otherwise, they're cute but pretty useless. Pigs have more advanced cognitive function than newborns, yet killing them isn't seen as this tragedy (to most). 

I think the most consistent stance with our value system is to place just as much value on the even younger human being, the embryo and fetus. That is the same individual as the newborn. ",1,1515546819,2018-01-09 20:13:39

&gt;You cannot have moral standing if you have never been conscious, because there is no ""you"". 


I understand that is the point you are trying to make. I think the flaw is that you are looking at the end of our existence and trying to use the same standard for the beginning of our existence. The problem here is that it takes the mind to keep our body running in the end, but it doesn't require the mind in the beginning. All it takes is the body in the beginning. Perhaps I should have said this first, but my first point was to clarify that our bodies, regardless of what happens to our minds, are owned by us and should not be violated.

&gt;...A condom (or abstinence!) might just as well prevent a future consciousness, and neither of us objects to that.


&gt;Let me ask you, what do you see the ethical significance of fertilization as being? Challenge: answer this without using the biological definition of an organism as beginning at conception, or demonstrate an ethical significance of that definition.

I think the answer to your question rests on the definition of a human organism. You and I are human organisms, and we became human organisms not at birth, not at the beginning of consciousness but as a zygote. Sperm are destroyed in the creation of a zygote. They may have the potential to become human, but they aren't. They are part of a life cycle of a species that is sentient, but they are not yet part of the species itself.

Humans are not valuable in virtue of their DNA, they are valuable in virtue of the kind of thing they are. This does not preclude other species from being valuable, as well. So, if we ever meet an alien race, and we see they have value in the same way humans have value, my stance on personhood would not preclude me from arguing against the termination of unborn aliens either.

People think there is something special that happens at conception, but this does not stand up to logical scrutiny.

1. First, what *is* a fertilized egg? Not what it can become -- which is a full-grown human. But, what is it, at that point? And, looking at it at that one point in time, how does it compare to other life-forms. Clearly, at that point is it less complex a life form than every an insect, leave alone a vertebrate or a loving dog or cat. 
There is no way to argue that is should have any rights if all we consider is its current status. The only plausible argument to make for its rights is to say that it can now become a full grown human. In other words, the argument is based on its potential, not on its current state. 

2. But, an egg has potential too. As do sperm. The case for the egg is very strong, because the chance that it gets fertilized is very strong. And, regardless, if one is principled about protecting potential, one can see that if one stops eggs through regular use of contraception, then one has almost definitely prevented some human beings from coming into existence. 

Personally, I am pro-abortion and think it should be legal all the way to birth. It is not an easy position to convince people of.

Sperm and egg actually don't usually combine in the womb.  They typically combine in a fallopian tube.  Sometimes they combine in a petri dish.  In either case, they won't form a human being if left to their own devices.  They will form a human being if they implant in a uterine wall, don't have any major chromosomal issues, and are provided with massive amounts of nutrition.

And the cut off point you might not have been able to give him on the spur of the moment might be when sentience is possible. Before 26 weeks of gestation those fetuses cannot feel pain/be sentient because their nervous system is simply not developped enough. Basically, they are like those humans from which we harvest organs.

But even then, if your dad doesn't accept that as a cut off point, you can simply base your entire argumentation on a very simple thing: a women's right to her own body.

Even if your right to your own body hurts others, it is still your right and no one can take it from you. Donating blood might save many others but no one can force you into it. If your child after birth when it is fully sentient and aware gets sick and needs a new organ, no one can force you to give it even if you are the child's only chance for survival. Is a fully aware child (let's say 7 yo) less important than a non-sentient fetus? A lot of people then argue that you cannot compare situations because in one case inaction leads to the birth and in the second case inaction leads to the death of the child. Then modify it slightly for them:

the mother agreed to be connected to her child so her own organs would support the child's body. Inaction means the child lives. Then after a few months the mother changes her mind and doesn't want to be connected any longer. No doctor or court in their mind would force her to continue. Action leads to the death of the child. 

If you argue that in those situations women should be forced to help the child, then you also must forfeit your own right to your body. This involves then: being forced into donating blood or organs not only to save your family but strangers who are no less deserving of life.",1,1515324665,2018-01-07 06:31:05

When you're asleep, from YOUR point of view, you don't exist. The point of being pro life isn't to save a FUTURE existence, the point is to save a current, EXISTING human life. With contraception, there is no CURRENT human life. And just like it would be wrong to kill you in your sleep despite having no mental capabilities in that moment, it doesn't matter what the infant's point of view is. The child is a complete human organism, just like you and me, and it deserves a right to exist, just like you and me.

In ontological reality the pre-born infant does in fact exist. And that is all that matters.

You keep saying things about future consciousness, having a stake in the world, and ""stealing a life"" which seem to apply to an embryo just as easily. So why does present/previous consciousness matter, when all your justifications refer to future consciousness?

[This](http://www.abortionfacts.com/reardon/rape-incest-and-abortion-searching-beyond-the-myths) discusses how rape and incest survivors felt traumatized by abortion, or chose to keep their children. [This](http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/PDF/Articles/Women%20Victimized%20By%20-%20Nancy%20Valko.pdf) discusses how prolife wants to serve women who self report mental health issues after abortion, because some women in fact do. 


&gt;And then there's the tragedy of giving birth to a loved and wanted but severely handicapped child or a child doomed to an early, painful death due to birth defects.

So is it okay to kill newborns suffering from such difficulties? [Think about what you are saying...](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/charlie-gard-dies-and-his-parents-say-their-beautiful-little-boy-has-died-06lkn7wkg)

&gt;And then there's the woman already raising four or five kids whose husband takes off, leaving her destitute. 

Should we not offer ways to help these women, instead of telling them their only choice is to have someone kill their child? There are adoption centers(these are different than foster care, so don't even bother bringing that up) and pregnancy crisis centers for these women.

&gt;... the 11-yr-old girl impregnated by her father. Or her mother's boyfriend. Or her older brother.

Already pointed out, see the link on rape stats.  It's ridiculous to use such a small percentage as an excuse for all abortions. There is a lot of information available regarding how rape victims feel about pregnancy and abortion. Any rape victim who seeks an abortion should have as much understanding as one who says that the experience would further traumatize them or who feel that the baby is not to blame.

But down to the point: a child conceived in rape is still a child. My heart hurts for those who become pregnancy as a result of rape, and I can see why so many pro-choice would see it as a valid argument. But it still doesn't negate the fact that abortion kills a human being, and we should look for other ways to help the rape victim, rather then sending her down to the clinic to ""get fixed up"", after which she will presumably be forced to go back to her rapist.",1,1514933229,2018-01-02 17:47:09

I can argue the pro-life position without bringing morality or religion into it, though lets not pretend that those things don’t matter. Even those that argue for small government believe that governments are required to protect the lives of all human beings, as is reflected in the declaration of independence. So is the fetus a human being? Of course, it has its own distinct human dna, and will develop as a human being through he age of about 25 when it will be fully developed. Is it alive? I don’t see how you could argue otherwise. If you want to use the 7 characteristics of life (composed of cells, molecular and cellular organization, use energy, respond to environment, grow, adapt to environment, and reproduce), though they are more frequently used to define a species as being alive, the only problem is reproduction, but a fetus can reproduce just as easily as a 1-year-old. Would you rather use tangible characteristics or complexity to define if it is alive? By the end of week 4 the growing being that has its own dna already is developing hands, eyes, and legs. We could use comparison to determine whether or not the government should protect the fetus. One would obviously expect legal action against one who removed life support from a coma patient on whim. I’m not saying there arent differences between a coma patient and a fetus, but as far as humanity and life are concerned, they are the same. The biggest difference between them, however, is that the fetus is much more likely to live a long happy life if support is sustained than a coma patient. At the very least the government should be consistent with its legislation. Why is a man charged with manslaughter if he drunkenly kills a woman’s fetus in a car accident. If its just tissue it shouldn’t matter. Why can’t i prostitute myself if it’s “my body, my choice”? But let’s talk a bit about morality because we need some level of morality. For example, without morals no life has any intrinsic value. We could slaughter the homeless because they really don’t contribute to society. Murder is only as costly to society as the victim’s net worth. Genocide would potentially be worth considering. So at the basic level, morality is important, and IF we can say that a fetus is a human life, but we should be able to terminate it at the will of the mother, then we are terribly inconsistent and in danger of returning to slavery or adopting a new form of the degradation of humanity.

When you say that “Life begins at fertilization/conception” you are saying that a human being exists at the moment when haploid human gametes fuse into a fertilized diploid human egg. Saying life begins at conception basically means that a single cell is, in fact, a human being. There is a reason not a single scientific organization supports this idea. Sometime in the not very distant future, probably in our quest to understand cancer, we will discover the mechanisms for unlocking the genetic code which prevents unchecked cell division. Since every single human cell contains the full genetic information of every other cell, it will become possible to take a skin cell and cause it to divide and differentiate into any desired organ, or even into a complete human being, genetically identical to the donor. The process is called 'cloning'. Will we then say that every skin cell is a human being? Rather should we not say that both zygotes and skin cells represent potential human beings with differing probabilities of actually becoming a full human? Valuing the point of conception is an unreasonable scientific position, it should be realized that one is putting a premium on is a potential and probability for humanness, and that it is not necessarily true that a fertilized egg is, in fact, a full human being at conception.",1,1514679263,2017-12-30 19:14:23

After all, a human sperm is not an inanimate rock. It is a valid subject for study by a biologist, not a geologist! And, it is also human. If one lays down a rule that anything that can be classified as ""living"" plus can be classified as ""human"" should be allowed to live, ... all contraception would be wrong. 

One can rationalize a bit and say you want to extend that line to conception: since that's confirmation that the particular living cells can make it into a full human being. The real decision here would not be scientific: one would be making a moral judgement, and only then asking a scientist to tell you when conception really happens... and even there, you would have to define your ethical terms in a way that a scientist could understand.

Or you could make your ""line"": viability outside the womb. Again, the key judgement is not a scientific one. The key judgement is the moral one.

&gt; What about unborn babies that have brains and can think? 

Distraction. Do you, or do you not, have proof zygotes have personalities or that personalities can exist without a developed brain? Without proof, it's safe to assume a person does not exist at conception and abortion isn't murder, because a person isn't killed in an abortion.

She didn't believe anyone had the right to tell a woman what she could or couldn't do with her body. I think part of that came from her years as a public health nurse and the tragic stories she heard on a daily basis. Our town was next to a military base, so there were many babies whose fathers were soldiers -- many of whom refused to even acknowledge their offspring (back then, there was no way to prove paternity). Some of the women were on their fourth or fifth child, with a different father for each baby.

Mom also saw how difficult it was to find adoptive parents for mixed-race children (this was the 1950s) and what kind of a life those little kids were facing. The mothers were on welfare, and often there wasn't much to eat in their homes.

The experience turned her into a devoted supporter of Planned Parenthood -- I'll always respect her for that.

In high school, I saw what happened when girls ""got themselves pregnant"" and had to drop out of school. Only the ones who had given their babies up or married were allowed to return. The ones who married didn't seem as happy and certainly not as carefree as they'd been. The ones who had given their babies up seemed either quieter or much more ""out there"", as if defying anyone to criticize them (I thought they showed the most courage). 

Some girls kept their babies and raised them alone -- I never knew what happened to them. I'm sure quite a few others had abortions, but it wasn't talked about (illegal and ""not something good girls did""). I think several became very sick with ""period"" issues and went to live with an aunt -- just guessing, but I think they might have tried to abort themselves. 

I lived in Phoenix around that time; I don't know how active Planned Parenthood was permitted to be in Arizona. In home ec and PE, we were never show health films or instructed in what happens during sex or exactly *how* pregnancy happens!! It was a very politically and morally conservative area, which didn't stop us from experimenting with our boyfriends! I guess the school board assumed if we didn't know anything about sex we wouldn't try to find out on our own. Yeah, that always works.",1,1514229694,2017-12-25 14:21:34
356,"**Computational theory of mind**

In philosophy, a computational theory of mind names a view that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1961, and developed by the MIT philosopher and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor (who was Putnam's PhD student) in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Despite being vigorously disputed in analytic philosophy in the 1990s (due to work by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others), the view is common in modern cognitive psychology and is presumed by many theorists of evolutionary psychology; in the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008).

The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computation that arises from the brain acting as a computing machine.

The Jane Collective or Jane, officially known as the Abortion Counseling Service of Women’s Liberation, was an underground service in Chicago, Illinois affiliated with the Chicago Women's Liberation Union that operated from 1969 to 1973, a time when abortion was illegal in the United States. The collective was started by activists in the women's liberation movement in an effort to address the increasing number of unsafe abortions being performed by untrained providers. Since illegal abortions were not only dangerous but very expensive, the founding members of the collective believed that they could provide women with safer and more affordable access to abortions. In an informational brochure distributed by Jane in 1969 they characterized abortion as a social problem that mirrored the oppression of women in social and political arenas.

369,"&gt; I had no idea abortion training used manual aspiration (although I didn't mean to insinuate that they'd only be used illegally- rather, that like the article suggests, that the group saw in them that value).

I think the article played up that value inappropriately.  I agree it's a value, but it's also a value for international ob/gyn, or rural ob/gyn, or people who won't go into ob/gyn but want to offer gyn services in their pediatrics or family medicine clinics.

&gt; I'm very curious- how many interest groups are there in the medical fields that do not-for-profit training- is it an industry-wide thing?

There are plenty of interest groups in med schools, typically organized by medical students.  Some of them have larger organizations with things like a budget and employees who aren't M.D.s.  I don't really know how many of them they are comparable to MSFC, but I know that my non-ob/gyn friends did their own things, like met and practiced setting bones.  Or doing lumbar punctures.

Nope, I arranged it as part of an interest group, same as for the papaya training.

There are similar training set-ups for a bunch of other medical procedures.

&gt;  Furthermore, the tools being used here for training are specifically chosen precisely because they could lend themselves to clandestine and/or illegal procedures; while there's nothing wrong with manual suction aspiration (as opposed to vacuum suction aspiration), standard training in a medical facility would likely use the latter.

If standard training did that (which it doesn't), that would be a failure on the part of standard training.  It's good to know both manual and electric aspiration techniques.  They're not chosen because they could lend themselves to clandestine or illegal procedures.  They're chosen because they're portable and flexible and useful for early procedures.

&gt; But the folks here aren't just doing regular ol' training like you mention for vasectomies. They're doing it with a goal in mind: get people who are lacking training (often due to political machinations) ready in the event of the worst-case scenario.

That may now be on people's minds, but the training is the exact same as it was when things didn't seem dire.  Do you see what I mean?

I'm sure it will already be useful in places with severe TRAP laws and like one person said in the article, it will be useful now for underage patients with no other options.  It is just a shame that they have to go back to learning how to use kits that are used to perform secret abortions in rural Africa, anti-choicers honestly want to force women to live like they are in a third world country.  

I also hope it becomes easier for people to obtain the abortion pill here.  Currently Texas women go to Mexico to get it if they live too far away from a clinic.  And Women on Web sends people the abortion pill and Women on Waves goes around in a ship providing abortion services, though I do not believe they currently service the U.S. since even though abortion can be hard to come by in places it is technically legal.   Also some women buy the pills online, but usually you just never know what you are getting.  We need a safe, discreet solution to procuring the abortion pill. 

Also if I am not mistaken in the past a group of women trained themselves on how to evacuate each other's uteruses so that they could perform abortions on each other and others that needed their help.  I believe that they came up with their own system and from their experience it seemed to be safe.  Though a lot of times the women did not have a confirmed pregnancy, so take that with a grain of salt.  A lot of times they used it to  suction out their uteruses so that they would not get their period, I'm not sure how safe that is for extended use. 

Women on Web seems to be having some success in religious, anti-choice countries like Poland and Ireland.  Though there have been cases of the pills being confiscated.  I believe a lot of Irish women who order the pills have them shipped to Northern Ireland and then go pick them up.  Also a lot of Irish women travel to England to have a legal abortion performed and Polish women travel to neighboring, less religious countries to get the procedure done.  The U.S. already has Texan women traveling to Mexico for the pills, I wonder if maybe Canada would end up being a hotspot for abortion care for American women if abortion was ever made illegal here?

Though some desperate women will still resort to performing coat hanger abortions or using other dangerous methods like they did before Roe.  That is why legal abortion is so important.  Illegality doesn't stop abortion, it just makes it where well off or well connected women get an illegal, but relatively safe abortion or travel outside of the country to obtain the procedure legally, while less well off and less connected women perform their own risky abortions and either do it right and succeed or do it wrong and risk getting sick or dying. That was the pre-Roe U.S. But hopefully these trained possible illegal providers and the other methods that I mentioned for obtaining a secret abortion help save the lives of American women if the anti-choicers ever succeed in forcing women to live like they are in a third world country again.",1,1513961837,2017-12-22 11:57:17

&gt;...we, as humans, are valuable because of our inherent nature as rational, moral agents. What makes us a person is not the current capacities that we can fulfill. What makes us a person is our nature, our inherent capacities to fulfill these functions. These inherent capacities are present from fertilization.

&gt;...So this raises another question: Who qualifies for personhood? The answer is simple: anyone who has a nature similar to that of us. Those with a rational, moral nature. So being human (that is, belonging to species Homo sapiens, because of the nature that humans have) is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition for personhood. If supernatural beings exist, like God and angels, then they qualify. Extraterrestrials, like Klingons and Vulcans of Star Trek lore, if they exist, would also qualify if they have a nature as rational, moral agents. Incidentally, this means that if extraterrestrials exist, pro-life advocates would oppose aborting the extraterrestrial preborn, as well.

&gt;I think that this one is key.

&gt;Your philosophy relies on very clear lines. My philosophy is very open to blurred lines. (Ugh, but very opposed to the song lyrics.) So my approach to trying to convert you (slash explore our differences) will be based on finding a line that you can't unblur.

True, such is the problem with objective philosophy, and trust me whsn I say I've run into problems stemming from it - for example, as a Kantian, lying is a moral wrong, and there have been times in my life where I've had no choice but to do that. It certainly isn't easy.

The constitutional right to medical care that they cite is not some sort of all-encompassing right (as you point out, the only time provision of care is non-negotiable is in emergent situations), but rather the fact that the government cannot prevent you from seeking to access said care (i.e. keeping you locked up in a detention center and in effect condemning you to continuing a pregnancy).",1,1513833671,2017-12-21 00:21:11

I realise that because we are on different philosophical sides of the spectrum, I may not be able to convince yourp of my position however I hope I can bring you to understand it.

The duty following procreation is an objective, as Kant believed that morality was absolute and there is no excuse for not holding to a moral standard. Kant argued that every rational being existed as an end in itself, and not as a means to an end(The body should not be confused with the free being present in the fetus. Although the fetus is not able to exercise his autonomy and reason yet, the body belongs to a rational being that is already a person- as this is a stage of development- and should be treated with respect to his dignity).[This article] (blog.secularprolife.org/2013/02/arguments-against-fetal-personhood.html) puts it better than I feel I can.
&lt;---shared not because I think it'll change your mind, but because I hope to widen the bridge of understanding between us.

I'll add my own sediments, but I'd like to add something from Kant's Metaphysics of 
Morals-

&gt;Just as there arose from one’s duty to oneself, that is, to the humanity in one’s own person, a right (ius personale) of both sexes to acquire each other as persons in the manner of things by marriage, so there follows from procreation in this community a duty to preserve and care for its offspring; that is, children, as persons, have by their procreation an original innate (not acquired) right to the care of their parents until they are able to look after themselves, and they have this right direct by law (lege), that is, without any special act being required to establish this right.

&gt;For the offspring is a person, and it is impossible to form a concept of the production of a being endowed with freedom through a physical operation. So from a practical point of view it is quite correct and even necessary idea to regard the act of procreation as one by which we have brought a person into the world without his consent and on our own initiative, for which deed the parents incur an obligation to make the child content with his condition so far as they can. - They cannot destroy their children as if he were something they had made ((since a being endowed with freedom cannot be a product of this kind)) or as if he were their property, nor can they even just abandon him to chance, since they have brought not merely a worldly being but a citizen of the world into a condition which not now be indifferent to them even just according to concepts of right.”

Not being able to -temporarily- exercise autonomy is very different of not having autonomy and dignity. 

I will add here that Kantian philosophy does not exclude animals from needless torture or suffering, rather it discourages such tactics. 

“If he is not to stifle his own feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.  We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.”

Kant’s view was that we should refrain from pointless cruelty to animals, as shown above. Another argument I've seen made branching off of this is that animal abuse leads to suffering in humans as well because very few people enjoy hurting or torturing animals.

&gt;At what point in evolution does it become wrong to do this?

I would consider it immoral, as I'm morally opposed to utilitarian principles. Perhaps it may bring a great benefit, but it does so at the expense of those who would become human beings ",1,1513637636,2017-12-18 17:53:56

432,"""why would the doctor need to dismember a foetus to abort it really""

In abortions after the first trimester, the tissue may indeed need to come out in pieces, although ""dismember"" is a unnecessarily emotional word meant to be evoke disgust, etc..  Earlier on, the uterus can be evacuated by suction aspiration (applying suction through a cannula, a thin plastic tube), but as the fetus becomes more developed, the tissue will also have be removed in pieces with forceps.  Remember, everything has to come out through the cervix, which is normally very small and nowhere near the size, softness, and stretchiness it becomes during labor.  If the abortion removes tissue in pieces, the doctor typically needs to examine everything and somewhat re-assemble after the fact to make sure all the pieces are there and accounted for.  It sounds gruesome, but it's for the woman's safety- leaving tissue in the womb can lead to serious, even potentially deadly, infection.

Having said that, though- always take any pictures from the anti-abortion movement with a grain of salt (if you even take them seriously at all).  Always question the source- someone has to take and then disseminate the pictures, and it's not like abortion providers are in the habit of snapping pictures to share on Facebook.  Frequently, pictures that are supposedly of abortions are actually fetuses who were stillborn, miscarried, or [Voldemort](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/f/f9/Voldemort%27s_mutilated_soul.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111019232913) (that last picture is from the Harry Potter movie, but just as a caution to squeamish people- he's gross-looking).  And yes, photoshop may be employed as well.

But ultimately, abortions are kinda gross and bloody, the same way any surgical procedure is gross and bloody, and yes, a fair number of people do or would feel conflicted or squeamish at later-term abortion imagery when/if they see what it actually looks like.  The task at hand is to separate out personal revulsion from moral feelings.  Going ""Yuck!"" is not a substitute for an actual thought-out argument.",1,1513372062,2017-12-15 16:07:42

454,"I want to preface this by saying I am a man. 

For as long as I can remember abortion being an issue, I've always thought it was preposterous to equate the rights of a living, breathing infant, with a premature fetus. That was back when I actually had a lot of Christian values. 

Now that I am a firm non-believer, when I see the issue come up and realize that the majority of conservative evangelicals care more about an unborn person than most of their fellow men and women, it has reaffirmed the pro-choice belief I have always had. 

These are the people who will vote that those with unplanned pregnancies shouldn't have a choice to terminate their pregnancy but don't care whatsoever about any other effect that outcome might have. Most of them don't care about insuring women have access to contraceptives. They will profess that abstinence only education should be taught even though it has proven to be ineffective compared to proper sexual education. They don't take into account, or care about things like overpopulation or the perpetuation of poverty that unplanned pregnancies cause for lots of women. I've had pro life friends tell me that if women don't want to get pregnant then they shouldn't have sex, as if sexual desire isn't one of the strongest natural forces in our biology.  Couple that with young teens with brains still developing, who can't fully comprehend the consequences of their actions and for the most part think they are immune to adverse consequences because their sense of reason isn't fully developed. Pro-life voters are also for the most part against social welfare programs that would help these mothers take care of the child they didn't want to conceive.     And of course when they say adoption is always an alternative, they can conveniently ignore how truly terrible America's foster care system is. 

In short, I believe in quality of life, not quantity of life. Forcing women to have unwanted children, on average, lessens the quality of both the mother and child's lives and makes society as a whole pay for it one way or another, whether it is through taxes, fewer jobs, more contributors to things like climate change, or higher crime rates.

Of course it's impossible to be truly free if you don't have control over your reproduction.

It wasn't until later, in college, that I started to become more of a feminist and think about it beyond just the ""no unnecessary regulation"" aspect, that I really identified as pro-choice, rather than just having a mere opinion on abortion.  I was very big into sex positivity at the time and learning as much as I possibly could about sexuality, sexual orientation, birth control, etc., and learning about abortion just kind of flowed from there.

&gt; should they also be able to terminate a 1 month old infant? And if not, what makes the situation different then a baby just before birth (while still in the womb)?

Because of that. It's still inside the body, and sadly sometimes that far in the pregnancy you have to make a choice whether it'll be your life or the fetus's.",1,1513122903,2017-12-12 18:55:03
470,"I second this. It is not my job to push an agenda on anyone based on my own beliefs. Another woman's decision does not affect me and is not my business. Her body, her choice. 

In addition, I don't not think a child is a child until it is life sustaining from its mother without severely invasive medical assistance. The mother still gets to choose up to that point.

471,"I believe this is between a woman and her doctor, and it's none of my business. It is not my place to declare some cut-off point where I *feel* abortions shouldn't be allowed. This is a question that pro-lifers ask a lot, usually in order to make the claim that there is no big distinction between a baby in the womb and outside of it. In reality, 9th month abortions just aren't a thing that happens and not a thing to be concerned about or attempt to use to make a point about anything. Women who don't want to be pregnant will get an abortion much earlier. And once it gets that far in the pregnancy, a c-section would likely be done, not an abortion. 

I trust women to make decisions for themselves. If a woman wants to abort later in the pregnancy than is typical, I trust that she has thought long and hard about this and it is the right decision for her and a doctor agrees. Women don't have late term abortions on a whim. More often these are women who very much wanted a baby but there is some horrible medical complication either with her or with the fetus. I trust women and their doctors to make these often painful decisions.",1,1513122419,2017-12-12 18:46:59

Per [Guttmacher](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions), last updated 12-1-17, Pennsylvania limits abortion to 24 weeks from the last menstrual period, ergo abortions at or after 20 weeks are allowed, but those after 24 weeks are curtailed.

According to [Rewire](https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law/pennsylvania-20-week-dismemberment-abortion-ban-hb-77/), a similar bill, SB888, failed to pass in 2016.

As to why change the law- well, there are different theories floating around.  Anti-abortion folks will tell you it's because science has now illuminated to us that a 20-week fetus can feel pain ([it cannot](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429)).  There's always the general usefulness of stirring up your base and rallying the constituents by bringing up abortion and getting a recorded vote that you can later use in your campaign (or conversely, your opponent's vote).  And I personally view it as a way to undermine Roe v. Wade, whose trimester framework (must be legal in the first two trimesters, able to be banned by states in the third trimester) has been in place since the ruling.  By moving the cut-off time into the late second trimester, particularly when using false science, they seek to destroy the trimester framework, which will allow for further legislative attacks for earlier and earlier abortions, based on, again, more false science.",1,1513112555,2017-12-12 16:02:35

Metaphor: You go to a Casino to have fun. It’s a risk, but you can get a lot of money. Do you know you might lose money? Do you accept that responsibility? 

Metaphor 2:  You and your soulmate decide to have a kid. It’s a risk, a lot of shit happens to kids and it’s a lot of stress. A lot could go wrong, it could go right also. Could be the best thing, could be something in the middle. Either way you both decide to have a kid and accept whatever responsibility that comes with that

So I hope you get the message of those 2 metaphors. There’s a chance and you both take responsibility for it when having sex.  That’s the consent to use the body of another human.   And it seems like sex should just be fun and shit. But it’s a bit of a catch 22... I mean perhaps it wouldn’t be as fun without that danger. ",1,1512806171,2017-12-09 02:56:11

No, the presumption of innocence is an American ideal, but when we have video/imagery/audio of someone committing/admitting rape or sexual assault it's a bit of a different matter as for someone who's a politician\role-model you are held to a higher standard.

34,"I see there being two main pro-choice arguments. One about the legality or morality of restricting abortion, the second about the morality of actual abortion.

Firstly there is the right to bodily autonomy. This argument is basically that the woman, like all other persons, has (or should have) an ownership over her own body that supersedes any claim the State has to use her organs without consent.

Or to put it another way, a woman must consent at all points in the pregnancy to let the fetus use her womb, and if at any point she withdraws that consent and wishes to remove the fetus the State cannot take over ownership of the woman's organs to protect the fetus.

This may seem some what odd that we speak of a woman owning her internal organs, but if you think about it *everyone else* already has that right. The State does not force people to give blood, does not force people to donate organs. In fact if any liberal tried to introduce a bill into law that claimed the state has the right to take over your organs for the greater good there would be outrage.

Notice this principle makes no claim to the personhood of the fetus. Ultimately it doesn't matter, since even if the fetus was to be considered a fully fledged person with all the rights that entails the State still wouldn't have the right to take ownership of a woman's organs to protect that life.

This is why many conservatives and libertarians who may feel abortion is morally wrong do not believe in government restriction in this area and are also pro-choice. They believe restricting abortion is the State moving into an area it has no right to be in and that the idea of a government that can essentially violate your body for some principle of greater good is a government they don't want.

A second argument, which deals with the morality of abortion itself, is that for most of the pregnancy the fetus is not a person. There is really no other way to define personhood other than as a manifestation of the human brain. Even if you believe in a soul or 'mind' distinct from the physical brain it is pretty clear that soul or 'mind' is *in* the brain. A simple thought experiment reveals this, imagine your brain or head was transplanted onto another persons body (something we are actually very close to being able to do medically) where would ""you"" be. Would ""you"" still be back in the original body from the neck down? Or would ""you"" be where ever your brain is, in or on the new body. The answer is of course obvious, ""you"" would be where ever your brain is. Remove your brain from a body, keep the body alive but destroy the brain, where are ""you""? ""You"" are clearly dead. If doctors some how grew another brain in your old body from scratch that would be a completely different person.

So it is pretty clear that the aspect of human life we value, that gives a human being value over other animals, their personhood, is a property of the higher functions of the human brain. Until that develops the ""person"" does not exist yet.

So how can a fetus that has not yet developed a these higher brain functions (or even a brain) be considered a person? They cannot, they are as much a person as the brainless body left behind after your brain was removed and destroyed.

The ""person"" that fetus may grow into does not yet exist, and has no rights in the same way that any theoretically person that does not exist yet has no rights. 

The medical community has not reached consensus exactly when a fetus develops these high brain functions that produce what we could call personhood, but it is pretty clear that an embryo or early term fetus doesn't. The vast majority of abortions take place at this point and to my mind are completely moral. No person is being destroyed since no person yet exists. It is no less moral to end that pregnancy and prevent that person from eventually coming into existence than it would have been to not have sex the night of the conception and also prevent that person from potentially coming into existence. People who don't exist yet have no rights since they don't exist yet.",1,1511563775,2017-11-24 17:49:35

2) Even if the baby IS alive (it is) that doesn't matter because it's inconvenient for the mother. This is the nature of evil ""your life is inconvenient so die"".

The ideas is that women 'deserve better' than to have either abortion or financial hardship as their only two options.

While in this argument are some genuine points about un-friendly society is to mothers, these groups do not put any serious weight behind providing services to help women in pregnancy or new mothers in college, since there is very little serious appetite in the anti-choice movement to help mothers after the child is born, particularly using state funds. Much easier to just restrict abortion choice and then say they are doing it for women",1,1511562204,2017-11-24 17:23:24
39,"“There is a concept called body autonomy. It’s generally considered a human right. Bodily autonomy means a person has control over whom or what uses their body, for what, and for how long. It’s why you can’t be forced to donate blood, tissue, or organs. Even if you are dead. Even if you’d save or improve 20 lives. It’s why someone can’t touch you, have sex with you, or use your body in any way without your continuous consent.

A fetus is using someone’s body parts. Therefore under bodily autonomy, it is there by permission, not by right. It needs a person’s continuous consent. If they deny and withdraw their consent, the pregnant person has the right to remove them from that moment. A fetus is equal in this regard because if I need someone else’s body parts to live, they can also legally deny me their use. 

By saying a fetus has a right to someone’s body parts until it’s born, despite the pregnant person’s wishes, you are doing two things.

1. Granting a fetus more rights to other people’s bodies than any born person.
2. Awarding a pregnant person fewer rights to their body than a corpse.""

No, since if that was the interpretation of UVVA it would make it unconstitutional (though certainly trying to leverage a tragedy to sneak in personhood to the foetus was the goal of the Republicans who introduced that law).

I am not a legal expert but my understanding of UVVA and other laws like them is that the only way they stays the right side of Roe v Wade is that instead of defining a embryo as a person they rather state the obvious that it is a human entity and expanding laws against violent acts to include such ""entities"", using similar laws such as inherientence laws that also take into account the fetus without defining it as a legal person.

As the Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled about a similar law

I understand what your saying about “potential for life” but if we held everything to this standard we would also have to force people to donate blood and organs against their will because of the “potential” to save an actual living human beings life. Are you in favor of the government forcing you to donate your organs to someone else? Probably not, because it would violate your bodily autonomy. It is your right as a person to choose whether or not you donate a kidney, regardless of any human life it could save. Women have the same bodily autonomy. I am in charge of my body, and will not carry out a pregnancy I don’t want to carry out because I don’t want my body to be used that way. It’s the same thing. You can’t hold a fetus to a higher standard than the already sick people who need kidneys and blood transfusions, those people are already living and we don’t force other people to donate organs to save them, so why would we force a woman to use her body to support a life that isn’t even here yet?

[First, here are the statistics proving what I said.](http://lib.post.ca.gov/Publications/Building%20a%20Career%20Pipeline%20Documents/Safe_Harbor.pdf) \ Instead of saying I pulled it out of my ass, at least just ask for my sources. Based on this, a woman raising a single child is not a good option for both the child and the state, as the child will cost the state money when they commit crime and the mother will use welfare money (As the source states, 90% of welfare recipients are single mothers)

&gt; I would say that is the second most idiotic thing I've read on this thread, right after forcing women to gestate and give birth to a child they don't want.

But then again, the woman had measures she could have taken to prevent the pregnancy, and the father also had measures he could have taken before getting the woman pregnant. This pregnancy is a result of irresponsibility, after all. 

To simply kill the fetus because it is inconvenient for the people that had sex, IMO, I don't think is justified. However, this also depends on what you find to be life or not, and that killing this ""bundle of cells"" is morally right or wrong depending on what you view those bundle of cells as.

I would take a more nuanced view to that. I would maintain that it is not being human that gives a person value, but rather then personhood produced by the human brain.

I don't get mad, I don't call it their fault.  I see every unplanned pregnancy as a contraceptive failure.  Why?  Because one of the steps of a contraceptive preventing a pregnancy is *somebody using it.*

You use broken condoms as a reason to feel torn.  Well, why don't you still call it ""the woman's responsibility""?  She should have been using a more effective method of contraception, like an IUD!  And how about rape?  She should have known that she had a risk of being raped, she lives in the USA!  She should have gotten a contraceptive method just in case.

These are absurd arguments, I know, and that's my point -- I don't think there's a benefit in allowing things based on ""fault.""

130,"&gt;&gt; You are painfully ignorant of how easy it to get pregnant, despite using birth control. The failure rate of popular forms of birth control per year is 15% for condoms and 7% for the pill/patch.
&gt;
&gt;I hear from other pro-choice people on this subreddit that it's 3% for condoms. Could you please clarify on the statistics with a source? That would be greatly appreciated!

That's with with perfect use. And condoms are 3% at best.

[Source](https://www.acog.org/-/media/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/co642a.ashx?h=878&amp;w=714&amp;hash=5D880CED1097147DF17C984E09F3A6A1EA201E20) from ACOG (American Congress of Obstetrician and Gynecologists). I actually under estimated the failure rates, but generally, most sources agree, +/- 2%.

&gt;&gt; Pro life Republicans also try to stop healthcare plans from covering birth control and certain groups are also trying to defund Planned Parenthood which does provide these things for free.
&gt;
&gt;Even if they aren't free, condoms and the pill are fairly cheap and are not an economic burden to anyone.

Condoms are not a burden if they are given out for free. And the pill is cheap, but if you're not making any money, it is a huge financial burden. It should be available for free. The societal benefit is huge.

&gt;&gt; I find this opinion morally reprehensible. People do not forfeit their right to self determination because they had sex.
&gt;
&gt;It is not because they had sex that they lose this right, rather it is because **they decided to get pregnant**. Having sex is not the issue, the issue is not using birth control and then deciding to use abortion as a birth control (IMO)

I am confused here. The vast majority of abortions are from unintended pregnancies. More than half of women getting abortions DID use contraceptives. And most of those who didn't use them did so because they thought the risk of pregnancy is low when it is actually super high. These women need access to better education and then contraceptive methods.

What you are stating is parroting of right wing talking points, rather than a reflection of reality. You may not have been lied to, but you were intentionally misled.

&gt;&gt; I am struggling to find this article, as what I can see is a breakage rate higher than that abortion rate. The Guttmacher institute has a lot of info on their site.
&gt;
&gt;[Here you go!](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf) Page 4 btw. I should have linked this earlier tbh!

Thank you, but I was expecting a source for both the rape statistic and the contraceptive failure statistic, as the latter is far more common.

&gt;&gt; If you're torn about rape and broken condoms, what about when the contraception fails for other reasons?
&gt;
&gt;I am torn about that too, but I would have to lean towards keeping the baby even in events where preventative measures that were taken failed. I consider it human life (albeit in its most basic form)

Would you like others to force their beliefs on you? And expect you to forfeit your rights only because of their beliefs?

Also, there is quite a bit of hypocrisy in this, as 13% of women who have abortions were evangelical Christians. A group that is often the loudest protesters in the US. 24% were Catholics.

&gt;&gt; Additionally, there are groups whose goal is misleading women (and men) about sex.
&gt;
&gt;Really? I'd love to hear about this. It sounds pretty strange to me tbh

Abstinence only education is literally this. There are also fake abortion clinics that lie to women about the risks of abortion. The former is almost exclusively pushed by conservative politicians.

&gt;&gt; Abstinence only education is borderline criminal.
&gt;
&gt;I agree! People will always have sex, it is a part of human nature. To try and prevent that is ridiculous.

Abstinence itself can fail even if it is done ""perfectly"" if the person isn't educated as to how STDs are transmitted and how pregnancy happens. 

&gt;&gt; And we on this side of the debate value the right to self determination higher than the fetus. 
&gt;
&gt;Why is that? Could you please elaborate!  

A real human has more value than a potential human. And the human has rights. That's also ignoring the real life implications of unwanted pregnancy and the standard of living of the potential human who is not wanted, likely poor and likelier to fall into crime.

141,"Forcing men and women to deal with each other for 18 years to raise a child neither potentially wanted and would have aborted given the option, is detrimental for the child involved. How would you force men to stay and help raise a child? There’s already problems many women have getting support and help from fathers that wanted the child initially so suggesting to force men that have no interest in raising a child just isn’t feasible. Especially with the overwhelming conservative theme of pregnancy prevention being only the woman’s responsibility and it’s her punishment for having sex, but nothing is said about the men who help in creating the child. A child should not be a punishment. How is that view pro life? 

Birth control is not 100% effective in any form. Accidents happen. So you suggest punishing women with an unwanted child when they did everything they could to prevent it in the first place? I don’t know any woman that uses abortion as a form of birth control and the havoc it would have on a body would be crazy and unsustainable. It is a last resort, often times with the child’s best interest in mind. If a woman is struggling to pay bills and make ends meet or is single and has no wish to raise a child alone, bringing a child into the mix would be a huge burden on the mother all as punishment. But then conservatives tell women to just not have sex, but again nothing is said about the men also participating. 

The argument that making it illegal would make people think more on the consequences of sex is just bullshit. It was illegal and that didn’t stop women before. Just because something is illegal doesn’t mean people will stop, they will just find alternatives like unsafe and harmful abortions. Weed is illegal in most places and yet people still do it. Having abortion legal provides women with a clean and safe environment with trained professionals to perform the abortion instead of risking their own health and safety. 

I mean decent chance of survival being that a lot depends on the hospital and what their NICU can do. Most rural hospitals can not handle early term babies and would send mothers to larger hospitals to deal with preemies. Even then things could not go well, lungs can be too underdeveloped or other issues so while 25 weeks is considered viability for a fetus it is not always guaranteed. For me, it’s a big deal that the baby could live outside of the mothers body. It becomes more of a person as it has reached the point of being able to live outside the mother. Until then everything is dependent on the mother, it’s passed the point of being just a bundle of cells. All that said, I still think it’s wrong to impose your morals or beliefs on someone else. 

I think pro life people should focus more on lowering abortion rates through better sex education and easier access to birth control. Both of which have shown lower abortion rates. Simply saying don’t have sex hasn’t worked in the past and having abortion illegal also didn’t work, but states having actual sex education and easily available birth control has been proven to lower abortion rates. Also providing mothers with better support and less expensive prenatal care would help in curbing abortions and allowing the mothers to feel like they have more options than being poor and struggling with a child or an abortion.

144,"&gt; You are painfully ignorant of how easy it to get pregnant, despite using birth control. The failure rate of popular forms of birth control per year is 15% for condoms and 7% for the pill/patch.

I hear from other pro-choice people on this subreddit that it's 3% for condoms. Could you please clarify on the statistics with a source? That would be greatly appreciated!

&gt; Pro life Republicans also try to stop healthcare plans from covering birth control and certain groups are also trying to defund Planned Parenthood which does provide these things for free.

Even if they aren't free, condoms and the pill are fairly cheap and are not an economic burden to anyone.

&gt; I find this opinion morally reprehensible. People do not forfeit their right to self determination because they had sex.

It is not because they had sex that they lose this right, rather it is because they decided to get pregnant. Having sex is not the issue, the issue is not using birth control and then deciding to use abortion as a birth control (IMO)

&gt; I am struggling to find this article, as what I can see is a breakage rate higher than that abortion rate. The Guttmacher institute has a lot of info on their site.

I am torn about that too, but I would have to lean towards keeping the baby even in events where preventative measures that were taken failed. I consider it human life (albeit in its most basic form)

&gt; Additionally, there are groups whose goal is misleading women (and men) about sex.

145,"A. There is no data that suggests that less women would get pregnant if abortions were illegal, and I think that such an incredulous claim needs some kind of source from you.

B. Women pass fertilized eggs all the time without even realizing it. These fertilized eggs are not human beings. We pass them naturally, and it’s only considered an actual pregnancy once the egg attaches to the uterine wall. If abortions are immoral, you would also have to argue that women regularly murder helpless fertilized eggs through the natural processes of our body. One could even go as far as to say that ejaculating into a tissue is murder, as the sperm wasn’t used specifically to fertilize an egg, and thus has been a waste of a potential for life. See how ridiculous that sounds?

147,"&gt; I don’t feel that an accidental pregnancy is always due to “being irresponsible” as sometimes the father doesn’t want to be involved and being a single parent isn’t viable for a lot of people. There are also people who make a small mistake and don’t want to compromise their career or college due to an accidental pregnancy.

While I see one would want to abort the baby for the sake of their career, I would have to disagree that aborting a fetus for the sake on one's convenience is okay. Getting pregnant (or getting someone pregnant) is not a small mistake and most people today are well-informed of what could happen after having sex. It might be a small thing that causes the pregnancy, but the act in and of itself surely cannot be considered small by any means!

&gt; Also, no one is using abortion as their main method of birth control, I’ve seen this argument before and that’s a load of crap. It’s expensive, it’s inconvenient, it’s uncomfortable, and emotional. I’ve seen pro choice arguments that some women just go get an abortion 3 times a year instead of “being responsible” and I just can’t imagine anyone in their right mind chooses abortion as a primary birth control method.

If people are using other methods to prevent pregnancy, then that would imply that most women who get pregnancies today get it because they chose to not use a different form of birth control OR that their previous choice in birth control simply failed. For the latter, which you're saying is basically all abortions, then the question of whether or not this fetus is a human being comes into play. For the former, the fetus should certainly be born as the woman knew exactly how to prevent getting pregnant and chose otherwise.

&gt;  Not all birth control works for all women, and abortion is usually an absolute last resort when all else (birth control, condom, plan b pill) fails.

For cases like these where the woman took precautionary measures to prevent pregnancy, or where the woman never had any part in getting pregnant (like rape) it comes down to what you consider the ""ball of cells"" in the fetus to be. Why do you consider those ball of cells to not be human life?

&gt; History has proven both of those things to not be the case, a woman with an unwanted pregnancy will likely seek out an abortion whether it is legal or not. We might as well provide women a safe and clean clinic to have that procedure instead of forcing them to opt for unsafe back alley abortions.

If abortions are made illegal, it will reduce the number of pregnancies to almost nothing. Considering how we have other highly effective means of birth control, women with unwanted pregnancies will cease to exist. But for the fraction that do get pregnant knowing both how to prevent a pregnancy and that abortions are illegal, maybe they might seek out illegal unauthorized abortions. But the number, IMO, will be so minuscule to the point of irrelevancy.

I think an important question in moving this dialogue forward is this: Why don't you consider those ball of cells human life? Do you consider it a potential for life? What draws the line between a ball of cells and a human being?

148,"&gt; It takes two to make a baby and men should be responsible for protection also. I realize it’s more common for women to be on the pill or some other form of bc but men should also be responsible and wrap it up.

What would you say to forcing men to be there to provide for the families that they have accidentally created? It sounds extreme but it is an idea circulating among many conservatives in America today!

&gt; Abortion was made legal in the first place because women were trying to force a miscarriage by putting their bodies through crazy amounts of stress and drinking and eating crazy concoctions. Women were trying so hard to have miscarriages that they would harm themselves and often cause permanent damage and even death.

While this is true, we now have many advanced forms of pregnancy protection to prevent women from ever having to do such a thing like that!

&gt; Making abortions illegal wouldn’t stop abortions, it would only stop safe abortions. A fetus’ value should not be placed above that of the woman carrying it.

I actually think the opposite! If abortions are made illegal, I feel that more women and men would be conscious of the sexual decisions they make to prevent pregnancy at all as having an abortion is no longer an option.

&gt; ....it’s only going to hurt the child in the long run. Having a mother resent her child for possibly ruining her life, tying her to a man that may or may not also want a child, or possibly be given up and placed in foster care. It doesn’t make for a good environment for a child just so the mother is punished.

That is actually a really good point, babies that come out of these circumstances won't be raised in the best environments. However, this would then lead to whether or not aborting the fetus is murder (read further down this response)

&gt; Yes there’s condoms but they have a 97% success rate when used perfectly. Accidents happen and I have had guys flat out refuse to wear them....

If that is the case, then why do so many abortions occur? If condoms only have a 3% failure rate, then surely all abortions would be exclusive to women who are victims to defective means of preventing pregnancy as women wouldn't rely on abortions when having one night stands.

&gt; ....once a guy pulled it off sometime in the middle.

Isn't that some type of rape? (Assuming the woman was not informed of this)

&gt; I think abortions after 25 weeks should be for medical purposes only. At 25 weeks, a fetus has become viable and has a decent chance of living outside the mother. Before then, it can’t live without the mother and it should be the mothers choice to continue or not.

What do you mean by decent? Also, you're saying that the mother should be able to abort the fetus because she's the one keeping it alive, I'd like to know more about why you think its ability to live outside the mother is an acceptable criteria for whether or not it can be aborted.

149,"I see your point, I did assume that an abortion is wrong. I think a better way to phrase what I meant is that abortion is preventable. I think if someone is able to prevent needing an abortion in the first place, one should! Abortion, IMO, is not something that should be as relied on as a means of getting rid of the pregnancy in the first place if there are other easier preventative measures. Women shouldn’t want to have sex with the notion of getting an abortion in mind. 

As far as serious moral arguments go, I would say that the fetus is considered human life and that it would be unethical in simply getting rid of it. 

However, I still hold true to the fact that if it’s preventable it shouldn’t be happening at all. Economically speaking one could argue against abortion as it costs money to fund these clinics and to prevent pregnancies from occurring in the first place is a cheaper, more efficient alternative.",1,1511138274,2017-11-19 19:37:54
150,"&gt;So I believe that abortion, morally speaking, is wrong. My main argument for this is that pregnancies occur because women happened to have been irresponsible and have gotten pregnant. Since avoiding getting pregnant is so easy, why not just avoid getting pregnant as apposed to discarding what is in the woman's uterus? It costs $0 to not have sex and around $5 for condoms. Being on the pill is also an option.

Additionally, there are groups whose goal is misleading women (and men) about sex. Abstinence only education is borderline criminal.

&gt;While I consider that fetus living, I also recognize that this pregnancy was not the woman's responsibility in having at all. The conflict between the mother having nothing to do with getting pregnant and the value of that fetus make it hard for me to come to a clear conclusion. If I dearly had to pick whether or not abortions should be allowed in rape/defective condoms, most likely I would go with prohibiting abortions as life is still life, even if the mother was not responsible for it.

And we on this side of the debate value the right to self determination higher than the fetus.

&gt;More than anything, I want to see what pro-choice people have to say to my reasoning! Maybe I'll convince some people, maybe you'll convince me! Who knows?!

Unlikely to convince me. I'm not coming from a position based on religious dogma, despite having experienced said dogma in my younger years. I don't say this antagonistically, but realistically.

Why exactly?

You haven't actually made a moral argument supporting this position, you have just said in a some what circular fashion that the woman shouldn't have an abortion because she was irresponsible to have gotten pregnant and in need of an abortion. That argument assumes abortion is wrong from the start, otherwise there would be no issue with getting pregnant and needing an abortion. So it isn't a moral argument for why abortion is wrong.

Or to put it another way, assume from the start that abortion is 100% morally ok. A woman gets pregnant, and since in this hypothetical abortion isn't immoral it is not irresponsible of her to seek an abortion, it is in fact the responsible thing to do. She could have, maybe, avoided the abortion through some other method of birth control. But since abortion isn't immoral, that doesn't matter.

See the flaw? Your argument for why abortion is immoral only works if you start off assuming abortion is immoral. If you don't then none of the woman's actions are ""irresponsible"".",1,1511129154,2017-11-19 17:05:54

Avoiding getting pregnant is easy in theory, but birth control fails all the time. I personally feel like this argument only comes from people who have never actually had sex and experienced how avoiding pregnancy works. 
As a married, child-free woman, the argument to just ""not have sex"" is shit. Some women can't take the pill or use hormonal birth control. Some bodies reject the IUD. There is the rhythm method, but like I said, all forms can fail. 

I was able to get my tubes removed so after 6 years together my husband and I were finally able to stop using condoms, and I got my body back by getting off the pill.

I’m having an abortion, and I don’t feel that I deserve to be punished for being “irresponsible.” I met a woman once who conceived with her husband, and he died. She already had 3 children and couldn’t afford a 4th and wasn’t ready to go through a pregnancy while grieving the loss of her husband. She couldn’t afford to take care of 4 children without her husband, and she was blindsided by his death.

I think birth control options fail more than we think they do, and even if some people prefer not to use birth control that they shouldn’t have to bear the burden of pregnancy and parenthood if they don’t want to. At the beginning of a pregnancy we’re talking about a ball of cells, I think a lot of pro choice arguments run under the assumption that from the moment of conception a pregnancy is a person, and that is just not the case at all scientifically. I have a child and I’m not ready for another one, and I don’t feel that a ball of cells is more important than my bodily autonomy and right to choose.

History has proven both of those things to not be the case, a woman with an unwanted pregnancy will likely seek out an abortion whether it is legal or not. We might as well provide women a safe and clean clinic to have that procedure instead of forcing them to opt for unsafe back alley abortions. 

Sometimes I wonder what pro choice arguments and reproductive healthcare would look like  if men were primarily responsible for pregnancy and childbirth. Personally I feel like plan b pills and birth control pills should be readily available for anyone who needs them without having to make a doctors appointment. In some countries you can order birth control and plan b online, I wish the US would get with the times and offer these things more readily.

223,"&gt; I do not mean to sound arrogant or offensive, so I hope you don't take it that way

I think we're past that, SA, it's all good.

&gt; if you die we don't treat your body like a science experiment and mutilate it to test things(unless you gave consent before death for us to do so) we treat you like a human person because you're human, your humanity is/was intrinsically part of you.

I disagree that this is the reason that we don't do that.  I think that we engage in funerary rites and show respect for the bodies of the dead for the sake of other living humans.  I think it doesn't actually matter that the dead person was human -- we do (and through history, have done) the same thing for animals that we cared a lot about.  It's a ritual for the purpose of emotional processing.

And if it isn't somebody we care about (somebody destined for a pauper's grave, for example), we still do it because many of us would want our bodies treated the same way.

&gt;  I suppose a brain-dead person hooked up to a machine could be considered alive

You could absolutely *consider* them alive, and for some purposes that would be constructive.  I think that for the important purpose of ""do we care about keeping their body alive?"" the answer is no.  (We might care about it for other reasons, like helping their loved ones process grief, or preserving their organs for transplantation.)

&gt; It is our human-ness that matters. 

I disagree with you fundamentally on this one.  Not to get into science fiction, but if in tomorrow-land the dolphins/aliens/AI say, ""hello humans.  We want to gaze at the stars with you and wonder at the vastness of space.  We feel the small and fleeting nature of our existence in this universe.

&gt;The medical definition of death and the biological definition of life are not the same thing. The medical definition of death is fundamentally a practical one, basically serving as a clear-cut answer to the question of when you might as well give up trying to save someone's life.

In short I agree, but I'd like to add that you have indeed shifted my opinion on ""brain death"".

&gt; what if I ever fell pregnant to him and needed an abortion for whatever reason?

With these two data, I'd say it's not a dealbreaker (with the information I have available).  I know some great mixed-stance couples.  (Heterochoice?)

Now, I wouldn't date a prolife person because it'd be weird that they thought I was a murderer.

If you get a LARC until you're ready to have babies, have babies, then get sterilized, then this is unlikely to come up.

250,"Very briefly: Be pro-choice because consent - no one gets to live in and sustain themselves off of another person's body without that person's consent, which must be freely given and ongoing. 

Long answer:

I agree with you that a fetus at conception is alive, just like any other single-celled organism, and that it is human since it has human DNA. As a human, it has certain rights. However, that doesn't mean everyone always has to act in it's best interest. 

No one has the right to just go be inside your body - that's called assault, and we have a right to defend ourselves against assault. If the person with the uterus is ok with the fetus being there, then it's a consensual situation and everything is fine. But bodily autonomy says that the person with the uterus has the right to revoke consent to other people being in the uterus.

Let's take a crazy example: suppose some kind of mad scientist spliced their arteries to yours, and then cut their own heart out so that your heart is pumping for both of you. If you cut them off of you, they will surely die. Do you have a right to cut them off of you? Now suppose you agreed to this procedure in the first place, but afterwards you discover that this impedes your ability to work and so you can't afford food or housing, and that it's negatively impacting your body in ways you didn't imagine possible and you're experiencing severe discomfort and changes to your body which may not ever heal, and you can't go do the fun things with your friends that you used to because you feel sick and also you've got this mad scientist attached to you. I mean, you agreed to it in the first place, do you have a right to your own body now? Legally, it appears to me that you do have a right to your own body, even having consented to something in the past. For example, if you consent to sex, but then half way through decide you don't want to continue, then no one is legally allowed to force you to continue. 

Let's take a slightly more realistic situation. Suppose our medical technology advances a bit, and someone figures out how to implant a uterus holding a viable pregnancy in a male body (and knows how to complete a successful birth using a c-section). Suppose you're like, ""alright sure, I'll give it a try."" But then, some time later, you're experiencing all these different things - things no one told you would happen. Maybe the doctors even knew these things were possible, but didn't tell you because they didn't want to scare you. Should you be allowed to say ""Nevermind, take this thing out of me, I didn't understand that all these things would happen and I'm not down for it""?

Or, let's take a realistic example. Let's say you decide you want to try receiving anal sex. Let's say you find someone who wants to do that with you, and they tell you about every possible risk and warn you that it might be extremely uncomfortable or even painful. And let's say you're like, sure, do it. And so the two of you start to have anal sex. And let's say, part way through, you're like ""damn I really don't like this, this is fucking awful."" So you tell them to stop. Do they have the right to continue? After all, they warned you about all of the risks, and you still consented. 

I think you see my point: the issue is **ongoing** consent. No one gets to do things to your body if you aren't ok with it, even if you originally agreed, and even if you knew all the risks. Even though a fetus will die if it is removed from the uterus, it doesn't have the right to exist inside of a non-consenting person. That just isn't a right that we give to people, and good thing, because imagine the crazy situations we might get if we did give people that right.

None of this means that we should encourage women to have abortions. On the contrary, we should give them every opportunity to have their baby if they want. This means giving them adequate maternal leave, access to daycare and parenting resources and maternal healthcare, as well as (later) pediatric health care. It's not the case for every women, but most women have very strong hormones that really, really, really want a baby. Women are humans, and humans are organisms, and any organism's main goal is to reproduce. It's wired very strongly into our genes, and if you think about it, you come from an uninterrupted string of successfully reproducing ancestors tracing back to long before the human species even existed. (Most) women really want to reproduce. Women aren't out there having abortions just for funzies (for one thing, it's hella uncomfortable as well - ranging from ""just"" very painful to physically damaging). However, our hormones also tell us that if the living situation isn't safe, we are better off to wait until a better time to have a baby. If you make society a place where women feel comfortable and supported, you'll have a lot more success reducing abortions than if you ban them. ",1,1510696534,2017-11-14 16:55:34

Clumps are cells are alive. And human. Again, cancer, or any other cells in your body. 

The act of abortion is the removal of the fetus.. You take the pill, no one is stabbing it to death, it just falls out of your body but is premature and so dies since it no longer has life support. In some instances this is murder, like removing the breathing tube from someone and in others it isn't such as removing it from a brain dead individual. The only difference here is asking if you can morally force another individual to be chained to another as that life support. And be forced to undergo extremely invasive medical procedures to do such. 

Yes, it's a potential person but when is it's personhood worth the suffering of someone else. And I would call an unwanted pregnancy suffering.

Wow. Where do I even start with this comment.

So eagle eggs are not treated better than human fetuses, unless you ignore reality. If you kill a fetus inside a woman's body, you will be charged for murder which cannot be said tossing an egg. And there is no reason for an eagle to not decide to toss an egg out of the nest if that's what they want to do (usually they toss their offspring that can't hunt, but that's another story).

That's also ignoring the fact that eagle eggs and human fetuses are inherently different. If you take an eagle egg, remove it from its mother and basically shield it from the cold, you get an eagle. If you remove a human fetus from a woman's body, you get a miscarriage unless that fetus is beyond 24 weeks of gestation.

Only in a make belief world ""you can destroy a potential human in a hospital"" without consequence. The only abortion you can have is your own. It cannot be forced on someone else.

And the comment about the human that can pay taxes is an irrelevant point. Because it's not like you'll be protesting for the child to get taken care of by social programs or be looking out to help the parents in anyway. No, they should just handle the consequences of sex. This might not be your personal view, it's just the usual combination of beliefs in the US.

In summary, this straw man argument you have constructed is a poor one. A human fetus is valued far higher than an eagle egg. It's just that a woman's right to self determination (ie human right) is also highly valued.

333,"Gender doesn't. Age does. 


You are getting confused on my points, so let's put age and gender into separate boxes. 


Again, your argument that there is not a ""good reason"" for abortion in invalid. This is regardless of your age or gender. 


But on your point of logic:


Age: Absolutely has to do with logic when you're in your developmental years. Your brain isn't fully formed until your late teen years, and even then it continues to develop in your early 20s. This is not to say that there aren't rational teenagers; just that they are *less* rational than they would be at an older age. Once you're an adult, then it matters less, but as a teenager it absolutely plays a role in how you see the world, how you empathise, and how you construct your arguments.


Gender: nothing to do with logic, but everything to do with your claims on *this subject*. If I stroll onto a men's sub and start talking about what it's like to go through prostate cancer, they'd laugh me out of the sub. And before the ""did you just compare a fetus to cancer"", it's an analogy. I don't have the authority to talk about personal health related issues that only men have gone or will go through, and men do not have the agency to talk to me about personal health related issues that only I have gone or will go through. And whether you like it or not, until that baby exits the womb, it is a personal health issue for that woman, and you have no right to tell her how to handle it. 

Look up ""bodily autonomy"". Read through it and maybe you'll understand why, regardless of how you feel about fetuses, you *cannot* force someone to give up their wellbeing to support a pregnancy. 


Lastly, I don't want to discourage you from voicing your opinion, but it seems like you made this post moreso to be combative than out of curiosity. That's why you're getting personally insulted (although....if those are your ideas of ""insult"" you ain't gonna last very long on this website). When people see you're just projecting your opinion rather than wanting a discussion, they'll attack because it's not worth the effort to answer seriously.  Come at it with a more open mind and be willing to hear the other side, and you'll have your discussion. All I've seen you do on this thread is repeat your opinion like it's fact.

If you can understand why a woman would use contraception, then you can understand why a woman would want to have an abortion, even if you think preventing conception is morally permissible while abortion is not.  It's a good tool, I think, to make people start understanding women's motivations.  I've yet to hear someone call a woman on birth control selfish but hear it all the time about women having abortions, even though the motivation behind both actions is exactly the same.

That said, for the anti-abortion folks, they view themselves as ""a voice for the voiceless""- to them, lil' Jimmy as a zygote is a reality, unlike the mere potential lil' Jimmy represented by individual sperm and ova.

I was 22 years old when I got the news that rattled my world and ultimately changed the toxic life I was in. 

I was living with my boyfriend-at-the-time in a small apartment. I was a waitress at a small cafe and let's just say he went from one job to the next. We struggled to pay rent and feed ourselves every month. We struggled financially so much that one morning I awoke to my car being repossesed and towed right out of my driveway. I had to ride my bicycle to work 5 miles everyday because he did not allow me to use his car. 

 Believe it or not, at this time he and I had recently reconciled after a break up where we argued about infidelity and him wanting an open relationship and me wanting to be monogamous. After three months apart he came to me and said he would rather be together exclusively than not at all and I was naive enough to go back. It didn't take very long for me to start thinking I had made a mistake, but at that point I was trapped in this destructive world I had created for myself. 

 In the time we were apart, I was a patient in a high risk phsyc ward. I spent nearly 2 weeks locked away and isolated from society and then nearly 2 months in mandated intensive psychotherapy 5 days a week. I was a very young adult with extreme emotional damage just learning how to get by, recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and fed a buffet of pills (thanks to our broken pharmaceutical industry) in order to try and make the pain go away and feel ""normal"".  Well I took it too far and almost killed myself by taking far too many one night when I felt more hopeless than ever. And After all that, I still went back to him. I needed to feel like I wasn't alone, and I guess he was just as broken as I was. 

  Fast forward to the same day my car was towed away from our apartment, I had a doctors appointment. I had been nauseas and irritated for over a week but kept blaming it on the cocktail of antidepressants and antipsychotic I was taking daily. It was now time to really found out what was causing all the symptoms. He drove and dropped me off at the doctors, went home and waited for my call to come back. 

 I found out that I was nearly 8 weeks pregnant. A rush of emotions flew through me like I had never felt before. Part of me was elated, I've always wanted to have children, but like this? I was 22, actively using drugs, drinking and in an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship with someone who still acted like a kid himself, and with no interest of having one of their own. ""You're ruining my life if you have that thing"" he said to me. ""You're selfish, you're a narcissist."" I could go on, but I'll save you the trouble. 

  I didn't have a long time to decide what to do because of how far along I was when I found out. But experiencing the way my partner reacted to the news finally triggered something in me; that I wanted better, I needed better to have a child brought into this world. And not just for a child but for myself. I was raised without my father in the picture and it brought along a lot of pain early on in life. I knew that if I had this child, I would be alone. They would likely suffer with me. I had no car, little money, no support and no help. Not to mention the risks of pregnancy when drugs and alcohol are involved early on. I felt it would be selfish for me to bring a child into the world with such an unfair start at life.

I loved that little soul that was part of me don't get me wrong, it's a feeling like no other and I still hope to feel it again someday. But I ended my pregnancy, alone. I cried out in pain. I got violently sick and layed helplessly in my bathtub soaked with my own blood as it passed through me. 

Then my life went on though, I had another chance at everything but I was still financially tied to the toxic relationship I was in. He had stuck around since I got the abortion but something switched in me now and I resented him more than ever. I couldn't afford our apartment on my own and relied on him for transportation. I knew I wanted out but I had to plan it. I eventually found a room to rent walking distance from my job and was able to leave him for good and little by little, put the broken pieces of my life together. 

Im now 25, living medication free in a stable environment with a partner that I love and respect. You know what gave me the strength to do it all? That tiny soul who taught me how much better I could do for myself, and I truly believe our time together will come again, and I'll be ready. &lt;3",1,1509942565,2017-11-05 23:29:25

We can't start placing these kinds of restrictions on abortion. No one should be asking a woman why she is having an abortion to begin with, not even the woman's doctor.

As an example:

I think people should be allowed to euthanize their pets. It's often very difficult for the owner, but they're trying to save their pet from days or weeks of excruciating pain. Taking away this option would cause a lot of suffering for both pets and owners.

I also think it's wrong for someone to buy animals and euthanize them as entertainment. It's cruel and serves no purpose.

To your specific question, disallowing sex selective abortions would be effectively useless, because if someone wanted one they would just lie about it. You'd have to outlaw abortion, and likely any method of determination of sex before birth, if you wanted to try to accomplish that. Ultrasound machines would become illegal or at the very least strongly controlled, leading to completely unrelated health issues becoming harder to treat.

The choices are far too simplistic for the question you propose. There could be many, many more answers than the two you assume. There could be one set of possible answers for if we are discussing religious rights involved in the question. There could be an entirely different set of answers if we discuss the sexism involved in the question. There could be an entirely different set of answers if we discuss issues of bodily autonomy in the question.

Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human chattel enslavement, primarily of Africans and African Americans, that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries after it gained independence and before the end of the American Civil War. Slavery had been practiced in British America from early colonial days, and was legal in all Thirteen Colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

By the time of the American Revolution (1775–1783), the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry. When the United States Constitution was ratified (1789), a relatively small number of free people of color were among the voting citizens (male property owners).

This interacts with my views on abortion rights, feminism, and religion.

First, as a pro-choice person, I feel like if somebody is pregnant doesn't want to be, I am not going to require them to continue the pregnancy.  I can talk to them about all of the medical reasons, but the expert on them is... them.  It's not my role to judge anybody's reason.

Second, as a feminist, I totally judge their reason.  I think every family should be as glad to have a daughter as they are to have a son.  But I'm not going to require any woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy for that reason.  Fixing this issue involves fixing gender inequality, not forcing pregnancies.

Finally, regarding religion... religions find a way to allow the powerful what they want.  I think that these examples might demonstrate that such religions are more concerned with enforcing power structures than having a consistent ethical teaching.",1,1509838546,2017-11-04 19:35:46

Nazi eugenics were Nazi Germany's racially based social policies that placed the biological improvement of the Aryan race or Germanic ""Übermenschen"" master race through eugenics at the center of Nazi ideology.

Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the United States (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under Adolf Hitler's leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement Nazi racial policies.

[That may be true](http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full).

&gt; The parents who ultimately decide if they want the kid or not, make that choice under extreme distress and pressure. The weigh the options and figure it is best to not bring the kid into the world. By people forcing them to have the kid, you may subject them to a life of poverty, maybe the girl is living in a neighborhood that is sketchy and she is forced to bring a baby into that life. 

I was raised in poverty and sexually and physically abused as a child. I'm empathetic. I got married and had three children in my 20s. We didn't have a lot of money or opportunities, but we did what we felt was right and didn't kill anyone. We're in our 40s now and life is good.

17,"&gt;And you are putting words in my mouth. I never said it wasn't killing. Obviously there is a death involved and that death is a result of the procedure. This debate is about whether or not it is murder.

So we agree it is killing. Murder is just a legal term so there is no debate there. It is murder in some countries and not murder in others. And it murder depending on the stage of development of the baby in some places and not in others. 

&gt;If in any other situation someone tried to use my organs against my will, I would be allowed to defend myself. Why not in this situation too?

Well they aren’t trying to use them. It’s more like conjoined twins or breastfeeding a baby. Or even getting up in the middle of the night to make a bottle of milk for your newborn. No one is trying to use anything. You just got to take responsibility and do it. And we can’t kill in any of the above situations either.

&gt;And taking care of a born person (i.e. Driving to a fire station) is not even close to comparable to pregnancy but you keep arguing it is, which is just nonsensical.

You keep saying it’s not comparable but provide no evidence.

&gt;But I keep trying to help you understand the difference (when this topic too has been done to death). 

I haven’t heard one argument concerning this yet from you.  
&gt;Yet you won't help me understand why you see a difference 
between forced organ donation and forced birth?

Forced organ donation would force you to ACT to save a stranger. Illegal abortion would force inaction by not allowing you to kill or harm your child. Do you honestly not see the difference between the law saying, you can not kill a baby but, you still do not have to give him a blood transfusion?  

&gt;I'm not saying there is a difference to the moral worth of a fetus and a born person. I'm saying the moral worth doesn't matter because you are allowed to make medical decisions about who can use your organs.

In most cases, you’ve already made that decision once the baby is there. Once you donate organs, you can not just decide to tear the patient open again and take them back. That action would be more liken to abortion.

That 5 year old has a 25 percent chance of ""murdering"" somoene and a high chance of replicating similar people who will ""murder"".

There is a higher chance birth will lead to more abortions. 
It is an unstable time bomb.

It is not okay to kill 5 year olds because they have a very small chance of murdering somoene and their death will cause more harm for their parents. If the 5 year old has a 25 percent chance of murdering somoene, 90 percent chance of getting 1-2 children it would be neccesary for harm reduction to kill him or her.

People don't mourn over an abortion the same way as  5 year old. The parents has invested more time with the 5 year old and built a relationship. If the 5 year old has siblings they will get devestated. I also think some pro-lifers think that the fetus don't feel as much pain as a 5 year because the development of the nervous system is not done yet. I don't think people will mourn over aborted siblings so much because a part of this is just the parents feeling sad for not getting kids.

30,"I'm not particularly Christian. I'm a neopagan (for now - I'm having a bit of a crisis of faith that I sort of have to deal with alone right now). I quoted that one bible verse because it's one people throw at me quite often.

As for downvoting: Yes, a lot of feminists frequent 2XC (I'm one of them), and of course they'll downvote the crap out of a pro-life thread, but not everything is ""pro-life versus pro-choice"" in that arena. You can engage with other issues (like the experience of being a woman, any issues you have with sexual harassment, period horror stories, and fashion exchanges) without having to get into that discussion with anyone. The abortion issue is an important one, but sometimes it's important to take a break from politics in order to take care of ourselves. 

It's also quite clear that you can be cordial to a pro-choice person if that person attempts to be cordial with you, so it may still benefit you to comment on that sub. Just... try not to take any angry people to heart. Some of us are feminists because we've suffered a lot, and many feminists hold pro-life views (though they don't discuss them in feminist circles for fear of being, well, angrily confronted about them). 

Also, many of the subs recommended in the ""for women"" sidebar are in fact not feminist subs. The subs I recommend aren't politically-aligned at all, to the best of my knowledge.

Here's a list of some that helped me through my miscarriages, though I very rarely participated in discussions (it was a pretty difficult time for me, as you might imagine).

/r/ttcafterloss 

Also known as Trying To Conceive After Loss. You don't have to necessarily want to try RIGHT NOW, but it's helpful to talk to other people who have suffered a pregnancy loss and are also trying to conceive. I actually participated in this sub with a throwaway when I was trying to decide whether or not I wanted to get sterilized after putting my baby up for adoption.

/r/miscarriage ...umm, obvious. 

This was the sub I frequented the most after my last miscarriage. The community here is totally focused on supporting women through the struggles of miscarriage. Many of them share your pro-life views, but those that don't also aren't allowed to post anything unsupportive. It's very heavily modded. 

/r/babyloss 

I frequented this sub as well, since one of my miscarriages occurred at 13 weeks and was very traumatic for me.

/r/cautiousBB 

If you ever decide you want to try again.

/r/infertility 

If your miscarriage was caused by a medical issue, like mine were. (I don't know your life, so I thought I'd plug this sub - they were incredibly supportive of me when I discovered the fact that I was infertile. Again, though, I posted in this sub using a throwaway account.)

/r/adoption 

If you ever decide you want to forego pregnancy altogether and adopt out (or find that you can't get pregnant without great difficulty - again, something that I've had to come to realize).

I think as far as my feminist views go: I can care about you, help you get connected to some kind of emotional support during this difficult time, and simultaneously disagree with you. This is an emotionally-wrought issue for a lot of people, and I feel that if we can just acknowledge that and try to work with our common ground rather than attack one another for our well-reasoned emotional conclusions, we can make our world a better place.",1,1505879206,2017-09-19 23:46:46

32,"I'll admit now, yes, that first scenario is flawed if someone didn't have comp. The scenario will work if 1) you actually have your own property/injury coverage or 2) in a different wreck when you're at fault where you caused property damage and/or bodily injury to another person. You'd think having liability insurance would be better than pulling everything out of pocket up front (as well as added protection of legal fees in some policies), but then we have that idea of using other people's money again, which is the main idea. 

Let's hope you're a perfect driver, and never accidentally hit or injure anyone, ever. And hope you have enough cash on hand to be responsible for the result of your actions by engaging in risky behavior. Isn't that the point of your 100% your choices, 100% your responsibility comments, or am I missing something? ",1,1505875749,2017-09-19 22:49:09

35,"&gt;that's called liability coverage.

Yes, and in every state except NH, when you get insurance you are required to have at least $5k property liability damage and at least $15k bodily damage liability coverage (can be per person too). Why not pay for it 100% up front, have your wages garnished, etc, to pay for it instead of using other people's premiums to help you out if you're so dead set on 100% responsibility for your choices and actions.

39,"You're missing the point. You say you're 100% responsible for your choices, and why should others pay for it? If you get into an at-fault wreck, pay for the repairs upfront yourself, don't get insurance where you'll be using Larry and Bob's money to help repair your car. They had nothing to do with it - doesn't matter if they enrolled themselves into insurance. 
Taking responsibility for your choices means paying upfront for services rendered. Any damage from driving lawfully incurred to *your* property at your fault must be eaten by *you* - 100%. Why are you driving and engaging in risky behavior if you don't have enough money to protect yourself with 100% your own money?

No, that's hyperbole. You earned money by willingly participating in the economic system, you are voluntarily engaging a contract between the state. No once is forcing you to work. As an adult, each day you choose to remain a citizen is another day you agree to the governmental contract. Besides, you get to decide what taxes to pay by engaging your representation in the government. Enough people decided that they didn't want their tax dollars going to fund abortion, so that's why we have the Hyde Amendment today.

44,"It's hard to debate when you seem to be putting words in my mouth and want me to accept your claims without any logical argumentation.

Let's take this fire station thing as an example. Have I ever talked about driving to a fire station? 

Here is the thing, and I mentioned it in my last response, I don't see the moral difference between inside and outside my body. I also do not view pregnancy as torture. That's just pure fear-mongering. In fact, I think caring for a newborn can come closer to feeling like torture at times.

And you are killing it. Not only does an abortion kill the baby before extracting it, even if it didn't in any other case where a parent  knowingly places a child in a situation that is not conducive to their survival (ex: I throw a baby in a pool and they drown, I toss a child off a cliff and the impact kills them, I leave my newborn out in the winter storm and she freezes to death) and the child dies, they would be criminal charged with murder. If you can't concede that its killing then this is pointless.

Organ donation is not analogous because the law rarely requires us to act in order to save another person (except in duty of care situations like parental responsibility) but, it always obliges inaction when it comes to harming or killing another person.  ",1,1505793392,2017-09-18 23:56:32
45,"And taking care of a born person (i.e. Driving to a fire station) is not even close to comparable to pregnancy but you keep arguing it is, which is just nonsensical. But I keep trying to help you understand the difference (when this topic too has been done to death). Yet you won't help me understand why you see a difference between forced organ donation and forced birth?

I'm not saying there is a difference to the moral worth of a fetus and a born person. I'm saying the moral worth doesn't matter because you are allowed to make medical decisions about who can use your organs. ",1,1505792418,2017-09-18 23:40:18
46,"I don't think this debate is really about theology or religion. For me it's about human rights. If you are a living, human organism you are equal and worthy of the same rights. Any other line is arbitrary and subjective and I don’t feel comfortable leaving human rights to the whimsy of society. We’ve seen what injustices have been perpetrated in the past on human beings who were  declared less than human and non persons (ex: Jews, women and African Americans). I don’t see the way we are treating human fetuses or preborn children now as any different.

Biology is a concrete and objective measure by which we can set a standard. Personhood is a philosophical concept that can be changed and created subjectively. And the times in the past that we have chosen to eliminate members of our human family from the term personhood, it has always been so that we can commit atrocious human rights violations against them (slavery, holocaust, genocide). 

I am sorry you had such a horrid experience growing up. No one should have to go through what you went through. I wish I knew you then. I would have tried to help you. As a side note though, I don’t think it is fair to call a child unwanted. They may be unwanted by their parents but, there are many, many couples waiting to adopt. And again, since I believe that a fetus is a human person with equal rights, being unwanted would still not be justification for killing. We would never kill a born child (an orphan for example) as a solution to their lack of wantedness by their parents so why would we in the case of abortion?

Thanks for the suggestion that I get help after my miscarriage. I don’t mind at all. I can see you are looking out for my best interest in this case. It wasn’t a recent loss. I have had two children since then and although the loss impacted me greatly, my prolife activism stems from the inability to reason myself to any other position. 

To me it seems that in order to be prochoice you either have to be logically inconsistent or accept atrocious consequences and I am not willing to do either.

As for /r/twoxchromosomes, in my experience they are completely unwelcoming to anyone with a prolife view. You get downvoted to oblivion and then can’t respond so it’s pretty useless.   

I don’t know much about the bible but the quote you added to your response earlier made me think that you are Christian and so I did do a bit of searching. It seems to me like the bible is very prolife and clearly values human fetuses/preborn child as equal to any other human at any other stage of development. Here are a few quotes I found, 

1.“Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17)

2. ""He had set me apart before I was born...and had called me through His grace."" (Galatians 1:15)

3. ""Thou shalt not kill.""(Exodus 20:13)

4. ""The Lord hates hands that shed innocent blood."" (Proverbs 6:16-17)

5. “Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.” (Genesis 16:11)

6. “In the womb he supplanted his brother, and as a man he contended with God.” (Hosea 12:3)

7. “But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father. For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (Romans 9:10-11)

8. “Truly children are a gift from the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward” (Psalm 127:3)

9. “You knit me in my mother’s womb . . . nor was my frame unknown to you when I was made in secret” (Psalm 139:13,15)

10. “You have been my guide since I was first formed . . . from my mother’s womb you are my God” (Psalm 22:10-11).

11. “God… from my mother’s womb had set me apart and called me through his grace” (St. Paul to the Galatians 1:15)

I never really read the bible much though and as noted early I really think this issue is about human rights and religion plays little to no role in it. But that’s just me. Religion may be really important to you and I in no way am trying to disrespect that.

Sorry for the long text. I really appreciated having this conversation with you. Thank you for your candidness and openness to discussion.

Think of it like this - im not killing anything. Im removing it from my body. It's an unfortunate side effect that it can't survive outside my body. That doesn't mean I don't get to choose if it can be inside my body.

52,"I believe fetuses are people at a certain point before the pregnancy ends. If we wanted to get into theology, I think it isn't unreasonable to assume that a fetus gets a soul and becomes a person after, say, 20 weeks, when all the nervous system functions are at least somewhat operational.

""I knew you from the womb"" could mean many things.

I'd say most women agree with me. Women overwhelmingly get abortions before the 20 week mark - in fact in my state it's illegal to get an abortion after that gestational period. Of those who opt to get abortions after that period, I believe I read somewhere that 80-95% of them do so because the fetus isn't viable (and so giving birth would be cruel and painful for everyone) or because there's a very high level of risk to the mother's life.

Conception gives the fetus the potential to be a person. I treated mine like people, even though in my case only one made it that far. But given those parameters - full nervous system, response to external stimuli - I'd say it's unreasonable to define personhood based on conception alone, even if that is my personal definition.

Given that, I think it's reasonable to say that preventing that fetus from becoming a person may well be something that prevents that person from experiencing the horrible pain of knowing they're unwanted. 

Is abuse worse than death? No. I was abused. I made it. I'm glad I'm alive. I was, however, very lucky, because most young children who suffer the level of abuse and neglect that I suffered do not survive to adulthood. My mother should have never been allowed to be a parent, because she is a terrible one.

So I guess my point is that given all that, it's not fair to tell a woman who is unprepared to give birth that she has to do so, given the fact that we can't agree upon what truly constitutes a person. ",1,1505747792,2017-09-18 11:16:32
53,"You haven’t made a point. You stated an opinion. It’s kind of hard to not get hung up on words when they are the mechanism by which any explanation comes.

And no, I do not think that parental responsibility is any morally different before or after birth. The burden of proof rests on you here.

Lastly, there is no such thing as forced birth (unless a person is being forcibly induced). Not being allowed to kill another person in order to avoid an involuntary occurring phenomena is not force.

54,"I hope your daughter does not have to suffer that pain as well. As a mom myself I have come to learn though that there will no doubt be some kind of pain that a person must endure. It is not completely avoidable. Of course, there are certain pains that we all know and feel no one should have to go through. But in my experience many of the people that do go through that suffering somehow end up being stronger despite it. Imo, you gave your daughter the best gift, life. Opportunity. Potential. Only a mom can give that.   ",1,1505712463,2017-09-18 01:27:43
55,"I really think the disconnect here is that I believe a fetus is a human person and is equal to and worthy of the same rights as any other person. That being said, I think that the perpetrators of abuse are responsible for their deplorable actions not the lack of abortion. I wish they had put up their child for adoption like you. 

Is abuse worse than death? Who can answer that? I mean I'd probably choose the former because at least that would give me a chance. With death there is no going back, no chance at all. But a fetus/preborn child doesn't get to choose between the two and that is part of the problem. Is death at 1 day old worse than death at 2 years old? I really do not know. Although I am inclined to think they are equal tragedies.

What I do know is that we would never give permission to an abusive parent of a born child the right to kill their baby because of the possible resentment and abuse they may inflict on them in the future. So why would we in the case of abortion? We would try to get that baby out of the situation. So why not do the same in the case of abortion?

I try to advocate largely for things like better access to adoption, social services, health care, pregnancy/maternity leave etc. in hopes that these things will help people in difficult situations and out of difficult situations. I have also housed women with unplanned pregnancies. I try to help them as best I can. 

I think and hope that at least we can agree that the latter things (social services, maternal/pregnancy leave, universal health care etc.) are necessary components to helping mothers and their unborn babies. So, at least we may have found a bit of common ground. Which is not bad considering the level of emotion involved in this type of discussion.

56,"I think that's a complicated issue. 

I understand the grief bit. I've had a few miscarriages because I have a genetic disorder that prevents proper fetal development over the first eight weeks. It's absolutely brutal, and it can make you feel disconnected with your body and everyone around you. 

That being said: I don't want to use my grief to further human suffering, and I've seen firsthand what an unplanned baby can do to a woman's life. I really do feel that a lot of the most horrible crimes committed against children could have been prevented if the parents had not forced themselves to become parents too soon. 

Which begs the question: is abortion really worse than what happened to Casey Anthony's daughter? Is it worse than child rape? Drug addiction? Horrifying child abuse perpetuated by a parent who resents their child's existence? I'd much rather see a young woman get an abortion in the first trimester (which is when almost all abortions happen) than see her young child get abused by a resentful partner years later. 

Edit: I completely understand why you feel the way you feel. I don't want to imply that I don't. Losing a wanted pregnancy is one of the most heart wrenching things imaginable, and many women see all these women taking that for granted. It's definitely murkier for you than it would be for me, since I have never had a wanted pregnancy to lose. 

(Sidenote: I am a broken condom baby, and let's just say that the whole ""antithesis of maternal affection"" thing is passed on genetically in my family. There's probably a corpse somewhere in Germany of a 9000 year old woman who looked at her baby and wondered which end the nipple went in, and that woman somehow managed to raise a dysfunctional baby to adulthood in order to create my line.)",1,1505704158,2017-09-17 23:09:18

I lost a baby at 12 weeks through miscarriage and I don't think anyone will ever convince me that a fetus is not a human person with rights. I don't believe that a parent's feelings for their child is what gives him or her worth. They have intrinsic value.

59,"My story is pretty simple: My boyfriend and I got pregnant early in the relationship five years ago. I chose adoption instead of abortion or raising the baby for a variety of reasons. I'm fairly spiritual, if not traditionally religious, so I believed it was the right (if difficult) thing to do, but I'm also just... the antithesis of what motherhood should be.  

I had to have a c-section due to a variety of factors. Unfortunately the incision didn't heal properly, so now I can't bend my torso without experiencing a great deal of pain. (I should remind you that it's been five years, so it's not like I haven't had time for the incision to heal.) I also experienced lots of postpartum depression, I couldn't have sex for the better part of a year without even more pain, and my entire family basically washed their hands of me because they disagreed with the decision. Most wanted me to keep the baby.

My boyfriend stood by me through it, but it wasn't easy. We almost broke up over it a number of times. We're happier than we've been, and it's getting better, but for the most part we're still together because we trauma-bonded, not because we would have necessarily stayed the course. We're incompatible on a number of levels.

My daughter doesn't even know who I am because being near her hurts me on an emotional level I can't ever explain to someone who hasn't felt it. I ultimately burned out of teaching a lot faster because I became envious of the parents who got to stay with their kids and didn't have to sacrifice anything. I'm happy now, but that happiness was hard won, and it's nothing compared to the envy I once felt towards parents who had everything I simultaneously wanted and feared.

I wouldn't say I **regret** it, but sometimes I wonder how things would have worked out if I'd decided to get an abortion and move on with my life. Would I still be teaching? Would I have become a software engineer? Would I still be with my boyfriend? Would my life have been easier than it turned out? 

Maybe it would have been, but I think that can be said of someone who, say, decides to donate a kidney to someone they love. I can't explain it, but I knew I loved my daughter the moment I realized I was pregnant (which was, of course, weeks before getting a confirmation). I think it was in part due to the fact that I was in the process of falling in love with my boyfriend, so my love for the fetus got wrapped up in all that limerent obsession.
I don't know how I'd have felt if I didn't love the fetus (which became my daughter). I don't expect other women to feel the same because they aren't me.

A woman who doesn't feel that love for their incubating fetus shouldn't have to donate their uterus to that fetus for nine months. It's difficult in a way that no one but a woman who has had and then subsequently given up a baby can ever explain.

And that is commendable. As a woman and mother I get that being pregnant is not easy and neither is the idea of possibly raising a child you are not ready for.

First, an abortion kills the fetus it does not merely move him or her to another location.

Second, knowingly  moving a child to a location that is not conducive to his or her survival is a criminal offense and if the child dies the person responsible would be charged with murder (i.e. I toss a child into water and leave him to drown, I throw a kid off a cliff and the impact kills her, I find a baby on my boat and I drop him or her overboard and they asphyxiate, the father in the remote cabin in the woods leaves his daughter out in the snow and she freezes to death).

Third, the law never requires that we act to save someone’s life (unless we are in a duty of care situation which a parent is) but always requires that we NOT act (inaction) in a way that directly harms or kills another human being. 

Fourth, the child’s bodily autonomy would be violated by abortion. If you think that the fetus loses their right to autonomy because of the possible harm to the mother then refer back to my example about the person with the flu. 

A passenger finds themselves stuck on an airplane with an elderly man with the flu. The flu is much more likely to cause death and complications than pregnancy. Obviously the passenger can not kill the elderly man. So how is this scenario morally different than abortion?

This also occurs in conversations about sexual assault - but maybe you aren't in the right circles for that. 

As for your second point, I don't see how they aren't analogous. In fact, the examples I gave make the abortion issue even more absurd. 

A corpse doesn't need their organs. They're dead. Removing a dead person's kidney has no impact on their quality of life. 

Even so, we don't just steal kidneys from random corpses. We use kidneys provided by people who registered as organ donors before their deaths. The person in this scenario has the freedom to revoke their registration at any time by going to the DMV. 

But what about the millions people who die of treatable illnesses because they sat on donor lists for too long? They're people, they're very obviously sentient, and they're in demonstrable pain. Don't they deserve the right to live? Don't they deserve a good quality of life?

Yes, of course they do. No one is arguing that they don't deserve those things. It's just, we as a society have also decided that the organ donor also deserves the right to medical bodily autonomy. Even though the person is dead, even though they aren't really people anymore, and even though they'll never have need of that organ anymore, their bodily autonomy supersedes the dying person's right to live.

We don't call people murderers for refusing to donate a kidney. That's absurd. So why are we calling women murderers for refusing to permanently change their bodies to house a cluster of cells that may or may not be a person? Why does the fetus's personhood matter more than the mother's? Why does a corpse get rights that a pregnant woman doesn't have?

Is it because you believe she assumed responsibility for that when she decided to have sex? Because I understand that, but you have to understand that the situation is far more complex than that. Unwanted children often grow up in poverty and suffer myriad health issues as a result of negligent parents. An unplanned pregnancy can significantly and permanently impact a young woman's life, as well as the life of her child, by continuing and perpetuating a cycle of poverty that becomes difficult to break. 

And people are going to have sex. That is a fact of life. 

What I don't understand is why pro-life people don't donate more to contraception outreach programs that target low-income women instead of trying to defund them. If you truly believed that abortion was murder, you'd work to try and stop it from being an issue in the first place... But you don't, which perplexes me.

My speculation is that you feel women should be punished for having sex, which I could maybe agree-to-disagree on if not for the fact that it literally harms children. ",1,1505528415,2017-09-15 22:20:15

119,"**Why we shouldn't make laws about it**

I would think that all women, pro-lifers and pro-choicers would agree we don't want the government to decide when we can or can't have abortions.  Right now the government culture is very pro-fetus, and people are letting the government write laws over the objections of science and medical professionals.  Bad idea.  What happens if in 40 years the zika outbreak causes tons of birth defects and it's been enshrined into law that the gov't can decide when a life is viable?  There's a long history of forced sterilizations in this country, it's really quite a small leap to forced abortions.  I can easily envision a world where the US gov't forces poor women with babies with birth defects to terminate.  Get politicians OUT of this decision either way. 

**Religious Logic: Why it's totally stupid to assume a ""soul"" happens at conception** 

There is a 22-75% chance that a fertilized egg fails to implant.  So, up to 75% of pregnancies end in miscarriage in the first few weeks.  At 5 weeks pregnant, there's a 10% chance of miscarriage.  From there it continues to go down week by week.  But let's take a conservative view and say that 1 in 3 pregnancies end through miscarriage.

Are you saying that 1 out of every 3 souls ever created never made it out of the womb?  That seems like a stupid design flaw.  If you want to talk souls, it's probably much more likely it develops over time (much like a human fetus).  Furthermore, Catholic dogma used to hold that a soul didn't develop until something like 4 months into the pregnancy for men and 6 months in for women.  So, the idea that we can just keep pushing back the ""start date"" of the soul every time we have some new scientific knowledge while ignoring how common miscarriages are is foolish.

Certainly, anyone who isn't constantly mourning for the billions of miscarried souls can't really argue that abortion up to 6 weeks means jack-shit in regards to a soul. 

**Politicized Fetus**

First off, abortion has always existed in different cultures throughout all of history.  And, frankly, before quickening (feeling a baby move inside the womb) it was never really considered abortion, just considered restarting menses.  As medicine got a little better at figuring out when someone was pregnant, certain attitudes came along with that frankly had a lot more to do with controlling women and the birth rate than protecting babies.  Even after RvW, you don't actually see an Evangelical backlash against abortion until the 80s Jerry Falwell up and decided there should be some politicizing issue to unite them and landed on abortion.  You can read about this, and it's actually pretty fascinating. 

You also need to understand the importance of the ultrasound image in this politicization of abortion.  Prior to the 1960s we didn't have a way to really image fetuses.  If you want to talk about pregnancy, you need to really include the mother in this conversation.  Enter the ultrasound image.  Now you can take a picture of a free-floating fetus that literally renders the woman invisible.  Now you can add some modicum of *science* to the idea that this fetus has autonomy.  The fetus is viewed on its own, floating there, very human-like and the woman is not a part of the picture at all.  That's fucked up.  Because that fetus isn't a free-floating baby, it's a fetus that is 100% dependent on the woman for survival.  There is no autonomy and it's absurd and disingenuous to talk about fetus and woman as separate entities.  They aren't, they can't be, not until much later in the pregnancy. 

**Autonomy** 

These questions are complicated.  But at the end of the day, the fetus needs the woman's body to develop into a baby.  The woman gets to decide what to do with her body.  For the same reason we can't just harvest bone marrow from living people without their consent, even though it will save a life, you can't just make a woman stay pregnant.  We don't even take organs from dead people if they haven't consented to it.  So as a culture we literally give dead people more rights than we give pregnant women. ",1,1505500734,2017-09-15 14:38:54
120,"Um... No. Medical bodily autonomy is not a new thing. It's literally as old as necrophilia laws.

Medical bodily autonomy means that someone doesn't get to take your kidney without your consent, even if your kidney is the only match in the world, you could survive using your other kidney, and they would die without it. (This, coincidentally, is the entire plot of *My Sister's Keeper* by Jodi Picoult - the protagonist sued because she knew a court would rule in her favor, since bodily autonomy laws were well-established by then.)

It makes it illegal for people to donate your body to any cause without your consent. (That's also why you have to register as an organ donor if you want to donate your organs after you die.) 

It makes it illegal for people to fuck your body after you die.

Come on now that is pure anti science.

Well the fetus is not a mosquito. The fetus is in fact a human being. Just like you are a human being. And you both deserve human rights. I mentioned that the fetus possesses more than 90% of the structures found in adults at 8 weeks and asked what an adult has that makes them more worthy of human rights? You evaded the question. Interesting note, the fetus has it's own blood type and his/her dna is compromised of different dna than it's mother.

&gt;But it's more important to you, than me. A full grown woman. 

I value all human beings equally. Size does not determine a person's worth. If it did I would put my 6 year old's needs before my 2 year old's. It makes no logical sense.

161,"&gt; I am capable of surviving on my own, I am not a parasite.

When my daughter was born she couldn't survive on her own. She needed to be hooked out to life support. She wasn't a parasite then and she is not one now. Being dependent (like a conjoined twin) doesn't make you a parasite. Sounds like something people need to tell themselves to justify killing or other atrocious behaviour.
  
&gt;If something is attached to me, surviving from my energy, I have the right to get rid of it if I want. 

Not really. It is only the case (legally) with abortion and it is only the case in some countries. Many countries respect the right to life of the preborn child. And again, conjoined twins are attached. Morally it is always wrong to kill another human being as a solution to a problem (exception self defense).

&gt;You are HIGHLY downplaying what pregnancy is and it's quite manipulative. Pregnancy is actually very painful, many women have their ribs break, and their vagina torn to their anus. You are sick and exhausted for 9 months straight. 

I've been pregnant more than once. And I've given birth. I think someone fear mongered you into thinking pregnancy is the worst thing in the world. And yes, I had vaginal tearing twice. I get it. It can be difficult. But in all honesty it is not that bad. And death is a much, much greater price to play. I can not imagine any sane person choosing death over 9 months of pregnancy.

&gt;I'm not willing to do that for a baby that I do not want. I'm not interested in pro life anything, pro choice is compassionate to people who are ALREADY ALIVE AND SURVIVING ON THEIR OWN MERITS.

Unfortunately I don't think prochoice is very compassionate at all. They offer a band aid solution to a greater problem. Also, being alive and surviving on your own merit are two different things. You can be very much alive but still depend on others or other things (conjoined twins and life support patient were two examples I provided earlier). In reality, no one can survive independently of others. We need eachother to survive.

&gt;That's what I'll always choose. Thanks, but no thanks at all. 

As you grow older you might realize that things are not so black and white. That most people are trying to do their best and perhaps you will be more open to hearing views that differ from your own.

Abortion is not always the easy route it is made out to be. Not only does a baby die but the mother (and father) can also suffer. I only tell you this because I know many woman who are very close to me (mother, sister, best friend etc.) who've had abortions for various reasons and suffered greatly after (physically, emotionally and mentally). One experienced a severe hemorrhage and almost bled to death, another has carried the regret and still others struggled with post abortion trauma.

You don’t have to be religious or believe in souls to be prolife. See [here(http://www.secularprolife.org/abortion). Many people on the prolife subreddit are atheist as well. 
You don’t need to be religious to know abortion is wrong. Just like you don’t need to be religious to know killing a born baby is wrong.

&gt;I believe in science, so this fetus to me is just a clump of cells. It isn't a person, it isn't a child. 

We are all just a clump of cells though. Whether the fetus is a human being is an issue that biology has already solved. See [here](http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_illustrated.php). 
The issue of personhood is a philosophical one. Prolifers believe that all human beings are equal and ought to have the same basic human rights.

&gt;That's where pro life and pro choice will never EVER see eye to eye. I am a human, I am a person. I am more important than a clump of cells. 

Well I think all prolifers would agree that you are a human and that you are a person. But biologically speaking you are also just a clump of cells. I mean at 8 weeks the human fetus possesses more than 90% of the structures found in adults. See [here](http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_illustrated.php?page=9). I think the question most prolifers would have is what you (or an adult) has that the 8 week embryo does not that makes you more worthy of human rights in your opinion?

&gt;Idgaf if anyone wants this baby, I don't. So I won't carry it to term because it's my body and I get to decide what uses my body to live.

Well, my point was that the baby is not unwanted. There are many who would want him or her. 

Part of of what we are discussing is your body true. But abortion is about whether or not we have a right to kill someone else’s body simply because they are attached to us. I mean one conjoined twin can not just kill the other right so, I think the answer is definitely not on demand and without apology.

When I was younger I bought into the prochoice rhetoric too. When I got older I thought logically about it more. When I was pregnant I couldn’t deny that there was a baby growing inside me. It was scientifically a no brainer.

In the end, the prolife side seemed much more logically, compassionate and right to me.

Hopefully some of this makes sense to you. If you have any more questions about prolife let me know.

165,"&gt; But there is a risk. 

See my example about being stuck on the plane with a person who has the flu. There is a risk there but we still do not allow the passenger to kill the person with the flu. Generally the risk is so small that it does not justify killing (I am not commenting on your situation because I don't know enough about it. I am talking about 97% of pregnancies that do not fall under the high risk umbrella).

&gt;And pro life generally wants to force women to take that risk. 

Prolifers weigh the risks for both human beings. A normal pregnancy poses very little risk and an abortion is sure death. 

&gt;This has never even been a question for me. I don't want kids at all, actually. I like them, but I don't want any. 

A prolifer would say, adoption. No one is forcing you to raise him or her. I mean, I am sure there are a lot of parents who do not want to raise their born children but we still don't say it is ok to kill them right? 

&gt;My point was that it is ALWAYS a risk to some extent, its painful as hell too, so you would be forcing a woman to go through pain and life risk that she doesn't want to go through which is incredibly inhumane, 

There are epidurals for the pain. In fact, many women who use hypno-birthing techniques report little to no pain. It seems more inhumane to allow one human being to be killed in order to alleviate another from temporary suffering.
 
&gt;and that this baby is NOT wanted. 

Well this I don't agree with. The baby is not wanted by you and the father. I want him or her :). I have adoption in my family. I also know that there are many, many couples looking to adopt. In fact, there are 36 couples waiting for every 1 adoption. See [here](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families). 

&gt;Pro lifers want me to take this risk, endure all this pain, for a baby that neither I or my boyfriend want to care for. That is inhumane to me AND the baby.

Here is the way a prolifer looks at it. It doesn't matter if a person is wanted by their parents or not. We do not get to kill a child just because they are an orphan. And sure death is a bigger sacrifice than pain. Pain can be managed, death can not be reversed. 

I think it is much more humane to give the baby a chance at life. I know many people who are not raised by their biological parents and none of them have ever said that they would rather be dead. 

Hope this helps to see the other perspective.

167,"**Maternal death**

Maternal death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ""the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.""

There are two performance indicators that are sometimes used interchangeably: maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate, which confusingly both are abbreviated ""MMR"". The world maternal mortality rate has declined 44% since 1990, but still every day 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) this is equivalent to ""about one woman every two minutes and for every woman who dies, 20 or 30 encounter complications with serious or long-lasting consequences. Most of these deaths and injuries are entirely preventable.""

UNFPA estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013.

168,"This sound like pure fear mongering to me. Here are the stats,

&gt;You literally have about a 1 in 5,000 chance of dying in childbirth in a DEVELOPED country. That is 0.02% (and this includes woman who are not exhibiting normal healthy pregnancies). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death
My chances of dying from the flu are 3,697 in 100, 000. That is 3.5%. My chances form dying of the flu are significantly higher than dying from child birth. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/flu.htm
Anyone who know statistics know that this is a very, very, very, extremely small percent.

To a prolifer that would be like saying I can kill the person sitting next to me with the flu on a plane because I might get it (the flu) and die. 

The risk has to be significant or it is not considered a medical abortion but an elective one.

Listen I don't know your situations and I do not want you to think I am criticizing you or judging you. I am woman and I have been pregnant. I have also given birth. The truth is that it really isn't so scary or bad. Pregnancy for the most part is very safe in a developed country.

I do realize that there are cases where a woman's life is really at risk (ex: ectopic pregnancies, risk of preeclampsia) but to think that all pregnancies fall under this category is simply not true.

It sounds like you are getting an elective abortion though. I mean my sister has 4 born children and gave birth and she weighed 100 pounds.

The problem is situations in which a woman's life is threatened accounts for LESS THAN 1% of all abortions currently performed in the US. 

The question (which you did point out) is this: At what point should we classify someone as a person? Should it be the point at which a being gains the ability to become aware of itself? If that's the case, should we consider newborns to have personhood? Humans do not become self-aware until about 18 months after birth. 

A person should never be able to take away the life of another person if that person has done nothing but exist (confusing sentence, sorry it's really the only way I could word it). Every person deserves the right to live a life. 

At the end of the day, since the goal here is to make sure that NO person has their right to life infringed upon, and since the definition of personhood will always unclear, why not assume that a being becomes a person earlier in development rather than later? This way no one gets their right to life infringed upon.

179,"&gt;My goal here is not to be antagonistic at all and I apologize as a male that I can not and will not ever understand the pressure, and complexity many woman face in regards to unplanned pregnancy. But at the core of my question is the question of life, is the fetus, specimen, tissue (whatever we call it) alive, human, sentient?

Well, see, one problem with that proposition is that clearly most people who go on the ""pro-life"" side don't demonstrate by their actions that they actually do make life qua life the core of their question.

Do you favor mandatory blood donation?

Mandatory organ donation?

If not, then your argument isn't really that people, as a general category, have an obligation to make use of their bodies to continue the lives of others, but that specifically women do. And I'd say the argument that women, and women alone, have a special burden to donate their bodies for the wellbeing of others but that men are exempt from this requirement shows that the issue isn't really life.

If your concern was actually, truly, no self deception, the preservation of human life then you'd favor mandatory blood and organ donation.

Likewise, if your overriding concern was actually, truly, no self deception, preventing abortion then you'd be donating every cent you could spare to Planned Parenthood, because the science is quite clear: the only method that has ever succeeded at lowering the abortion rate is providing free, low effort [1], birth control. Especially to teenagers.

Yet the overwhelming majority of ""pro-life"" organizations (even the Protestant or theoretically non-religious ones) are opposed to most or all forms of contraception. There have been ""pro-life"" arguments to the effect that any use of contraception is inherently anti-life.

************************

For me the answer to the question is pretty simple. I value actual human beings over potential human beings. I value the health, wellbeing, and bodily autonomy of women over the hypothetical humanity of fetuses.

The idea of a government forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term against her will is viscerally repellent to me. Even rape seems like less of a violation. The very concept of a person's volition being ripped away from them forcing them to risk their health and lives simply because some religious fruitcakes have some beliefs seems like the plot to a horror movie, not a sane political position.

183,"The major aspect of disagreement in the abortion issue is the two sides have drastically different stances on fetal right to life. The pro-life group thinks an embryo is equal to the woman carrying it. The pro-choice view sees the woman as having rights that should not be suspended in favor of her pregnancy.

Is the embryo human? Genetically and developmentally of course it is. There is  a lot more to the issue thn species.

Consider for a moment that about 60% of abortions occur to women who already have children. These are not teenagers facing first time pregnancies. They have been through pregnancy and birth already. They know what it does to their bodies, their livelihood, and their families. They choose to abort because, for whatever reason that is no business of yours, they feel unable or unwilling to carry to term. 

There is so much more to the issue thn whether or not the embryo is alive or human.

Many pro-life people I have talked to balk at the idea of forced organ or blood donation and yet think nothing of condemning a woman to doing just that for the happenstance of having. Working uterus. 

It isn't merely 9 months, either. The body goes through tremendous physical and hormonal changes that can take up to 2 years to return to pre-pregnancy state. Add in that here in the US maternity leave is often unpaid. These is  tremendous stress on a person's financial situation on top of everything else.

I can understand being against abortion. There are ways to dramatically reduce the number of abortions through education and access to birth control. Two things the pro-life camp is often opposed to, especially if they come from a religious/philosophical slant that tends to see pregnancy as punishment for sex.

In the grand scheme of things I will always side with the born woman over the embryo in her uterus.",7,1505058512,2017-09-10 11:48:32

no person has a right to put your health at risk to keep her alive, so there's no reason for a fetus to have such a right. pregnancy is not a joke. it's a serious health risk, and even if you've had multiple uneventful childbirths, your next pregnancy could still kill you.

people ITT referring to the pregnant person's autonomy are spot-on. in every other case where a person's survival depends on some rescuer putting their own health at risk, the rescuer gets to decide if they're okay with that. the person putting their body on the line always, ALWAYS gets to choose.",10,1505023471,2017-09-10 02:04:31

FWIW I think for a lot of us on the pro-choice side don't view fetus sentience as the core issue, but rather bodily autonomy. See JJT's A Defense of Abortion: ""I propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception."" Read her argument here - http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm

If you will not entertain that argument, though, the CDC has about 92% of abortions in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm?s_cid=ss6208a1_w 

Philosophically, what do you believe gives a human being a right to life? I think you would struggle to come up with something that gives a 13 week old fetus a right to life but doesn't grant a right to life to something to which you probably don't grant the right to life. (A unique human DNA code doesn't do it unless you want to grant the right to life to tumors. Potentiality arguments are philosophical trash because an egg and a sperm also have potential to become full humans, and I assume you don't think it's genocide if you masturbate... and around 50% of fertilized eggs are spontaneously miscarried so even by the numbers game potential ain't as great as you may think.)

FWIW, being unable to draw a clear line between ""no right to life embryo/fetus"" and ""yes right to life full human for sure"" doesn't mean there is no difference, just as I would struggle to draw a perfect line between ""poor"" and ""rich""... but clearly there is a difference between poor and rich. If you can accept that soooomewhere in there there is a point that a collection of human cells doesn't have full personhood rights, you're essentially making a weak pro-choice argument, and are likely approving of a very large percentage of abortions that currently happen, as most people abort quite quickly. 

Note: I do come from a bio background but I view abortion from very philosophical terms (and took a Philosophy of Reproduction class in college). I don't like arguing ""is it human"" or ""is it alive"" because that feels like arguing about weird technicalities. The questions are ""does it have a right to life"" and, a la JJT, ""does its right to life supersede my right to my body""-- can you hook me up to another human against my will and say, ""Yeah, you are required to keep this other human alive, at risk to yourself"". 

A few other things you may be interested in:

I think there is a serious minimization of how likely unplanned pregnancies are in pro-life circles. (An attitude of ""only someone irresponsible could accidentally become pregnant"") Here's a little more info on birth control failures over a 10 year span (vs a 1 year span, which is what we typically see reported... you have sex for a lot more than 1 year!) - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/14/sunday-review/unplanned-pregnancies.html?_r=0

If you maybe think it might be that pooooossibly some very early abortions are okay, but anyone who gets a late term abortion is definitely evil, it may be worth reading a little about what kinds of reasons lead to someone getting late term abortions and what the current laws require of people who are stuck in fucking heartbreaking situations. No one carries a baby 8 months and then just decides they don't want it - http://jezebel.com/interview-with-a-woman-who-recently-had-an-abortion-at-1781972395 and https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/18/late-term-abortion-experience-donald-trump ",19,1504999739,2017-09-09 19:28:59
204,"The question is hardly whether an unborn fetus is human – if it's a human fetus, it's obviously human – but whether it's a *person*, and whether ""fetal personhood"" should take precedence over the personhood of the one who's pregnant.

As the pregnant person is provably right in front of me, alive and sentient, making a decision about their health, I'm not hard pressed to deny them their personhood.",40,1504998269,2017-09-09 19:04:29

1. Even though a fetus is human and is alive, it's not a person.
2. Many abortions are done for medical decisions.

206,"&gt; Isn't it classified as death because there is no going back, unlike cardiac arrest?

Remember that it's classified as death because somebody classified it as death.  Don't rely on the definitions, think about the underlying reality.  The decision to call it ""brain death"" was a marketing decision -- it could just as easily have been called ""brain failure.""  Or ""total neuroischemic insult.""

""There's no going back"" isn't really an adequate argument -- there's no going back from a variety of things, like having a leg amputated, or kidney ischemia.  I agree that it's a necessary condition for something being ""death"" -- death should be something irreversible.  But it's not a sufficient condition.

208,"&gt; Biological death is when the body's organ systems cease to function due to failure of circulation, respiration, or brain activity.

If the organ systems ceased to function for some other reason, you don't think it would be death?  Why those three systems and not any of the other systems?

&gt; Without any of those working, the body's cells no longer have an environment where they can grow, metabolize, and reproduce.

This is an odd statement.  For the three organ systems you allude to (circulatory, respiratory, and nervous), one of them can fail (the brain) while still leaving the body's cells in an environment in which they can grow, metabolize, and reproduce.  Additionally, other organ systems can fail and meet that criteria (hepatic, digestive, renal).

&gt; if you are brain dead, machines are need to circulate blood and oxygen for your organs because your brain doesn't tell them to work anymore.

Your brain doesn't tell your lungs to work, it's true.  But this is a very strange explanation for why brain death means death.  That's a very small fraction of the function of your brain (respiratory drive).  If I disabled just that part of somebody's brain, they would need those machines.  Many people need respirators for a variety of reasons.

Also you said ""them"", which is odd.  The heart continues beating without brain function.  It doesn't need to be told by the brain.

---

In other words, I still don't appreciate any argument you've made for distinguishing brain death as being distinct from any other organ death.

---

&gt; The early human fetus does not require a brain to grow; it requires a stable environment/dependence on the mother but it is still functioning.

Well, yes and no.  It won't be swallowing or moving as much, so there's a higher risk of polyhydramnios.

---

&gt; The difference between a brain dead patient and a fetus is that the patient should have brain function(although exceptions are made for children under one year of age).

You have this idea of ""should"" here that is interesting.  It works for your argument because you're still trying to state that brain death is because other organ systems will inevitably fail (it's not because of that, and that logic will not apply to any other organs).  When you shift that argument, I think you'll find this piece no longer works.

&gt;&gt; Hold up. You made an (implicitly moral) distinction between your insulin dependence and the dependence of somebody on a respirator. You've gone on and on about the distinction between ""machine dependence"" and ""machine living."" You said that it was the difference between dying immediately and living for a while. I asked what time duration is your cut-off between ""immediately"" and ""a while."" You cannot answer that with ""however long it takes them to die.""

&gt; I was pointing out the difference between being dead and being dependant. A brain dead patient does not have a time limit -their heart will stop beating, but the brain will not stop functioning because it is already dead, as opposed to the patient on life support. 

No, you were pointing out the difference between insulin dependence and being on a respirator; neither of those people is dead.

This simply isn't true.  It is not biologically dead.  I'm also not sure what you mean by ""temporarily"" -- we are all only temporary.  The whole organism *is* growing.  It is a living organism.

266,"I'm aware, but that's where we disagree. Personhood for me is being a live human organism. 

I think a good example is hydatidiform moles. They grow quite rapidly and in some ways mimic a normal pregnancy (often referred to as a (“molar pregnancy”). However, because hydatidiform moles contain only paternally derived chromosomes, they are distinguishable from zygotes based on their molecular composition. Moreover, hydatidiform moles behave quite differently from embryos: they grow as a chaotic mass of disorganized cells and tissues, all of which are unrelated to each other or to anything resembling a whole. Despite the fact that hydatidiform moles are generated from human gametes, they do not exhibit an embryonic pattern of organization or molecular composition; they are a collection of human cells, but not a human organism.

In the same way a brain dead human no longer qualifies as a whole, living organism. So to be a bit clearer in terms of the brain dead patient, they are no longer considered a living organism. There are parts that can continue to grow and live temporarily but, the whole organism is not growing and is biologically dead(the body parts growing are disconnected from the organism as a whole.

Brain death isn't considered death because it's ""real death"", it's considered death because there is no return, at all.

&gt;You distinguish between your insulin and a respirator as a matter of time that you would survive. How much time, exactly, is the border? I bet I could unplug every support system of a brain dead person and be fine for 30 seconds to a minute, no question. So is it two minutes? Three minutes? Four minutes?

 If they are alive than the time limit is however long it takes for them to die. A brain dead patient is dead prior to unplugging the respirator, however for a person dependant on the respirator, they will only die if they are disconnected for a time period (however long that is).

267,"&gt; technically they have already died, if their brain is no longer functioning. 

I find it very frustrating when you use language like that.  As I've expressed repeatedly, it does not help me understand your view in the least when you turn to definitions.

We are discussing the beginning and end of personhood; when it is and *why* it should be then and not another time.  From a biological standpoint, the human being is not dead in the least.  From a medical standpoint, they are brain-dead.  From my standpoint, there is no longer a person in there.

---

&gt; A human who is brain dead no longer qualifies as a living human organism.

They absolutely do.  They meet the definition of life, human, and organism.

&gt; While an zygote/embryo/fetus acts as an organism growing as a whole, a brain dead human acts as mere cells.  ...

Your gist seems to be that a brain-dead person doesn't count as alive because they lack coordinated function to pursue their interests as an organism.  Is that your statement?  Could you provide me with a clear definition of what distinguishes a body behaving ""as an organism"" vs as ""mere cells""?

Because many of the brain-dead person's organ systems are still interacting in coordinated ways.  Conversely, many brain-alive people have severe disabilities that could characterize them as... ""disconnected"" in the way you describe.

&gt; Individual cells in the body do not stop growing.

No idea what you mean by this.  Cells generally don't just keep getting bigger (except kind of adipocytes, and even they have a limit); nor do they just keep duplicating (except stem cells and cancers).  Certainly their behavior is not remarkably different in brain-dead people vs not.

---

&gt; On machine support, I think that is leaning more on dependency, as the human continues to act as a human organism. I myself am dependent on insulin. However if I were to stop with my regular doses.. I would not be dead, I would soon die, but I would not be dead upon stopping the doses. If you unplug a person on life support you're letting them die.

But is this significant for personhood?

You distinguish between your insulin and a respirator as a matter of time that you would survive.  How much time, exactly, is the border?  I bet I could unplug every support system of a brain dead person and be fine for 30 seconds to a minute, no question.  So is it two minutes?  Three minutes?  Four minutes?

What about somebody with an LVAD -- a Left Ventricular Assist Device?  Or an artificial heart?

...please, let's only get into this if you think it's significant for personhood.  Why are you trying to make these distinctions?",1,1504430149,2017-09-03 05:15:49
268,"Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I appreciate your willingness to continue this conversation with me. On the subject of whether these patients are alive.. technically they have already died, if their brain is no longer functioning. 

Anyway, I haven't been clear on a few of these subjects so I will rephrase. A human who is brain dead no longer qualifies as a living human organism.
While an zygote/embryo/fetus acts as an organism growing as a whole, a brain dead human acts as mere cells. Specific human parts may continue to grow for a very short period of time but will soon stop. Individual cells in the body do not stop growing. They can continue for a temporary time period. What stops is the body's behaviour as an organism. Functions can still operate but they are doing so in ways that are separated and disconnected from the whole organism. I apologize for the confusion I have caused.

On the topic of how long the body can be kept ""alive"", I did not know that. I'll have to learn more about it, and once again I thank you for bringing it to my attention

On machine support, I think that is leaning more on dependency, as the human continues to act as a human organism. I myself am dependent on insulin. However if I were to stop with my regular doses.. I would not be dead, I would soon die, but I would not be dead upon stopping the doses. If you unplug a person on life support you're letting them die. If you unplug a person who is brain dead you allow their body to die (as some cells will still be alive but not for long without a respirator.

278,"&gt;If I had to choose between preventing someone from being tortured to death and preventing 100 women from getting an abortion I will always choose to prevent the guy from being tortured to death

But that is because you don't agree that abortion results in the death of a human person. You already agreed earlier that if what you consider to be persons are involved, you go with sparing life above avoiding pain.

&gt;do you save the doctor or not?

I save him every time. Saving a man who kills others is not equal to killing others, so the moral choice here is between saving a man or letting him die. I always choose life.

&gt;It doesn't matter. Forced pregnancy is objectively torture...

Even if I grant that these pregnancies are a form of torture, it still does not conflict with what I've been saying here. Prioritizing values means sometimes you have to choose one over the other while still finding worth in _both_ values. Earlier you said that you'd permit torture to save an infinite number of people from dying. How does your critique not apply to your own choice?

&gt;But you haven't proven that torture is worse than death

Death is worse because its effects are always broader and last forever.

&gt;I doubt that you have seriously considered the fact that while being subjected to torture you'd rather be dead.

My thoughts would not be clear under such circumstances. I'm certain at the end of any torture, I'd prefer to live, even if only on principle.

&gt;Okay, well I don't care if you dissociate yourself from the abortion prohibitionist movement, because you share the same goddamn objective

So? This is a logical fallacy. You can't use others' beliefs and actions to dismiss my position purely because we share some points. Whatever point you're trying to make here is a far stretch. Focus on the argument, not on people unrelated to this particular discussion.

&gt;The same button can be set to end someone else's life with the your same logic applying, but you previously answered that you won't press it under those conditions

I'm not sure I ever said that. Or if I did, I must have misunderstood that which I was responding to. In any case, same argument applies whether I am inadvertently being killed or another. I would push the button if it meant more lives are spared than lost.

&gt;There is a magic shotgun. If you suck on the barrel and pull the trigger all abortions will be ended. There's nothing intrinsically ""evil"" about pulling a trigger.

Since my death isn't a criterion to end the abortions, then I can pull the trigger. I can just hope that I survive or that the shell is a dud, etc. All four criteria are met.

&gt;Pressing a button that you know will kill you is tantamount to commiting suicide

Nope. Suicide is _willed_. If you want to play semantics and call this suicide, then that's fine with me. In that case, I only oppose willed suicide. Un-willed suicide can be permitted if the Principle of Double Effect is adhered to.",2,1504311288,2017-09-01 20:14:48
279,"&gt;I didn't mean to get into definitions about what ""evil"" is. I was just trying to show that preserving life is a greater good than avoiding pain. Since you would choose to spare lives over avoiding pain, I gather you generally agree.


Yes but you have overlooked the bulk of my response to your moral scenario. You should also take note of the edit I added. Your scenario does not accurately reflect the moral nature of the issue of abortion. If I had to choose between preventing someone from being tortured to death and preventing 100 women from getting an abortion I will always choose to prevent the guy from being tortured to death. Your ethical framework requires you to always elect that a man be tortured. So let's re contextualize your proposed scenario to better illustrate the moral bankruptcy of your ethical system.


There is a house on fire. Trapped inside is a doctor who provides abortions. If he dies then 100 women will be prevented from getting an abortion. You are in a position to save his life. Based on your ethical system and your obligation to save lives, do you save the doctor or not? I save the doctor every. single. time.


&gt;I disagree.


Not an argument.


&gt;Besides the fact that torture is also against Catholic ethics (CCC 2297), I oppose it on the grounds that it violates the dignity of the human person and treats them as a mere means to an end.


It doesn't matter. Forced pregnancy is objectively torture and you are advocating for laws which objectively result in women being forced to remain pregnant against their own will. You have no grounds by which you can advance an objective appeal against this fact that isn't rooted in semantics and that doesn't require defining torture in a manner that is narrow enough to exclude forced/coerced pregnancy but broad enough to include other techniques which require force/coercion.


&gt;If you force me to choose between death and torture, of course I will always opt for the lesser of two evils (torture). Again, this is prioritization of goods. By permitting torture to save a life, I am not therefore relinquishing my opposition to torture. I'm saying that when two goods are pitted against each other, I always opt for the greatest good, while regretting any harm to the lesser good.


But you haven't proven that torture is worse than death, and in the scenario you advanced, a person is actually getting tortured to death. Since you are now advancing a completely different comparative question, I do not agree that the preference for being tortured over being killed is universal and I doubt that you have seriously considered the fact that while being subjected to torture you'd rather be dead.


&gt;I don't care about the ""movement"" because I am not responsible for the actions of others. I can criticize them for their misled views and try to beckon them to my side, but ultimately my pro-life stance is not defined by anything external to myself and my principles. Insofar as other members of the ""movement"" act inappropriately or spout nonsense, I utterly disassociate myself from them and consider our causes separate.


Okay, well I don't care if you dissociate yourself from the abortion prohibitionist movement, because you share the same goddamn objective and fundamentally lack a particular consistency with your principles that is not exhibited by people who are pro-choice.


&gt;The button is described as having two purposes: ending abortion, and killing me. Therefore, under Principle of Double Effect, I can will the ending of abortion while not intending to end my life, thus bringing about a good in proportion to the unintended evil effect. Also, there is nothing intrinsically evil about pressing  button. This meets the four criteria for a morally good act.


This isn't an argument. The same button can be set to end someone else's life with the your same logic applying, but you previously answered that you won't press it under those conditions I see no reason by which you can justify not pressing button based on your obligation to save lives. You can't fundamentally assert anything along the lines of not having just authority to determine whether or not a random person lives or dies. By not electing to push the button you've given yourself the authority to choose that a bunch of fetuses die. And even if you attempt to argue further nonsense, we can change the function of the button from ending all abortions but killing someone to ending all abortions but torturing an infinite number of people. And if you don't like that, then we could make it so that the button ends all abortions but all newborns are born without arms or a net number of babies equivalent to the number of abortions performed annually live for only 3 days or maybe they all suffer from some other terrible abnormality. Use your imagination. I'd there any condition with which preventing a fetus from getting aborted becomes no longer worthwhile? As far as I can tell pretty much all of these scenarios still require you to fulfill your moral obligation to save lives and push the button.


&gt;If you reword and say that I must pull a gun so as to kill myself, and then abortion will be ended, then I would _not_ do it. It fails the first or at least the second criterion, as shooting myself in the head with the intent to kill is an evil action in itself that is entirely intended.


Bullshit. There is a magic shotgun. If you suck on the barrel and pull the trigger all abortions will be ended. There's nothing intrinsically ""evil"" about pulling a trigger.


But seriously, you can fuck right the hell off with your sophistry. Pressing a button that you know will kill you is tantamount to commiting suicide even if the button does something else in addition. It doesn't matter if you're pressing it to achieve the other thing, you're still commiting suicide in order to do so. Like I said earlier, perhaps you wish to change your answer, but based on the ethical framework you have proposed, I'm pretty damn sure you're obligated to push that button one way or another.",1,1504307250,2017-09-01 19:07:30

I'm only saying that I'm not 100% confident in my ability to discern it in every case. I feel pretty confident here, though.

281,"&gt;Moral questions don't always have obvious answers. What matters is that I apply my standards consistently and fairly. I am confident about my answer here, and I answered in such a way as to consider _all_ moral values at play, giving priority to those greater values. That's the best I can do given _any_ moral question.


This isn't an argument, and I completely disagree. Morality is objective. Moral problems can be evaluated so that moral acts can be deemed as being either permissible or not.


&gt;Let me pose a question to you. Which is the greater evil: shooting 100 people in their sleep (no pain), or torturing one person to death? Is the avoidance of suffering really your greatest priority?


This is a pretty lousy question, because the objective answer to this moral question is entirely contingent upon how you define ""evil."" If we apply universal preferability as a means to evaluate whether or not being shot is preferable to being tortured, it is clear that torture is the greater ""evil."" There's no means by which to objectively evaluate whether or not killing multiple people in a way that is not gruesome is more ""evil"" than killing one in a way that is beyond an unprovable assertion that this is the case. Based on what I understand ""evil"" to be, I would have to say torturing one person is more evil than killing an infinite number of people. However, were I to be given the option of choosing between allowing one person to be tortured to death over allowing an infinite number of people to be killed, I would choose the former because we can apply another question of universal preference and conclude that being alive and in pain is preferable to being dead and not in pain. Ultimately this means that the value of the lives of the many outweigh the value of the lives of the few, given the options available as well as the fact that the different means produce the same end. All this being said, this question does not accurately reflect the inherent moral nature of the issue of abortion. Under a pro-life framework that would be consistent with your ethical code, if you were given the choice of allowing (or not) one person to be tortured to death in such a way that it prevented 100 women from getting an abortion you would have no choice but to elect that a man be tortured to death. This is because not only do you have an imperative to save lives but you also fundamentally have no moral grounds on which you can object to torture. Forcing a woman to be pregnant against her will is torture, therefore advocating for the law to be changed to the result of women being forced to remain pregnant against their will is tantamount to advocating that women be tortured. I suspect that you will try to weasel your way out of this one. Go ahead.
I already have another hypothetical moral scenario prepared.


[Edit: it should also be noted that under my moral framework the answer to the variation of your proposed scenario is starkly clear. You do not torture a man to prevent X number of abortions. Under your moral framework the answer still remains as obscure as the original scenario which you proposed. Whichever choice you make, you must apply that evaluation consistently]


&gt;I don't speak for the entire pro-life movement. I'm talking about Catholic ethics and the Catholic arm of the movement. Catholics oppose war (CCC 2307) and the death penalty (CCC 2267). These references are from the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and they are found in the same place where abortion is condemned (CCC 2271). Therefore I feel that my argument does stand, even in context.


It doesn't matter. Your movement is characterized by a lack of principle. The same cannot be said of people who are pro-choice as they all universally agree that abortion should be legal within some time frame regardless of whether or not they agree on what that time frame should be.


&gt;I never said I would kill myself. I am willing to _be killed_, but I will not take my own life. Same rules apply. I won't kill. Even myself.

283,"**Principle of double effect**

The principle of double effect—also known as the rule of double effect; the doctrine of double effect, often abbreviated as DDE or PDE, double-effect reasoning; or simply double effect—is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers, and some others, have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). The first known example of double-effect reasoning is Thomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work Summa Theologica.

This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:

the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;

the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;

the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.

Sure, but the use of the qualifier ""might"" indicates that you don't actually know what the more moral choice would be. You're just speculating. That's not a good enough answer for me.


&gt;Even if I had chosen the embryos, that wouldn't be an invalidation of the ability to experience pain. It would simply be a matter of prioritization. Yes, avoiding pain is good. However, saving lives is priority. Prioritizing one does not invalidate the other.


I disagree. I think it invalidates any appeal to fetal sentience an abortion prohibitionist may use to justify an opposition to abortion on either legal or moral grounds as this ""prioritization"" should be considered in context with other ""pro-life"" premises regarding the nature of moral value and life. A person who is emotionally mature and can actually exercise empathy will recognize that they should choose the room with the entity that can actually suffer.

&gt;I think the presence of personal and completely unique human DNA brings upon life, but you seem to dissent from that.


Absolutely. You have it completely backwards. The human being is not defined by human DNA, human DNA is defined by the human being. There is a scientific model which predicts how species will change phenotypically over time in response to their environment. It is known as the theory of evolution and it is a scientific fact about the forces which govern nature. This model dictates that over a long period of time, say 200,000 years, the genetic code of a specific kind of living thing will change to the degree that it can no longer be considered as being of the same kind of living things as the ancestors it evolved from. This means that you cannot use the genetic composition possessed by human beings today as a metric by which to define what is and is not a human being 200,000 years from now. The logical consequence of you doing so is that ""human beings"" born in 200,000 years cannot be categorized as human beings. This presents a problem if you wish to advance the moral proposition that ""it is wrong for one human being to kill another"" as a moral proposition that has any degree of objectivity and universality, and you necessarily must adopt a position of objective and universal morality in order argue against my position on abortion because my position is that universally, there is nothing objectively immoral about abortions which occur within the timeframe laid out by roe v wade. The reason why this is the case is because if you define human beings by the properties of the human genome as it exists today, and human entities born in the future do not possess the same genetic structure as human beings today and thus categorically cannot be classified as ""human beings,"" and it is not wrong to kill things which are not human beings, and imagining that it is possible for people to time travel travel into the future, then hypothetically I could time travel into the future it would not be immoral for me to wantonly kill any number of these non-human beings. So do you agree or disagree that it is not morally wrong for me to kill human descendant entities which are not human beings if I were to time travel 200,000 years into the future?


&gt;Question Dodge, I asked ""Do you support regulating the Free Will to commit Murder?""


I don't know what you are asking. You haven't defined ""free will"" and it's pretty clear that you have an objectively inaccurate definition of ""murder."" That being said, people already commit murder all the time by virtue of their own free will. Furthermore, the law isn't designed to regulate people's willingness to commit murder, the law is designed to protect people's inalienable right to life.

This is exactly why you need to just let women make their own decisions. You can't possibly know all the circumstances surrounding each woman who decides to get an abortion. Maybe some circumstances are slightly more understandable in your mind, but we can't just have a blanket ban. We need to trust women to make their own decisions about what's right for them.",8,1504277176,2017-09-01 10:46:16
290,"If you have no problem with in vitro fertilization (which requires the destruction of viable embryos) then your problem with abortion isn't about the ""personhood"" of embryos, it's about your need to punish women who have sex.",7,1504276660,2017-09-01 10:37:40
291,"Pro-lifer here, so maybe I can help a bit. I love these philosophical approaches because I believe it's the best way we can all move closer to the truth. For context, I adhere to Catholic bioethical principles. Therefore I believe (as many pro-lifers do!) that the unborn _are_ persons. Many people don't realize this.

&gt;In one room is a jar of X embryos that can/will be implanted in a uterus to be developed into a human baby...

Bear in mind that we still have no clue what to do with embryos except keep them frozen. Implanting them into people also violates Catholic moral ethics, so that's not a viable solution. The more pressing issue for Catholics has always been the cessation of the embryo-freezing practice itself.

Therefore the best moral decision might be to save the people in the ""second room"" over the embryos, since the embryos' fate it uncertain and they will likely die (as implanting them is not a solution). This is not me implicitly prioritizing ""sentience"", but rather, trying to save as many lives as possible without violating other moral principles.

&gt;they invalidate the ability to experience pain (as well as personhood) as a relevant property of moral value

Even if I had chosen the embryos, that wouldn't be an invalidation of the ability to experience pain. It would simply be a matter of prioritization. Yes, avoiding pain is good. However, saving lives is priority. Prioritizing one does not invalidate the other. If you put one embryo in a room and two adults in the other, the moral question becomes easier. Save the two!

&gt;Another scenario I thought of is the ""end all abortions button.""

I'm not sure why you think this would be a difficult dilemma. If I could end all abortions I would, even if it meant dying for it. I'm not treating this casually, but from my perspective you're asking me if I would be willing to die to save untold millions. Yes!

Now, as soon as you start attaching evils to the button, I'm out. I'm not going to will the death of people to bring about some moral good. That's literally the _opposite_ of what it means to be pro-life.

&gt;another hypothetical I have used in the past is your mother/sister/wife/daughter was raped and wants an abortion. They are also suicidal and state that they would rather kill themselves than give birth.

I know you're trying to make these questions hard, but I've always felt that it's kind of cheap to directly involve an opponent's family like this. I recommend making it less personal (""someone"" instead of ""you""). People will automatically relate it to themselves anyway.

I would support not aborting, but I wouldn't be angry with them if they went through with it. While circumstances do not make a wrong action right, they do mitigate culpability. Therefore it's not really appropriate to talk about ""punishing"" the women. I wouldn't have abortion doctors punished until after a law is passed and they break it. Also, since you brought suicide up, I would of course support therapy. In fact I support more government assistance for struggling / hurting mothers and I think any law banning abortion should contain such provisions.

On a final note, I would personally warn against designing ad hoc scenarios just for the ""gotcha"" value you can get out of such questions. It's easy to form difficult moral questions to test any given moral value.",1,1504274148,2017-09-01 09:55:48

&gt;Well, evidently you don't have much faith in the power of your ""god"" to intervene in peoples lives in a way that they will decide against getting an abortion, otherwise you'd have no issue with permitting people to access constitutionally protected healthcare.

&gt; I think this is an interesting question as it is the ending of a life, however it is unintentional and I believe we should relax these laws anyway.

Manslaughter can be completely unintentional and therefore accidental. However it can be due to someone's negligence. A pregnant woman going bungee jumping or something of the sort. And this will be the direct consequence of the society you desire. Pregnant women will have to resort to other methods in order to get out of an unwanted pregnancy. This mean ALL miscarriages will have to be investigated and the level of culpability of the woman determined in a court of law. You do realize that? 

&gt; I would not.

Why is the life of a fetus more important than the life of a sentient child? You are willing to violate the bodily autonomy of women in the first case but not the second, meaning you consider fetuses more important than children.

In a secular democratic society, you don't get to hijack governmental operations to force your religious views on others.

300,"&gt;Don't change the question, I have been answering yours, don't be an ass.


I'm illustrating how your question is non-sensical. If I were aborted I wouldn't be able to value my life or concern myself with abortion because I wouldn't exist.


&gt;I would take her to a therapist's office to help her with her suicidal thoughts. And I do not believe they should be because the woman is as much a victim as the child, she may not know it yet, but she will 5, 10, maybe even 20 years down the road.


So based on your previous answers, you value your wife's life but not as much as her well being and to some degree you are willing to risk both by preventing her from getting an abortion if she were to be raped, suicidal, and desire one. That's inherently contradictory and a bit sociopathic. Who are you to decide what is best for your wife? Why should your ideology take precedence over how she desires to manage her healthcare needs? Do you realize that pregnancy can put a woman's life at risk? How would you reconcile your actions in preventing her from getting an abortion were she to die in childbirth?


What if the clinician advises you to get her an abortion? Do you follow his professional medical advice? What do you do once the rapists baby is born? Do you raise it as your own or put it up for adoption?

It should also be noted here that science cannot prove questions regarding the nature of value and morality. That's why this debate is entirely philosophical. Science can't prove that abortion is wrong or that it should be illegal. All science can prove at best is that unborn cellular life is a life form. But not all life forms are equally valuable. You admit this as much yourself when you state that you would save your wife but not your dog.


I have two more question out of curiosity based on how you have answered the last scenario.


First question. There is a house that is on fire. In one room there is a button that if pressed will do anything ranging from making abortion illegal to guaranteing that no one will ever get an abortion again. In the other room is your wife. Which do you choose?

Sure, but I also framed the question to ask what you would choose if it was *one* embryo and *one* baby. But this still begs the question. What do you mean when you state that ""it is saving more lives"" and how do you know that this is true?


&gt;But I think these kinds of loaded questions are toxic to dialogue.


This is how philosophy works buddy. Contrary to your understanding, this whole debate is a philosophical one not a scientific one. In philosophy we test premises and arguments using hypothetical scenarios. When I ask you which one you would save and why, I'm testing the premise that embryos have the same value as a baby.


The fact that you would save a jar of embryos over a baby is really telling of your abject lack of critical thinking skills. Furthermore I would contend that you have no moral high ground with which you can stand on, because you have essentially elected to let an infant suffer a horrible painful death by immolation to save a jar of cellular clusters. To some degree this nullifies the validity of being able to experience pain as a relevant property to which you can justify any sort of opposition (especially a moral one) to abortion in the first place, because your choice implicitly ignores the value of sentience since you defined life so broadly that preventing X number of non-sentient cellular clusters from being destroyed is preferable to preventing a living breathing person from being burned alive.


Let's change the scenario a bit. There is a house on fire. In one room is a jar of 100 embryos. In the other room is your wife. Or maybe your infant daughter. Or someone you care about. Maybe even your dog. You can only save one.

That is not true.  On several levels.

1. The end of brain function does not necessitate the end of the body's cellular function in a particularly special way.  While there may be limits on how long we have kept brain-dead people alive at this time, those limits are not absolute.  You've mentioned 30 days; a quick Google search turns up people whose bodies have been kept alive for more than four months after brain death.

2. The failure of other organ systems *does* mean inevitable demise.  If you have complete liver failure, you will die and there is nothing that medicine can do to stop it (short an immediate transplant).  No machine support can replace it.

My point here was that your reasoning seems to permit ALL killing. If abortion is just bringing about something natural (death), then so is all killing. Isn't murdering an innocent family in cold blood just bringing about something natural, albeit a bit earlier?",1,1504139916,2017-08-30 20:38:36
330,"&gt; I'm guessing you disagree with people in China who dump their female infants into trash cans to die. Yet you probably haven't volunteered to adopt any.

China's moral failing is in the selection of male over females. That's pure unadulterated sexism. It has nothing to do with abortion. Although in t he case of China, at least abortion would be more humane than dumping babies in dumpsters.

&gt; I mean, death is itself natural? How does your view not justify all killing, indiscriminately?

That presumes there aren't other moral measures that govern the killing in general. That said, I think euthanasia in certain cases to be moral. There are some who suffer from illness where their quality of life is not worth the pain. I'm glad society is re-evaluating these moral concerns.

332,"&gt; I didn't want to get pedantic

This conversation by nature needs to be somewhat pedantic.

&gt; Pro-lifers believe fetuses ARE persons, not merely potential persons.

I too switched to ""person"" in my goal to be clear in what I meant. Sure, a cluster of cells is life. So is a weed and a mosquito. So, ""life"" doesn't have a specific value. I think your shift in word usage implies that.

So, the reason I say that a fetus is a potential person is because they don't yet have value as a person. In the early days of development, the value of a fetus is nothing more than the value conferred on the fetus, usually by the parents. They are looking forward to their baby. They are also willing to take the risk involved in having a child, both the biological risks of bringing a fetus to term and the risk of raising that child and the consequences of that.

This is why when a couple miscarriages, they can be emotionally devastated. They have invested emotional value that they've lost.

When a baby is born, there's a value attributed to it. The collective group of people who have brought this baby to term and even society itself has said ""We've made a commitment to see this baby grow into an adult."" Some societies are better than others in this supportive process.

Then a human starts developing it's own value. In it's learning and eventual contribution back to society. As people gain knowledge and wisdom, they just become more and more valuable.

This is where I am at odds with religion. The concept of a soul and sin reverses this value. It sees a soul-infused fetus as being equal to that of any other human and more over as we grow and sin, religion views us as eroding. As collecting more and more sin in our life. And as such, an adult has less value than an ""innocent child"". This is a backwards perspective and it depends on undemonstrative concepts like a soul and sin.

As for Pro-Lifer's conferring value on someone else's fetus. It's meaningless unless they are willing to support the mother during their pregnancy and childbirth and willing to adopt the baby.

&gt; There is a moral difference between something unintentionally dying and something being intentionally killed.

From my moral perspective, abortion is just doing that which happens naturally anyway. ",4,1504136138,2017-08-30 19:35:38

The reality is that the human body aborts fetuses all the time.

The reality is that the majority of miscarriages happen without the pregnant woman even realizing that she's pregnant. It will come across like a heavy period.

First, I'm not sure what you mean by ""indicators of death"" or ""standards of ""living"".  There is the biological definition of living, which a fetus unequivocally meets.  Then there are criteria for death that doctors use, for which breathing/apnea can be a component (it's part of the diagnosis of brain death, for example), but never by itself.

Second, fetuses do breathe, and OP's argument already uses fetal functions that aren't present at fertilization, so I'm not sure it changes anything.

&gt; Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do something. 

I agree, and I think you've stepped on a significant difference between the philosophical aspects of this and the practical aspects of it.

I am firm in my belief that irretrievable loss of all forebrain function means that I, as a person, have ceased to exist.  I think that if you had irretrievable loss of all forebrain function would mean that you as a person have ceased to exist.

There are a couple of reasons that it's not advantageous to try to extend our diagnoses for brain death to include loss of all forebrain function.  Please note that I don't do a lot of neurology, critical care, or end-of-life care -- I'm lucky as an ob/gyn to have mostly young and healthy patients, and excellent colleagues in these specialties.

It's my impression that most disease processes that cause large losses of brain function will not do it to just the forebrain.  Hypoxic injury would affect brain function starting in ""watershed"" areas (the borders between the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, for example) and work back.

So if a patient is not apneic, but has brainstem reflexes and complete loss of brain function, what to do?

Generally, discuss goals of care with the family.  Discuss possibility of recovery.  There's (presumably) no emergency; the discussion can straddle their grief process.  It may be reasonable to withdraw care.

Due to my beliefs, I'm not going to go and protest outside abortion centres or intimidate those who choose to get an abortion, I am not going to petition politicians (it should be said that I'm apolitical and not even american) to draft bills and pass legislation that practically eradicates the already few choices that women have in terms of medical autonomy because that would essentially be getting in the way and working to obstruct these women exercising their god-given free will - which is something i refuse to do.",7,1503935915,2017-08-28 11:58:35
396,"&gt;[Brain death is defined as the irreversible loss of all functions of the brain, including the brainstem.The three essential findings in brain death are coma, absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnoea.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2772257/)

&gt;Absent respiratory efforts in the presence of hypercarbia.
Generally, the apnoea test is performed after the second examination of brainstem reflexes.

It could be working but it shouldn't be working, not if brain death is going to be accurately diagnosed.

&gt;I also think that people who only have brainstem function remaining... well, if I only had brainstem function remaining without a chance for return of higher function, I would not wish to be considered a person any longer.

But that doesn't mean everyone else should have their rights taken away simply because they lack higher brain function - and assuming we did strip rights from these people, does that mean we can do whatever we want with them? Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do something. 

&gt;Why use other definitions of death for those born without a brain? What do you see as drastically different between those born without a brain and those who had a brain and then lost it?

397,"Let's go paragraph by paragraph:

1) Largely correct, but irrelevant. A zygote is human. So what? No human in the world has the right to occupy the body of another without explicit and ongoing consent.

2) Pain perception only applies in third trimester abortions (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16118385) which are illegal in most of the world except in very serious medical situations.

3) Some good arguments here for improving abortion care and prenatal care, but the fact is that abortion is vastly safer than pregnancy and childbirth. Forcing someone to carry a pregnancy to term means gambling with their life.

4) I'm not American so I'll skip the whole Roe v Wade thing.

5) Christianity is fundamentally an immoral religion. The story at the core of it is this: a mass-murdering god decides he wants a kid, so he impregnates a young girl without her consent. When the kid grows up, god decides he should die, so lets him be crucified. God, assuming he exists, has no right to speak on morality when he's so clearly an evil entity.

&gt;The disparity between how the law treats abortion patients and IVF patients reveals an ugly truth about abortion restrictions: that they are often less about protecting life than about controlling women’s bodies. Both IVF and abortion involve the destruction of fertilized eggs that could potentially develop into people. But only abortion concerns women who have had sex that they don’t want to lead to childbirth. Abortion restrictions use unwanted pregnancy as a punishment for “irresponsible sex” and remind women of the consequences of being unchaste: If you didn’t want to endure a mandatory vaginal ultrasound , you shouldn’t have had sex in the first place .

&gt;The law’s conflicting treatment of the two procedures is no coincidence: Anti-choice organizations have avoided targeting IVF even as they’ve sought radical restrictions on abortion access. Conservatives focus on legislation that facilitates embryo donation to other couples, rather than laws that limit the choices of IVF patients; they even take pains to deemphasize the impact of proposed “personhood amendments” on IVF.

425,"Having some brain waves is not equivalent to having a conscious or being sentient. Fetuses are non-sentient beings until right around 26 weeks. The cortical plate isn’t fully developed until then meaning it is impossible for the fetus to perceive any sensation. Just because neurons are starting to develop and there is some rudimentary activity in the brain doesn’t make the fetus have a conscious or sensation perception. Cnidaria have nerve nets, round worms have some cephalization, but evidently we would not consider them to have a mind. Similarly, when a person is pronounced brain dead and has life support pulled they STILL have brain waves! Claiming something has “brain waves” makes it conscious/living/whatever shows a deep biological misunderstanding. 

Furthermore the debate isn’t whether or not a fetus is alive, it’s when its personhood begins. This is a philosophical debate. Plants are alive, but they don’t have feelings and we don’t feel bad about eating them. A fetus does not have “feelings” let alone perception of any sensation. If a person who is on life support is deemed dead (they’ve lost their personhood), because they are brain dead, what are the necessary requirements of the brain to be developed to gain personhood? What are the requirements needed to be considered human? If someone was born severely disabled, unable to produce speech, and severe mental retardation are they considered human? I’m only asking this, because a lot of famous philosophers say no. 

My perspective on the issue though ultimately has nothing to do with my whether or not I believe a fetus is a person. I base my beliefs on utility. What will cause the least amount of pain and suffering in the world- forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term she does not want OR exterminating a non-sentient being. The answer is obvious in these terms. Since the fetus is incapable of feeling pain, but forcing a woman to have an unwanted pregnancy will cause her immense pain, suffering, etc. Yes, there are the exceptions of women who regret their abortion, but they are the exception not the rule. I choose the choice that puts the least amount of suffering into the world.

&gt; Those two stories are just 2 doctors among at least 2,500 members of the Pro-Life OBGYNs, a group of doctors who reject abortion and some of them, former abortionists. (AAPLOG) In fact, Dr. Nathanson has repeatedly debunked the false statistic that illegal abortions mean dangerous and deadly ones. 

Random mid-paragraph pivot, appeal to authority, lacking a citation... oh, right, this is for a pro-life audience.

&gt; Well first, even in a legal abortion, you are losing the life of a child, and consider this on Maternal Death.  Firstly, let us consider, how do we know the number before abortion was legalized, we don’t. So any number is purely speculative.

You ask yourself questions and give yourself the wrong answer.  Why are we present for your mental masturbation, if you're only going to shoot blanks?

http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/401754

&gt; Secondly, Dr. Nathanson even said: How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always ""5,000-10,000 deaths a year. I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose that others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics? The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.

Did he even say that?  Why do I care?  One person's opinion does not move me.  How about showing me some evidence on how many deaths there were per year?  Oh, right, you think there is no such evidence.

448,"Fair warning: I have strong opinions as an abortionist and as a proofreader.

&gt; Abortion is a very contentious issue in the American political sphere. There is a wide difference of opinions on the issue, many say it is an issue of privacy, life, or rights.

These are some hefty claims, but they are more obvious than they may seem.

""More obvious than they may seem"" is a bit of an odd turn of phrase.  Surely things that are obvious also seem obvious.

---

&gt;I want to first start by establishing some scientific fact. The most important fact is, a human zygote is composed of unique HUMAN cells 

A zygote is a single cell, it is not composed of cells at all.  It is composed of cell.

&gt; and unique DNA independent of the mother. 

This is true at the zygote stage, although later in pregnancy there will be maternal cells genetically identical to the fetus.

&gt; This very combination makes it genetically distinct from all other humans. (Mayo Clinic) 

Well, unless there is a twin.  Or unless I've cloned the mother.  I don't think those would change the humanity of this organism, and I suspect you agree -- so why is it part of your argument?

&gt; The zygote is a completely different human organism from the mother, and those who would say that it is no different from her appendix in that it is a part of her body that doesn’t contribute have a flawed scientific backing. 

This is a bit of proof by intimidation, plus some ad hominem vs strawman.  Your statement that it is a different organism is an analytic statement, not a synthetic statement -- it's a matter of the definition of an organism.  As such, it doesn't have moral weight, unless you attach some meaning to the *reasons* scientists defined an organism as starting at fertilization.

""Those who say"" it is no different from her appendix are clearly using the phrase ""no different"" loosely, i.e., ""no different with respect to moral weight.""  So when you say they lack scientific backing, you show that you lack the ability to take the perspective of others.  Clearly ""those who say"" understand that the zygote is not a part of the gastrointestinal tract.

&gt; We understand that all 46 chromosomes are present in the zygote and that they are unique to the zygote.

Again, do you not think that zygotes with aneuploidy are people?  Or that if they have a twin they are not people?  If it is not necessary to your argument, why is it in here?

&gt; Science is progressing extremely fast and gender can now be determined from a simple blood test of a pregnant woman who is 12 weeks along. (Doctor Testimony) Not only gender, but researchers have found every single trait that chromosomes design for a human in the earliest stages of pregnancies. 

Bit of a garden path sentence between ""researchers"" and ""pregnancies.""  I initially read it ""researchers have found [I assumed an implicit ""that"" here] every single trait that chromosomes design for [I expected a verb here] a human"".  To be honest, I'm still not sure how it's meant to be read.

Gender can't be determined from a zygote.  But genetic sex can.  It can be determined from a single cell removed from the zygote at the 8-cell stage, why bring up 12 weeks?  Also, it's a little circular.  If all the genetic material is present at fertilization, why make it sound like a big discovery that, for every trait that genes code for, the genes that code for it are present ""at the earliest stages"" of pregnancies.  Confusing.

&gt; That would have astounded scientists from the turn of the 21st century and as science progresses more evidence for choosing life abounds.  But even with all this new and convincing evidence, we can fall back on some old tried and true principles. 

Wait, why is the fact that sex can be determined from a zygote evidence for choosing life?  Why is the fact that it would have astounded scientists evidence?

Oh, right.  Because you're writing this for the pro-life perspective.

Stuff like this makes it feel like a masturbatory exercise.

&gt; The four basic principles of life are organization, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction. The human embryo can meet all of these standards with ease. I would also beg the question, can we use the reverse standard of death, to form a standard of life? Examining further, to be clinically dead, your heart must stop, then would the formation of a heart perhaps mark life? Well, if so, the heart begins to beat on the 22nd DAY of pregnancy, rendering large amounts of abortions murder by that standard ALONE, our previous standards withstanding. But to form a more rigorous definition of death, physicians will often use the stoppage of all brain activity as medically dead. Again, this standard alone would render Embryos life after the 40th day, when brain waves start. (Mayo Clinic) But with those basic principles determined, let’s look at the testimony of trained OBGYNs and Biologists. The first few individuals I’d like to discuss are Professors at the Science departments of well-respected universities. These people stood in front of the Senate and testified their views on life. Micheline Matthews-Roth, who teaches at Harvard, says this: I oppose the use of embryonic stem cells because to obtain those cells it is necessary to kill a growing human being. We know from embryology that a new life begins with the formation of the zygote, the cell formed by the union of egg and sperm in fertilization -- this is scientific fact, not religious doctrine. What makes us human is not our looks or mental attributes, but the human chromosomes and genes which we have in our cells from the zygote stage throughout our life. We should not condone killing a member of our species, even for a good reason. (NPR) That pretty much confirms the facts stated above. However, there is more, Dr. Alfred Bongiovanni said this : I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.... I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life.... I am no more prepared to say that these early stages [of development in the womb] represent an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the child prior to the dramatic effects of puberty...is not a human being. This is human life at every stage. (NAAPC) Jerome Lejeune, often considered the Father of Modern Genetics, said To accept the fact that, after fertilization has taken place, a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion. The human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical conception. It is plain experimental evidence. (NAAPC) I could go on with that exact same philosophy repeated out of the mouths of at least 5 more world renowned scientists who have made such statements, but I think the point is perceived.

No major objections.  Yeah, a fetus is a living human organism.  I don't find this to have moral significance.

Maybe replace ""stoppage"" with ""cessation.""

&gt; But, there is one final medical reason for the abolition of abortion. To this I refer to Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the co-founder of NARAL, the largest pro-abort political action group, and Abby Johnson the former Director of Planned Parenthood. 

False, she was the clinic director of a PP clinic, not director of PP.

&gt; Scientific fact says, fetuses can feel pain and react to their surroundings.

Citation needed.

&gt; Neither of the Former Pro-Abortionists believed this. Pro-Choicers will often say that reactions from babies in the womb are not available until 26 week, this has been disproven as above, but it wasn’t until the Now Pro-Life abortion Doctors experienced their first ultrasound abortion. 

Wait, so are you calling us pro-choicers or pro-abort?  Pick one.

Also ""this has been disproven as above,"" you didn't disprove it above.

It wasn't disproven until those abortion doctors experienced their first ultrasound abortion?  Sounds like you forgot to finish the sentence.

&gt; Early in the 70s, ultrasounds were just being developed, as the first one rolled into Dr. Nathanson’s office, he was thrilled to witness his work. As his colleague began, all that changed. He watched as the baby was pulled apart, he went on to write his book “Aborting America” in which he said, “I am responsible for the death of 60,000” and called abortions “humanity’s greatest holocaust”. He made the film “The Silent Scream” to highlight the process of abortions and what really happens during the process of ending a pregnancy. Little did he know that 40 years later a young woman would experience much the same. As Director Johnson was pulled in to assist on an abortion, she noticed an ultrasound, she didn’t give it much mind, she had never seen an abortion performed, but as the abortion started she saw a fetus pop onto it, she the 13 week old bouncing and swimming away from the forceps that was chasing it like a mad dog locked onto its prey, the fetus fought but lost, as the tool sucked the child apart the child limb from limb. Director Johnson resigned that day and never went back. (Abby Johnson)

In the end it doesn't matter what you say in the article or what you think, there are two major things wrong with anti-choice views (including yours) which can be summed up by saying ""one size doesn't fit all"":

1) You are trying to impose your (conservative) Christian views on everyone. This country has no national religion, therefore you shouldn't bring up religion when discussing laws. It weakens your argument. 
2) You want to create a law that doesn't take into account people's (or society's) best interests. I have a friend who had complications with her pregnancy. Because of this she was at risk and she found out her baby was not going to live. Because of her state's strict abortion laws she was forced to put her life at risk and carry on with the pregnancy.  Not allowing abortion in cases of rape and incest is also insane. Hardcore anti-choice people often do not want to allow provisions for this which is just asinine. 

I also want to be clear. You are not ""pro-life"" you are anti-choice. A lot of the time an abortion is the correct thing to do for the parents, for the siblings, for the family.   The US doing things like cutting off abortion aid for foreign countries is one of the cruelest things I can think of and leads to situations such as the one in this image. http://bit.ly/2xp77YW

450,"Absolutely. I believe the post mentioned something about the dangers of abortion to the mother as well, but we know that abortions are currently safer than childbirth. I know several women who had lasting health problems from giving birth who aren't even considered high risks. ",18,1503862119,2017-08-27 15:28:39
451,I would also add the countless possibilities of health risks a fetus can pose to the mother's life. Why should the life of the fetus be preserved and valued over a grown woman's when there are risks or issues that would be detrimental to that woman's life?,27,1503861488,2017-08-27 15:18:08
452,"So this was a very long post and I didn't read it all, but some points to consider:
You discussed that fetuses are unique and complicated beings, but so are most of the animals that roam the earth now. Would you support a ban on all meat and animal products? Or shutting down any business that causes habitat destruction (pretty much all businesses)? Would you never euthanize an animal when it's ill (more for fetuses that would have health problems or a poor quality of life due to their parents living situation)? Every human being born in a developed country also causes a massive toll on the environment, which causes unique, intelligent, and developed lifeforms to suffer and die. 
I also have a difficult time understanding the argument for fetuses potentially feeling pain. Even if they are at a point where they would feel pain, birth is also painful. They would also feel pain throughout their life if their life wasn't terminated, particularly for fetuses aborted because of potential health/genetic issues or lack of resources to care for the child. In comparison, abortion is very quick and potentially causes less suffering than living. Again, we have much more developed animals, such as pigs (who are as self aware and intelligent as a 3 year old human child) who we put through immense pain and suffering throughout months, just for our own pleasure.

Well, that's not true.  The vasculature of the brain is part of the brain, and it could still be working.  CSF could still be produced.

I also think that people who only have brainstem function remaining... well, if I only had brainstem function remaining without a chance for return of higher function, I would not wish to be considered a person any longer.

There is no such difference*, except the difference between whether or not the person being kept alive by machines meets the criteria for brain death.  I feel this makes your argument circular in this small area.

You can't use this machine support/living difference to distinguish between the dead and alive if the way you distinguish between machine support and machine living is whether the person is dead or alive.

.* People who need machines to live, of course, run a whole gamut.  If you tell me somebody needs hemodialysis and nothing else, I will be reasonably confident that this person is not brain-dead.

From what I've heard, machines are sometimes used to retain the body's organs for transplant at times after brain death; merely keeping their body alive and ""fresh"". I have opinions on that, but they are not exactly on topic so I'll refrain but the difference I believe is that the human being who has brain death is dead.

It's also a little weird to evaluate in utero.  I mean, an acardiac twin actually needs zero organs to stay alive.  Being hooked up to a placenta does wonders for reducing your ""number of organs required to stay alive"" count.  Unless we're counting maternal organs as well?

I notice a tendency in your discussion to go to what things are called; I'd encourage you (for this discussion and others) to think less about what things are called and more about what things are.  To call something a defect implies that something else is better.  We are all the sum of our ancestors' defects, in a way!

A twinning event takes one genetically consistent mass of cells (usually called one organism) and produces two -- one blastocyst becomes two.  When this split occurs more than 21 days after fertilization, it can't occur completely, and we get one mass of cells acting like two masses of cells with a connection.  The end effect of this may appear aesthetically like either two people with a shared *something*, or it may appear as one person with a *defect*... that's my point.

So I agree it sounds more like one conjoined twin is a person with a defect, and the other is a pair of twins that didn't complete, but biologically the only difference is which end the twinning started at.  (Or a small handful of other ways a ""parasitic twin"" can develop.)

It sounds elsewhere in your argument like you've shifted your thinking, more on that in a moment.

&gt; Yes I agree the brain is important. However I think there's a distinction between brain death and brain development. Brain death uses multiple modalities and at least two MDs to ensure there is no functioning part of the brain left;

Well, they check to make sure several parts of the brain aren't working.  It would be a little difficult to know that there is no functioning part of the brain left.  In general, the effects that cause the death of very basic parts of the brain also cause the rest of the brain to die.  However, could a mad scientist simulate these effects while leaving the forebrain completely intact, just disconnected?  Hypothetically, sure.

This is not a realistic concern, to be sure.  I bring it up to illustrate the importance of distinguishing between what we call things and what they actually are.

---

&gt; With fetal development, their neurons don't start ""firing"" until a few months into development.There is a huge difference between neurons that have stopped functioning and neurons that are functioning but not firing yet. In the latter example, the brain-stem is developing- in the latter, it is already supposed to be firing. So perhaps it does depend on developmental issues, but it also depends on what is appropriate for that stage. 

I have thoughts about this, but let's not get there yet.  We're using conjoined twins and anencephalic neonates to discuss whether or not it's important to *have* a brain to be a person.

485,"&gt;I remain somewhat confused about what you mean by this. I think precise language is very important here. The fingernails and hair ""growing"" phenomenon is actually just the tissue relaxing on the part of fingernails and hair that is covered by skin, and so it appears to grow, but no additional keratin is produced.

That's interesting, I appreciate your input on that. I always heard that your fingernails and hair are the result of dead cells piling up, so I didn't know that.

&gt;Additionally, in the case of cardiac death, all of your cells (except for, for a while, your gut bacteria) die. They don't all die at the same time. I think it's important to realize that biology doesn't contain firm boundaries for most things. Biology is fuzzy and squishy.

I agree. Though technically your body cells can survive for a tiny amount of time after the human(or animal) dies. The cells don't really die untill they are out of oxygen, which is carried to them with the blood. So the blood flowing around the body on the very last heartbeats is still providing oxygen for the cells as usual until the blood doesn't have any more oxygen. And there are types of stem cells according to some articles I've read, that can survive a bit longer (not quite the same, but similar enough that I thought a mention would be useful).

&gt;I understand your discomfort. I share it to an extent. I think that it's a good discomfort to have -- that's the discomfort that keeps us from being Bad in various other ways. I think that, for the subject of abortion, we can't let that discomfort dominate the conversation. We have to examine why it makes us uncomfortable, and ask if the reasons for that discomfort really apply to embryos and fetuses. (IMO.)

For me, it is that human beings should have equal rights under the law. Having equal rights does not mean everyone is EQUAL in terms of ability, strengths, weakness, etc- it means that we all possess the same rights. You might be smarter more honest, more courageous, more creative, etc etc. We are equal in worth and dignity, that's all. Basic human rights is spiritual equality, not physical.

&gt;The cardiac twin and acardiac twin are both human organisms. They both have multiple organ systems. They may be genetically ""identical"" (save for small mutations that have occurred in each after splitting), like identical twins. One is reliant on the heart of the other in order to continue being biologically alive, but they are seperate.

&gt;While you're thinking about it, also think about the case of a partial split, the process that creates conjoined twins. When it's a split that creates two heads (like the Hensel twins), we call them two people. When it's a split that creates two bottoms (i.e., a parasitic twin, like Frank Lentini), we call them one person.

I would also hesitate to calling a human organism that has split to create a bottom but to extra ""top"" two different human organisms as well. It sounds more like a defect in fetal development (hence the extra limbs or genitiala) than what we would call ""twinning."" 

&gt; I think that's a significant difference that speaks to the importance of a brain for personhood.

Yes I agree the brain is important. However I think there's a distinction between brain death and brain development. Brain death uses multiple modalities and at least two MDs to ensure there is no functioning part of the brain left; in other words, we don't actually know but we do several things to verify before we say someone is dead and cut off the lifeline of the body. With fetal development, their neurons don't start ""firing"" until a few months into development.There is a huge difference between neurons that have stopped functioning and neurons that are functioning but not firing yet. In the latter example, the brain-stem is developing- in the latter, it is already supposed to be firing. So perhaps it does depend on developmental issues, but it also depends on what is appropriate for that stage.

9,"&gt; It's murder if anyone else does.

To further clarify - it's murder if anyone else ends her pregnancy against her will and she decides to press charges.

The entire concept of murder is because people decide it is.

Since a pregnancy can have no value until a pregnant woman decides it has value to her, she is the only one who can decide if someone else murdered it or not. (she has to prove someone terminated her pregnancy against her will in a court of law before it will be declared murder - if she doesn't press charges, the state won't press charges either but they would in a regular murder case even if no one else did)

If she is unable to decide (dead, coma without prior declarations, etc), the law's default is that she wanted to remain pregnant until proven otherwise in a court of law.

Personally, I think the charge of murder is silly, since only people can be murdered.  The charges should be attempted assault if she doesn't sustain harm on herself or assault if she sustains harm on herself with the addition of wrongful fetal termination if she aborts as a result or fetal assault if the pregnancy is damaged in someway but not aborted or attempted fetal assault of it's clear they were trying to harm her pregnancy but failed to do so.",13,1501160591,2017-07-27 09:03:11

11,"Excellent article.  The only thing I take up is the whole distinction of ""what constitutes pregnancy"" thing.  Obviously, in medical terms, pregnancy is defined by implantation- that's the means by which it is detectable.  But I also think that there's room for- or we should make space for- people who have personal moral concerns about the idea of preventing implantation that might have otherwise taken place.  Which is not to say that hormonal birth control does so- the vast and overwhelming evidence is that contraception does exactly as its name implies, preventing conception- but rather that dismissing people's concerns is a bad move, in my opinion.

People who believe that a fertilized egg has moral value should have the facts in front of them, instead of becoming immediately skeptical of hormonal birth control because they think pro-choicers are arbitrarily trying to redefine ""pregnancy"" in order to get them to take abortifacients.

I remember reading a compelling argument from Amanda Marcotte once that pointed out how a woman *not* using hormonal birth control would be more likely to shed/menstruate fertilized eggs than one using birth control, precisely because she would have less chance of fertilized eggs in the first place.  That is an excellent argument- one that respects someone's personal moral views and offers up a reasoned explanation for them to make the decision they deem best.",3,1501118259,2017-07-26 21:17:39

72,"&gt;The word ""sufficient"" seems to be crucial to both your definitions of human being, yet that is imprecise and subjective.

It's impercise because it's a RELATIVE, but you are incorrect to call it subjective. Once conditions are set (ie point to any living entity) the entity can be objectively evaluated according to these terms. 

&gt;I found the stress on *past* acquisition of personhood interesting. There doesn't seem to be a compelling, objective, and non-arbitrary reason to include that in one's definition of human being, unless you intend to exclude preborn persons from your definition of human being, while not allowing for the exclusion of people asleep, unconscious, in a coma, etc. That would seem to be assuming the very thing you're trying to support with this definition.

Yes, and those are compelling, objective, and non-arbitrary reasons conditions any definition of ""human being"" or ""person"" would need to account for in this debate.

&gt;Given the lack of precision in terms, I found your final paragraph confusing. I assumed a link between person and personhood, but there they seem unlinked. You link humanity (being a human being) to personhood, and define person as involving the capacity for advanced cognitive functions.

No, not entirely. I define ""person"" as an entity with (assumed) sufficient potentiality for abstract reasoning. Or something along those lines. I'm also on mobile.
It's a POTENTIALITY, not an ACTUALITY. People who are mentally retarded an born babies are still people to some degree under my definition by virtue of the fact that we assume them to have some present or future capacity for abstract reasoning. They don't need to exercise this capacity in actuality in order to be considered persons. I hope that clears up what I mean here. I'm capitalizing words for emphasis. Understanding how potentiality works is essential to understanding my position. There are past, present, and future potentialities and then there are actualities. My broken laptop had the potential to access the internet in the past. My current laptop has the potential to access the internet in the present, and when the battery dies it has the potential to access the internet in the future.

&gt;You then suggest that fetuses after approximately 25 weeks of gestation would be human beings. This doesn't seem to agree with your prior reasoning. While there is brain activity, many animals display higher cognitive functioning and reasoning ability than a fetus at any level of development. Are these animals persons?

Whether or not animals such as primates (roughly speaking) are persons is debatable. In all likelihood they can probably be classified as sub-persons by the metrics I'm using to categorize and classify entities according to ""sufficient potentiality."" Some people may say non-human animals don't have sufficient potentiality for abstract reasoning, some people may say that they do. It depends on what we consider ""abstract reasoning"" to be and how we derive ""sufficient potentiality"" for it. This is why I contend that ""sufficient potentiality"" is something that is ASSUMED rather than observed empirically or quantified. For example, it's probably safe to say that all human persons/beings can be assumed to have a sufficient potentiality to do basic arithmetic and that all non-human animals do not have this same assumed potential.

&gt;I don't think the definition from genetics means what you think it does. It doesn't define the exact configuration of one's genes, and exclude from humanity anyone with a mutation or aberrations, or *almost* include chimpanzees. Genetically (scientifically), a human being is human because they were generated as the result of combining genetic material from two human progenitors.

Yes, but words have meanings and that reasoning is circular, thus it doesn't actually tell me what a ""human being"" is. In 200,000 years the human genome will be significantly different than it is today. It would be scientifically/logically accurate to call these evolved human beings something other than ""human beings"" if it is to be stated that todays human genome determine what is and what is not human. Philosophy favors universal truths, and thus philosophically it is still correct to call evolved human beings, human beings, because the essential property of the human being is ""humanity,"" not a specific genetic sequence. What humanity is is probably a subject for a different discussion.

&gt;The more I read through it, the more confusing it is. You're clearly drawing a distinction between human and being a person, in that you can be either one without being the other. For example artificial intelligence could be a person but not a human, or a dead person could be human but not a person.

Correct. 

&gt;However, you include the past acquisition of personhood in your definition of human.

Not to nitpick over semantics, but I include the past acquisition of personhood in my definition of ""human being"" not my definition of ""human."" You can truthfully state that a fetus is human by my definitions. You cannot truthfully state that a fetus is a human being. The only way you can do do that I can think of is by redefining ""being"" to refer to something that exists materially in some form or another. That definition still falls short of describing what a ""human"" is and it is not clear to me that it can be used to construct an argument in favor of abortion prohibitionism.

&gt;It simply seems simpler and more logical to agree with the science of the matter and conclude that a human being is that organism which results from the combining of genetic material from two other human beings.

That's simple but not logical as the reasoning is circular. Still, this is not an argument as much as it is a statement of preference.

&gt;Questions of ""personhood"" are moral and philosophical questions that science can't provide any input on.

I disagree. Science can help us determine what the essential property if ""personhood"" is as that property pertains to all things that are said to be living. It has to do with sustained regular/normative brain function. For example, plants are living but not people. It is when we examine other forms of life that ""personhood"" becomes a little more complicated, because ""life"" is both a philosophical and scientific phenomena.

&gt;For example, science may be able to tell us to a rigorous and minute detail the level of cognitive or brain function that any given organism is capable of, but it can't possibly tell us the value that we should place on what level of cognitive ability, or at what level of this cognitive ability we can consider an organism a person. That is a value judgment that we arrive at from philosophical and moral reasoning.

I agree, but as implied above, science helps us formulate a value structure by virtue of it being able to be used to differentiate between different forms of life. Plants and animals have different moral values associated with them, roughly speaking. 

&gt;Therefore, the only rational, equitable, and moral thing to do is to treat all human beings with the same dignity and respect as any other human being, regardless of skin, race, beliefs, or developmental stage, and grant them all the same human rights.

That's not an argument, and words have meanings. You cannot fundamentally make this assertion in a way that defends abortion prohibitionism without first defining what the terms ""human,"" ""human being,"" ""person,"" and ""rights"" mean amongst others. I also have my doubts that you can appeal to a scientific definition of ""humanity"" to construct a moral or philosophical argument. Science can't test moral truths. ""Abortion is immoral"" is just not a statement science can rule on.

&gt;Edit: formatting, curse you mobile! Also, I see this kind of statement from people on both sides of this and many other debates. Statements like adherence on the other side of an argument being fundamentally flawed in the reasoning or having obvious issues with their arguments. The insinuation being that these people are dimwit adults, though to your credit you didn't explicitly say that or appear to be trying to imply it. I would just like to ask you, in your opinion and experience, though you may disagree with their conclusions, who is the most persuasive or intelligent or honest or reasonable pro-life advocate you have ever heard or read? Who's arguments from the other side do you find most compelling, even if you disagree with them ultimately?

I generally find abortion prohibitionist arguments to be more confusing than compelling. Probably the one I find most confusing is the ""organismal argument."" I forget exactly how it goes, but it postulates that human beings are human organisms and fetuses are human organisms something something killing human organisms is wrong therefore abortion is wrong. IMO it's disingenuous in it's construction as it muddies the waters by using the term ""organism"" to draw a moral equivalency between two things that are not morally equivalent.

75,"- The word ""sufficient"" seems to be crucial to both your definitions of human being, yet that is imprecise and subjective.

- I found the stress on *past* acquisition of personhood interesting. There doesn't seem to be a compelling, objective, and non-arbitrary reason to include that in one's definition of human being, unless you intend to exclude preborn persons from your definition of human being, while not allowing for the exclusion of people asleep, unconscious, in a coma, etc. That would seem to be assuming the very thing you're trying to support with this definition. 

- Given the lack of precision in terms, I found your final paragraph confusing. I assumed a link between person and personhood, but there they seem unlinked. You link humanity (being a human being) to personhood, and define person as involving the capacity for advanced cognitive functions. You then suggest that fetuses after approximately 25 weeks of gestation would be human beings. This doesn't seem to agree with your prior reasoning. While there is brain activity, many animals display higher cognitive functioning and reasoning ability than a fetus at any level of development. Are these animals persons?

- I don't think the definition from genetics means what you think it does. It doesn't define the exact configuration of one's genes, and exclude from humanity anyone with a mutation or aberrations, or *almost* include chimpanzees. Genetically (scientifically), a human being is human because they were generated as the result of combining genetic material from two human progenitors. 

- The more I read through it, the more confusing it is. You're clearly drawing a distinction between human and being a person, in that you can be either one without being the other. For example artificial intelligence could be a person but not a human, or a dead person could be human but not a person. However, you include the past acquisition of personhood in your definition of human.

It simply seems simpler and more logical to agree with the science of the matter and conclude that a human being is that organism which results from the combining of genetic material from two other human beings. Questions of ""personhood"" are moral and philosophical questions that science can't provide any input on. For example, science may be able to tell us to a rigorous and minute detail the level of cognitive or brain function that any given organism is capable of, but it can't possibly tell us the value that we should place on what level of cognitive ability, or at what level of this cognitive ability we can consider an organism a person. That is a value judgment that we arrive at from philosophical and moral reasoning. Therefore, the only rational, equitable, and moral thing to do is to treat all human beings with the same dignity and respect as any other human being, regardless of skin, race, beliefs, or developmental stage, and grant them all the same human rights.

&gt; Also people pay for their private insurance theirselves so it shouldn't matter that a few people have some kind of objection to other people having sex for a purpose other than procreation.

If their insurance premiums go up to pay for abortions, that's unfair to them.

&gt;Honestly birth control is good for society since it lowers the number of unwanted children and abortion. 

I agree.

&gt;It doesn't make any sense for anti-choicers to be against providing birth control to teens and poor people, because it lowers the abortion rate. If they're so concerned about abortion they should be all for providing birth control and proper sex education.  

They still think it's immoral though, so why should they want to pay for it? The pill isn't expensive, condoms aren't expensive.

&gt;Because those things lower the abortion rate, if people don't get pregnant they don't need an abortion.  

Don't have sex, don't get abortions. Is the logic. 

&gt;Anti-choicers being against providing birth control would only make sense if their ultimate goal was to control people and punish them for having sex without wanting to procreate, instead of to lower the abortion rate.

I guess we shouldn't even have to pay taxes since a few people are personally against taxes.  In the end sometimes tax dollars go to things that some people are personally against.

Condoms can break easily, especially if people haven't been given proper sex education, and when they break people are left without any backup protection.  IUDs and Implants can cost you almost a thousand dollars.  And female sterilization can be quite pricy.

And no one is asking you to decide what other women can do with their own bodies. 

What we are asking is for you to think outside your box and consider whether you would logically and consistently hold to your viewpoint in morally similar situations.

I asked you earlier how would an abortion help a mother who is already in labor, given birth to one 36 week old twin and has contracted sepsis and you weren't even able or were unwilling to think about that. This kind of tells me that for whatever reason you haven't really taken the time to truly analyze you position. Maybe you are still young, maybe the fear mongering has made you deathly afraid of pregnancy or maybe you're just afraid to step out of your comfort zone. I'm not sure what it is. And I'm not here to argue. If you have no desire for open discussion then I won't push you. If you are ever ready feel free to message me.

210,"&gt;From the articles above Bei Bei Shaui was arrested in Indiana for attempting suicide while pregnant and had to serve 435 days in prison. 

Attempted suicide would also kill the baby.

&gt;22 year old Christine Taylor of Iowa was arrested and investigated for falling down the stairs while pregnant, though fortunately the prosecutors were not able to charge her and she made national news and was able to highlight the risk of possible imprisonment to pregnant women around the country. 

Investigation is not imprisonment. Seems a lot like using fringe cases for fear mongering. 

&gt;And in Mississippi, 15 year old Rennie Gibbs was arrested after having a stillbirth, while she had used cocaine, cocaine was not proven to be a factor in the stillbirth and doctors believe that the real cause was most likely an umbilical cord wrapped around the neck of the fetus. Fortunately charges against her were dropped, but only after a 7 year legal battle.
 
Again fear mongering, She was not charged. And yes, hopefully this case sets the precedence that you don’t use cocaine while you’re pregnant or you may end up on trial for a long time.

&gt;And in Latin America once again not all of the cases were of cocaine users giving birth and then abandoning the baby. Glenda Xiomara Cruz, also from El Salvador, had a stillbirth at a local hospital, the only evidence to point to it being intentional was a statement from her abusive partner stating that she caused the stillbirth. 

Again El Salvador is NOT a developed nation which is what we were talking about. 

&gt;Right, the Guardian is biased yet a ""pro-life"" website named 'savitatruth' is somehow an unbiased news source. What are you going to do post 'lifenews' next and tell us that they are unbiased. Lol.

I never mentioned the Guardian being biased btw, even though it is. And you can fact check every piece of info on the site I linked to. Every piece of information is factual. Did you bother to fact check?

&gt;Savita was not allowed to have an abortion to treat her miscarriage until after the fetal heartbeat stopped, by that time it was too late and the infection had already spread. 

Savita did not need an abortion. She needed early antibiotic intervention. Abortions WERE allowed in Ireland at the time for these cases.
 
 &gt;She was denied an abortion until after the fetal heartbeat stopped because the doctors said that they were in a ""pro-life"" country. 

She was denied an abortion way before she got sepsis. The problem arised later when the doctors did not do their job properly and missed the fact that she had sepsis. If they hadn’t missed the sepsis, they would have administered antibiotics as the next proper course of action (NOT given an abortion). And then continued to monitor her for next steps. The whole “prolife country” is just fear mongering propaganda. Ireland has HAD one of the highest maternal health rates under their prolife laws. See [here](http://www.thejournal.ie/maternal-deaths-mortality-rate-ireland-pro-life-campaign-statistics-2921139-Aug2016/). I’ve fact checked for you already since you seem to lazy to do it yourself. 

&gt;You're right, the doctors were negligent, they were negligent because they were in a ""pro-life"" country. 

Yeah sure, because doctors never make mistakes right. It’s all the prolife laws fault despite the high maternal health rate. Just because you say so.

&gt;Because in ""pro-life"" countries miscarrying fetuses are valued more than women.
 
Apparently that’s what you’ve been brainwashed to believe despite evidence to the contrary.

&gt;Though at least Ireland was forced to change their ""pro-life"" laws after her death. 

They actually didn’t really change much at all.

&gt;In Milluzzo's case she once again died because a ""pro-life"" doctor refused to perform an abortion and remove the final miscarrying fetus, once again because there was still a fetal heartbeat and its heartbeat was valued over her life.

LOL. Seriously are you twelve years old? Do you understand anything about pregnancy and childbirth? You can not perform an abortion on a 36 week old fetus as the mother is labouring. Do you realize what you are saying? 
Please if you do nothing else explain to me how a doctor would utilize abortion to help the mother in this situation? 

&gt;And you conveniently ignored the suicidal rape victim in Ireland who was denied an abortion at 8 weeks and then locked in a mental institution against her will until 25 weeks, at which time she was forcibly given a c-section. 

Because I don’t see how keeping a perfectly healthy woman from killing herself and her child is a bad thing? I say we reserve the killing for the rapist.

&gt;Her human rights and autonomy was stripped from her and she was turned into nothing more than an incubator by the so called ""pro-life"" country. 

So when Michelle Carter tells her boyfriend to kill himself she is deemed a monster and charged with manslaughter but, perish the idea that  we stop a mother from killing herself and her child.

&gt;You also conveniently ignored the pregnant rape victims of Mexico that were denied abortions, even when they were as young as 13 and 10.

I don’t consider Mexico a developed country.

&gt;I honestly don't see how highlighting the reality of life for women living under ""pro-life"" laws shuts down conversation. 

Because you are highlighting fringe cases mostly happening in underdeveloped, tyrannical countries with corrupt governments and backwards thinking in very biased and misleading ways.

&gt;These are real stories of real women living under real ""pro-life"" laws around the world.

These are rare stories that mostly happen in underdeveloped and tyrannical nations. Most of the women don’t even end up in jail and they are usually blown out of proportion.

I don’t deny that there are some countries that create prolife legislation that does not work. Usually in countries that already struggling with gender equality and tyrannical governments.
 
But the reality is that developed prolife nations like Ireland and Poland have always had the highest maternal rates, fair justice systems and exceptions for the health/life of the mother. Prolifers know these things. We know that prolife legislation if done properly works very well and keeps both mother and child safe. Highlighting stuff happening in places like El Salvador where there is corrupt government and tyranny does not help your case imo.

It’s one thing to have an intellectual conversation that opens doors so that prolifers and prochoicers can understand each other. But this just reeks of either intellectual laziness or complete dishonestly.

Please reread the article. It states that an abortion would not have been necessary in Milluzzo’s case because she was already miscarrying.

I’m not saying this to be rude but it’s these kinds of things that I think make prolifers not take prochoicers seriously. The articles are very skewed, extremely intellectually dishonest and just sheer fear mongering.

The prime example is the last article about the Italian doctor. The mother was already in labour and delivery. She was 36 weeks pregnant. That’s 8 months! How could an abortion help at that point? It’s like prochoicers think abortion is some magical fix to any problem that arises during pregnancy. I seriously don’t get it? Am I missing something because stuff like this really seems to shut down the conversation between the two camps and I don’t think that is a good thing.

It makes me want a child even less than I already do because it just confirms that even anti-choicers view pregnancy and babies as punishments for having sex for enjoyment and that they want to force those punishments on women who don't want them.  It just solidifies my belief that if I ever do become pregnant I will have an abortion because here is an anti-choicer, someone who is supposed to love babies and fetuses over everything else, saying that babies are really a burden and a punishment that women should be forced to take responsibility for.  

Abortion is taking responsibility for your actions.  If your birth control fails and you don't want to be pregnant you are taking responsibility by having an abortion.  

Like you said, children are a punishment and a burden that women are forced to have if they choose to have sex so why would choose to have one when there are other options?  It's humorous that you think admitting that you view children as a burden and an unwanted responsibility is going to make women want to have a few and to choose to not have an abortion.  It really has the opposite effect.  


Women chose abortion long before it made anyone money so it has nothing to do with money and no one said abortion was always the best option for every woman, only that it was an option for women that don't want to be pregnant for whatever reason.  Woman are individuals with individuals circumstances and individual beliefs, we are simply giving her options so she can choose what is best for her and her family.  We're not forcing women to have an abortion, we're telling them that that they are people with autonomy and that they are the ones that get to choose what they are going to do with their body and how many or few children they are going to have.

270,"Yet birth control still fails.  Yes some people are careless with their birth control, but it still fails and women still have a choice of what to do with their body.  And it doesn't matter that you see non-procreative sex as empty or joyless, most people don't.  Especially people who are childfree and refuse to ever have children.  Childfree people and people who are done having children aren't just going to stop having sex because you want to punish them for enjoying theirselves if their birth control happens to fail.  They're going to use birth control and have an abortion if they have to. ",2,1499360245,2017-07-06 12:57:25

You're framing them as some kind of horrible punishment for having sex.  Who would want that?  I certainly wouldn't want that kind of punishment.  Wanting an education and a career without having children does not make someone selfish.  Women can work and have children if they want, but they don't have to if they don't want to because they have choices.  Just because you see children as some sort of punishment for women having sex (being sluts?) does not mean other women have to choose to take their punishment.  ",2,1499359905,2017-07-06 12:51:45

By 18 weeks post-fertilization, pain receptors have appeared throughout the body.” (2003 medical textbook on maternal, fetal, and neonatal physiology)On early fetal response to painful stimuli: “The earliest reactions to painful stimuli motor reflexes can be detected at 7.5 weeks of gestations [5.5 weeks post-fertilization].” (2012 medical article)On fetal stress responses: “Multiple studies show that ‘the human fetus from 18-20 weeks elaborates pituitary-adrenal, sympatho-adrenal, and circulatory stress responses to physical insults.’” (2013 expert testimony before Congress of Dr. Maureen Condic, Director of Human Embryology instruction for the School of Medicine at the University of Utah)On fetal experience of pain being more intense than in adults: “Mechanisms that inhibit or moderate the experience of pain do not begin to develop until 32 to 34 weeks post-fertilization.

Also, childfree people like myself are not just going to remain celibate for life.  And married couples are not going to remain celibate when they don't want a child, some never want a child.  Abstinence and waiting until marriage and only having sex when you want a child doesn't work.  Actual sex education and easily accessible and cheap contraceptives drastically lower the rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions.  Though the number will never be zero because birth control can fail and not everyone is going to continue an unplanned pregnancy.

That's wishful thinking and not necessarily the case.

390,"In 2005, a systematic multi-disciplinary review of the evidence on fetal pain (reviewing 2,108 articles) was published by The Journal of the American Medical Association.  Their findings were that there is no evidence to suggest the ability for fetuses to feel pain before the third trimester.  You can read this review [here](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429).

Suffice to say, even if we wanted to discuss the scientific debate over late-term fetal pain, there is consensus over early-term fetal pain: it doesn't exist.  Period.  Only 1.3% of all abortions take place at 21 weeks or later (most of them due to extreme cases like anomalies incompatible with life), and the vast majority (88.8%) take place in the first trimester ([source](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states)), where everybody agrees that there is no brain structures in place yet to perceive pain.

Women seeking abortions due to lack of finances (your original post's main point) are typically not the people having abortions 20 weeks in; if you want to talk about preventing late-term abortions, the focus needs to be on helping abortions take place earlier (since most avoidable delays that push first-trimester abortions into the second trimester, for example, are related to obstacles to early access).",7,1499282960,2017-07-05 15:29:20
391,"Im fine with contraception. Helping women who are poor etc... I agree with all those points. So here is my question regarding pain.. Have you ever watched an abortion video and have you ever been to a neonatal intensive care unit to meet some of the 20 week old babies they save? Have you talked to the medical professionals who save these babies because I sure have. There will always be articles that state babies don't feel pain because it is more comfortable for people who have your belief to see these unborn humans as valid. Im also curious to see if you feel the same about unborn elephants who have protections? Its just interesting to me that you make such statements comfortably. If you haven't talked to medical professionals and watched a video of a baby trying to escape essentially sharp pliers to cut off its leg, then your point is invalid.",1,1499279025,2017-07-05 14:23:45
392,"I think a good strategy for folks opposed to abortion would be to identify which women would rather not abort if given the resources they need, and those for whom all the resources and offerings in the world aren't going to change their mind.

The idea that all woman are willing to continue a pregnancy to term if only they had more money or more help is naive, in my opinion.  Of course finances play a major part in reproductive decisions, but having a child touches on a lot of other things, too.  Rich and well-off women get abortions as well, and it's not because they don't have the means to provide.

If the anti-abortion folks are going to continue to focus on pregnant women (rather than helping women avoid pregnancy in the first place), a good starting point would at least be to stop wasting time on people who neither want nor need help for raising a child, and instead work with those who really would love to have a baby if the situation was different (and then be honest about how much help they can provide, because some diapers for the first few years is certainly not the same as financial stability for 18 years!).

Also, it bothers me that is has to be said, but no, fetuses are not screaming.  They do not feel pain, they do not have any consciousness or cognition or self-awareness.",6,1499278145,2017-07-05 14:09:05
393,"So here is the foundational difference between your perspective and mine. I fully believe a woman should have the right to be a mother or not. I however believe all humans born or unborn should have rights. If a woman does not want to pro create again I would encourage her to actively take responsibility to not become pregnant however that looks. I would encourage her to give her precious unborn child a chance at life by finding a couple to adopt. I had a friend last year (with zero income) become pregnant by accident and she went through the adoption process. She met the dreams of a young couple and gave her child a chance at life. I also believe we need foster care reform and child care reform.

How is it pro woman to make a woman kill her child to have a career and keep her life? There is something incredibly flawed with the idea that the unborn have no value until they pass through the a vaginal canal. There is also overwhelming proof babies feel everything. Im not sure if you have watched a late term abortion but it is worse than any horror film you could see, because it is real and it is incredibly violent. Why is abortion so shoved down women's throats as an option when it takes a life and for many women it actually causes life long issues. (I could send some articles on that point if you like)  Did you know once you become pregnant that babies  dna stays with you forever? Why would women make this choice for this innocent life that didn't ask to be inside of them? We were all unborn babies once. Also child care needs to be addressed. I always say the feminist movement forgot unborn girls and mothers. Ladies lets break the glass ceiling without killing our young. I challenge the notion that we're promoting women's rights when half of abortions, if not more are killing females.

Here's some stats from the Guardian. The UK is well behind other countries and still clocks in at 1 deaths per 12,000 live births. Italy is half that, Australia is close after that. These are all countries with abortion, so abortion isn't saving these women. ProLifers are also usually ok with abortion when the life of the mother is in danger.

&gt;In contrast, a legal medical abortion has a mortality rate of 1 in 100,000.

Well it actually has a 100% mortality rate, its literally killing a human. There are approximately 200,000 abortions in the UK each year, with 700,000 live births. That means that there is approximately 56 deaths in childbirth every year in the UK.

&gt; A decades-long struggle to give Northern Irish women access to terminations on the NHS in mainland Britain was unexpectedly won in the space of 24 hours on Thursday, as the UK government dramatically changed its policy in an attempt to head off a damaging Tory rebellion on the Queen&amp;#039;s speech.

&gt; Dozens of Conservative MPs were understood to have expressed to Tory whips their support for an amendment by the Labour MP Stella Creasy to allow Northern Irish women access to NHS-funded abortions in Great Britain.

&gt; The Department of Health had previously defended its policy not to fund abortions for Northern Irish women in England, arguing in court that to do so would undermine Stormont.

432,"&gt;A fetus becomes a child when it is born. 

See [1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/child). See [4](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/child?s=t).

&gt;So... Abortion leaves me a parent to a dead fetus 

Not by biological definition though.

&gt;(again, I wouldn't call that parenthood but we can if you want). 

Ok but it doesn't really matter what you personally would call it. Words have definitions and meaning.

&gt;And killing an actual child is wrong. At that point, adoption is really the only option.

Do you mean at birth? If so, why is it wrong? What is the moral difference between killing a born child versus an unborn child?

&gt;Of course I'm a proponent of bodily autonomy. But it's not the only reason abortion needs to be available.

I don't think the bodily autonomy argument really withstands prolife rhetoric except in the case of victims of rape.

&gt;I don't care whether the fetus is a person or not. Generally it's not relevant.

I haven't seen one BA argument that is held consistently in similar moral situations and if they are the consequences are atrocities.

436,"It really seems like you are being argumentative simply for the sake of being argumentative.   As per standard practice now, it's the insurance of the adoptive parents that cover the medical costs for the women who chooses to give her baby up for adoption.  So if the women chooses to have this procedure, whomever signs up to adopt the embryo/fetus will be covering all medical costs through their insurance.  Otherwise the state becomes responsible because they've decided that ""all life is precious""

Or to simplify it even more, what if a pill was invented that causes an intact embryo to detach and we have the technology to incubate it to term.  The pill causes no side affects to mother or fetus.  Now, a women decides to end her pregnancy, she takes this pill, does she have rights to the fetus once it's outside her body, or are we as a society responsible for doing our best to help it survive?",1,1498777507,2017-06-29 19:05:07

444,"&gt; I don't know that I'd call a fetus ""offspring,"" but if you want to then sure. I should have the right to kill a fetus that is using my womb.

Biology dictates that they are.

&gt; We have different definitions of the word parent. To me, it means someone who has had a child. A fetus is not a child in any way.

I was clearly using the biological definition as I noted in my response.

&gt; Even if I conceded that having an abortion still leaves me a parent, it's better than being a parent to a living child.

Abortion would leave you a parent of a dead child. I am sure that there are many parents of living children who want to rid themselves of the responsibility but killing them is not a humane option whether they are living in your home or in your womb. There are more humane options.

I suspect you aren't a proponent of the bodily autonomy argument anyway. It sounds like yours is more of the fetus is not a person mentality.

456,"Insulting me and my partner isn't an argument you know. Neither is calling me a troll. Refusal to listen does not make you right. It makes you closed minded, which does not lend itself to the truth, or to rational discussion.

I have no intention of forcing anyone to remain pregnant but neither does my partner have any intention of ever aborting a fetus. Those are our decisions. That doesn't mean I have to morally approve of their actions or can't demand they present an argument to back up their moral beliefs. If you can't justify or even argue for your belief why should I respect It? It's intellectually lazy and cowardly. I hope you're better than that.

A child is simply a young human. So is a fetus. 

Is a parasite part of a woman's body? I say it isn't, it needs to be more than attached and inside her for it to be a part of her. If it isn't part of her body it has its own bodily autonomy. Just because it can't exercise control over it's autonomy doesn't mean it doesn't have it. Just like a newborn can not exercise it's own autonomy. 

Attachment and position are not sufficient to claim a fetus is part of your body. If it isn't part of your body it must have autonomy which must be respected. Just as a baby's is.

You have repeated failed to incorporate these points into your argument. If you're right you should be able to argue your position. Instead you repeat the same line over and over again before insulting me. Hardly compelling rhetoric. ",1,1498746191,2017-06-29 10:23:11

0,"&gt;Your child doesn’t have that right. You can send him/her to boarding school or to live with other family members. Your assumption is what makes the difference- a child has other places to go, a fetus does not. That’s the crux of the issue!

You must have purposefully ignored me when I said 

&gt; (And let's assume, for the sake of this scenario, that there is no other place the child can go)

Let's assume this lasts nine months. Should she be allowed to kill her child?

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silent_Scream#Medical_community 

Your source is Wikipedia, aka a research paper. They gathered sources and cited them. One of their conflicts is that they talk about ""current theories of pain and fetal development"", but the Wikipedia page was last updated **3 months ago**, and their references were really old, all of the sources under ""medical community"" from 1985.

I searched for the video I meant to show you, but it has been deleted for ""violating YouTube's guidelines."" 

&gt; I can tell you my newborn wouldn’t have been physically capable of trying to avoid anything, lol. A fetus wouldn’t be able to- they don’t have the neurological development.

This is flat out false. The Mayo Clinic says that 3 weeks after fertilization, the embryo begins developing its brain, spinal cord, heart, and other organs [here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302). 

At 28 weeks - just after abortion is illegal, the fetus has brain waves and REM sleep. But at 8 weeks it moves and has a sense of touch(and can feel pain). They swallow and have taste at 16 weeks. Clearly there is an experience going on there. While abortion is still legal, the inner ear forms and they react to sounds outside of the womb. So there is enough brain structure there to have an experience.

[this](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865585688/The-disputed-science-of-fetal-pain.html)interview of doctors explain a different side of the same debate. Even the critics in several medical journals that I have read admit various pain stages while ultimately sticking with a later gestational date, arguing that the later date is *real pain*.They all admit that the sense of touch develops early, and that the unborn move away from needles and release stress hormones after needle punctures- but they continue to argue that it isn't *real pain*.

&gt;Again, born children have options fetuses do not.

Already responded above.

/u/socialworker80 has a an argument against the bodily autonomy = the right to kill my child. She says:

&gt;The flaws in the bodily autonomy argument in the context of abortion are for one if you look up the definition of autonomy, it can easily be argued that children, employees, the developmentally disabled, and the elderly with dementia, are not autonomous. These groups I have mentioned do not have bodily autonomy either (well employees would in this example) because they don't have, or have limited self determination over their bodies. These groups still clearly have human rights. They are still people. And human rights definitions say that such rights can't be denied based on status because they are inalienable. These definitions say that every human is entitled to human rights simply because they are human. The unborn are clearly human. Being unborn is just a status. Abortion is a human rights violation. 

&gt;I'm not sure if this came across- my daughter was very much a planned pregnancy. In fact we had to use infertility treatment to conceive. She was made with iui, not sex :) And it was still very stressful to commit to actually having her!

I don't think you mentioned it, but Inthink what I said still holds relevance because you to an extent took actions (using infertility treatment) that resulted in her conception. You told me it was hard and you had self-doubt issues because of it, as well as having second thoughts - however you choose to own up to the responsibility of being a mother and carried to term (and unless I am still wrong, took/are taking care of her until she is an adult). That to me is what true responsibility means.

&gt;You talk about it with them, for whatever reason mental health care is inaccessible. You aren’t at fault if you child commits suicide.

But this wasn't your original argument. Your original argument was that parents shouldn't have to take any steps to even try to prevent their child's death, or help them in any way.

&gt;True, and there are cases of the courts intervening and overriding parents’ decisions. But generally speaking parents make decisions for kids, even life or death medical decisions. Here’s a link about chemo and one about premies.

Thank you.

&gt;True, and there are cases of the courts intervening and overriding parents’ decisions. But generally speaking parents make decisions for kids, even life or death medical decisions. Here’s a link about chemo and one about premies.

Thank you. But do you believe that? That a parent should hold his or her child's life in their hands? That the child should not be allowed to survive if they choose otherwise? 

&gt;This is from your article “The vast majority of parents who kill their children go to prison rather than mental institutions.” So most people who kill their kids aren’t mentally ill, at least not to a court of law. Do you still maintain that women who want to abort are mentally ill and shouldn’t be allowed to make that decision for themselves?

See /u/socialworker80's post below.

&gt;But you do, apparently. Unless you’re from the “the only moral abortion is my abortion” school of thought.

Here's the thing: I don't think abortion should even be a right, except in the life of the mother scenario, which makes up &gt;1% of all abortions. The reason I support this scenario is because I am prolife. If only one life can be saved, it needs to be saved. I regret the tragic loss of life that is the baby, but better one saved than none at all.",0,1496023077,2017-05-28 21:57:57
1,"Agreed.  Look, as someone who supports the right to abortion, I get the anger- it sucks that one side got the sunny awesome-sounding name that subtly suggests any opponents are ""pro-death"".  It's anger-inducing- you want to take 'em to task and point out hypocrisy (real or perceived) in the moniker.  But the simple fact is that ""pro-life"" just means ""opposes abortion and/or abortion rights"".  Just like ""pro-choice"" means ""supports the choice and right to abortion"".  Yes, I'd like to see more neutral terms to describe us both without the heavy emotional weight of their connotations.  But in the meantime, it is what it is.

I'm reminded of that quote from Joan Chittister that a lot of pro-choicers for some reason like to trot out, about how opposing abortion without supporting X, Y, and Z causes (poverty, education, housing, etc.), is not pro-life.  It always riles me up, because, taken to its logical conclusion (as far as I can see it), is that I should be happy with a very progressive and liberal socialist who opposes abortion while simultaneously demanding good quality of life for all . . . as if the problem is the hypocrisy or narrow fetal focus, rather than, ya know, the fact that they want to criminalize and stigmatize abortion.",2,1496010846,2017-05-28 18:34:06

1/ Every single pregnancy has wide ranging impacts on the health of the mother. Saying that pregnancy has nothing to do with the health of the mother is willfully ignorant. But I did not state that pregnancy is not physically tasking, or that it has nothing to do with the health or life of the mother. [96%](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html) of abortions have nothing to do wth medical reasons.

2/ The point of my analogy was to compare dragging a person into your house knowing they would affect your health or bodily autonomy, yet you choose to do it anyway, knowing if you change your mind you will kill an innocent person who had no say in whether they come in contact with your autonomy or not, perhaps even affecting your health, and to translate that into an abortion situation. 

3/ Abortion rates are correlated with higher maternal rates than regular pregnancy, see [here](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-11/mi-tca110614.php) and [here](http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrea-mrozek-if-abortion-saves-lives-whats-happening-in-chile). So banning abortions (making exceptions only for life of the mother) would be a benefit, not a danger. 

4/ needing to be hospitalized for a few days after pregnancy isn't necessarily a requirement to having been pregnant. My mother had a homebirth six times(including the miscarriage of my sister due to early labour and not once did she need to be hospitalized.)

5/ I am not denying that childbirth is painless. And urinary incontinence can occur after abortion due to the bladder getting used to the uterus not being on top of it.

&gt;I’m sorry to hear about your sister. I think the doctors who do abortions would be just as fine with inducing early on an ethical level. It’s not as safe to the mother, so they kill the fetus first since it’s going to end up dead anyway. I don’t see how you can argue that it’s any different on a practical or ethical level. In fact, they give a drug that blocks progesterone receptors during abortions, which is, in effect, inducing labor early.

Of course no one wants a woman harmed. I have never met a pro life person who disagreed with the potential for induction for miscarriage/delivery of any unborn threatening a woman's life. They can leave the womb with more dignity than a surgical abortion, in the cases that is possible. 

Have you ever heard of partial birth abortion? The abortionist pulls the baby out until it's head is the only part of it in the womb. The abortionist stabs the scissors into the base of the baby’s skull. The scissors are spread to enlarge the opening. The suction catheter is then inserted and the brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The remains of the baby's head slides out easily, and the abortionist knows that his or her work is done. I know this procedure was outlawed in the US in 2008, but it's worth mentioning that this is just one of the ways abortion is preformed. For example in the situation you cited, D&amp;E, D&amp;C and D&amp;X would be most likely to be preformed. At those points, babies have long ago developed a nervous system, brain, etc. They will be able to feel the abortionist killing them. Abortion isn't a painless operation.

&gt;Is it an ordinary need to live inside of someone else’s body? What needs do children have that can’t be met by a non-parent adult?

For the unborn child, yes. There is no other place it can live. The uterus is designed for the very use. It is intellectually dishonest to argue otherwise, even if you personally don't want a child in your uterus. If you do not want a child, you should have your uterus removed.

&gt;http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/pregnancy-your-first-trimester The first trimester goes through the end of the 12th week. This is the point when the risk for miscarriages drops significantly, and miscarriages after that are late. However late term abortion is an unrelated term, referring to abortions after 20 weeks.

*typo. I'm on mobile. Some people say “late-term” abortion should only include abortions at or after 20 weeks gestation. I’ve only been able to find reasons for abortions at or after 13-16 weeks data, which is slightly different. One could argue that the proportion of medically necessary abortions after 16/20 weeks would be higher.
However there’s no indication it would be so high as to constitute even a majority of late-term abortions, much less “nearly all” late-term abortions. 

&gt;This is your opinion, but the law doesn’t agree with you. We don’t punish people who take risks by making them live with the outcome regardless of our ability to help them.

That's because a) the law can be wrong and b) most situations where we risk something doesn't hang another person's life in the balance. So you will accept that abortion is immoral and violates the rights of a fetus when it is illegal?

3,"I figured that you were going to mention the wives, or maybe the women that trained the Handmaids. Even perhaps the stifling in the sense of Handmaids towards other Handmaids in certain situations (yet this protective). Take Serena Joy for example. Serena joy is an intelligent woman with a strong voice. She was an advocate for traditional values, as many women are today. She advocated for a system that turned out quite differently than she imagined, because now she too is oppressed and greatly unhappy. This is likely the case for most or all of the wives. It would be devastating to have to witness countless instances of her husband having sex with women whom she does not know, and would give rise to great jealousy or resentment towards the Handmaids. However, Serena becomes more gentle towards Offred. You could view Serena as pimping out Offred to Nick...or trying to protect Offred from the camps. We know that the latter was the case. You could say that Nick had a hand in her oppression when he had sex with her for Serena, yet in reality Nick is also oppressed in this act, and he later orchestrated Offred's escape. There is also an argument for the Commander's oppression, as he is portrayed as deeply unhappy with the current system as well. Like Serena, it turned out as more than he bargained for. I don't see the wives or really any of the main characters as misogynistic. That would be too simple...a surface explanation. Rather, everyone is oppressed and just trying to survive, and sometimes act out with the only ""power"" that they have left. 

You only have a short timeframe to drop the newborn off, and the newborn must show no signs of abuse or neglect at the time of the drop. Otherwise, there are legal and civil consequences. If you miss the timeframe, you cannot drop off the baby without legal and civil consequences. You may be able to drop off the newborn, but it does have rights legally and civilly beginning the moment it was born. Prolife argues that the unborn should have the same rights that the newborn does. ",1,1495984212,2017-05-28 11:10:12
4,"&gt;Well, since it's your fault they are on ur property, you do not get to choose to kill them. And in this hypothetical scenario, they are not threatening your life, so you aren't protecting yourself. Same with pregnancy in most cases.

So they aren’t violating my body somehow?  Or they are?  For this to be analogous to pregnancy, they need to be threatening to harm me severely enough that I will be hospitalized for a couple of days and take 6 weeks or more to recover enough to even go back to work.

Your source is saying that during pregnancy, woman may experience incontinence because of pressure from their uterus since it’s full of fetus.  This would not be a permanent change though- once the baby is gone, the pressure would be gone.  It goes on to say 

“After pregnancy, incontinence problems may continue, because childbirth weakens the pelvic floor muscles, which can cause an overactive bladder.”

So it persist because of childbirth.  Please answer this question: Do you dispute that pregnancy and childbirth are painful and some of the changes they cause are permanent?

&gt;Inducing early

I’m sorry to hear about your sister.  I think the doctors who do abortions would be just as fine with inducing early on an ethical level.  It’s not as safe to the mother, so they kill the fetus first since it’s going to end up dead anyway.  I don’t see how you can argue that it’s any different on a practical or ethical level.  In fact, they give a drug that blocks progesterone receptors during abortions, which is, in effect, inducing labor early.

&gt;The child has additional positive rights (right to have their ordinary needs met) that others do not have. 

Is it an ordinary need to live inside of someone else’s body?  What needs do children have that can’t be met by a non-parent adult?

&gt;I'm arguing that simply not wanting to own up the consequences of your actions is not a sufficient reason for killing an unborn child.

And I’m arguing that the legal right to determine who accesses your body doesn’t depend on your reason.  No reason is needed.  For example, do I need to provide a reason why I don’t want to have sex?  Does it matter what the reason is?  No!  Legally I have a right to choose, regardless of the circumstances.

&gt;No one that I know of has every shoved a baby up someone else's vagina, though what I think you're getting at rips rape. 

No, what I’m getting at is the threat of a baby going through your vagina (in or out) is a threat to your wellbeing.  The fetus might not be able to intend to threaten you, but it is a threat none the less.

&gt;The second trimester starts around the tenth week of pregnancy, and many sources that I've looked at on the subject of miscarriage/abortion say that late term abortion/miscarriage can be defined as early as twelve weeks

http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/pregnancy-your-first-trimester  The first trimester goes through the end of the 12th week.  This is the point when the risk for miscarriages drops significantly, and miscarriages after that are late.  However late term abortion is an unrelated term, referring to abortions after 20 weeks.


&gt;If you have sex knowing very well that it could result in pregnancy, you are responsible for the result and should not kill your child because you didn't want to be pregnant. 

This is your opinion, but the law doesn’t agree with you.  We don’t punish people who take risks by making them live with the outcome regardless of our ability to help them.

&gt;That being said, all the value in the world wouldn't give my child the right to live in my house without consent. (And let's assume, for the sake of this scenario, that there is no other place the child can go.)

Your child doesn’t have that right.  You can send him/her to boarding school or to live with other family members.  Your assumption is what makes the difference- a child has other places to go, a fetus does not.  That’s the crux of the issue!


&gt;How can you ignore the bodily autonomy of the child that didn't even choose to be conceived and is now being killed because his or her mother did not want him or her? 

I'm not ignoring it.  Its bodily autonomy is only being violated in self defense to the initial violation by said fetus.

&gt;In many ultrasounds of abortion, you can see and hear the child moving and trying to escape the abortion instruments.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silent_Scream#Medical_community  I can tell you my newborn wouldn’t have been physically capable of trying to avoid anything, lol.  A fetus wouldn’t be able to- they don’t have the neurological development.

&gt;However, if being afraid of being a bad parent justifies abortion inside the womb, shouldn't actually being a bad parent justify it outside the womb as well?

&gt;having a period doesn't even kill an organism. On the other hand, had you hired an abortionist to kill your daughter, your daughter would have been killed, rather than never existing in the first place.
Agreed, it’s not identical. However, her potential was only barely more realized than an egg.  Every time I ovulate without having a baby, I miss out on knowing whoever that egg would have become.  If I had aborted, I would have missed out on knowing who she’d become, but I would miss her as much as I miss my periods because she would have been just potential.

&gt;you could talk to them about it at the very least. 

You talk about it with them, for whatever reason mental health care is inaccessible.  You aren’t at fault if you child commits suicide.

&gt;Just because someone lets their kids die doesn't mean they have an unalienable right to let their kids die. And do you mind citing these cases?

True, and there are cases of the courts intervening and overriding parents’ decisions.  But generally speaking parents make decisions for kids, even life or death medical decisions.  [Here’s](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/should-children-be-forced-to-undergo-cancer-treatment#3) a link about chemo and one about [premies]( http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-evidence-complicates-decisions-on-when-to-save-extremely-premature-babies/).  

&gt;Just because they were/are mentally ill doesn't mean murder is suddenly legal. It means that they would not be held responsible for what they did because they were unable to make sound decisions.

This is from your article “The vast majority of parents who kill their children go to prison rather than mental institutions.”  So most people who kill their kids aren’t mentally ill, at least not to a court of law.

5,"Most of the woman who get abortions are on birth control.  They're trying their darnedest to keep that stranger out, not dragging it in.  The fetus may not have come in on its own volition, but it wasn't forced in either, most of the time.  

For the sake of argument, though, let's say I did force this stranger into my house and drug them.  They are unconscious, but violating my bodily autonomy.  What options to I have to defend myself from this violation?  Could I call a friend to help remove them?  Call the police to come defend me from the violation?  Roll them out the door without killing them?

&gt;Prochoice uses the argument that unwanted pregnancy is coerced organ donation. 

Forced pregnancy is a violation of bodily autonomy and forced organ donation is a violation of bodily autonomy.  Thus forced organ donation can be a good thought experiment for pregnancy, but I don't think anyone claims that pregnancy is literally the exact same as organ donation.

As far as value- I can't speak for the whole pro-choice movement.  Value is not a factor in my beliefs.  It's an issue of whether the fetus has a special right to access another person's body without her consent.  I don't think there's any reason to give it that special right.  Your grandma has a right to be cared for.  It's not violating anyone's rights by making sure she has her teeth brushed!

6,"&gt;You cannot remove pregnancy entirely from sex, it is impossible

Actually, according to the math I did, a slim majority of couples are infertile, either from age or medical reasons.  Once you're post-menopausal or doing IVF, I'd say pregnancy is pretty effectively removed from sex!

I think it's like eating.  Sure, most people get their nutrients by eating.  But most eating is not solely for nutrients.  We care that it tastes good, we eat for social and community reasons, we make birthday cakes, we have holiday traditions.  Our ancestors may have eaten just for the nutrients they needed to survive, but we don't.

I know the research is happening, but it is not driven by or funded by the pro-life movement.  Rather it's the infertility crowd.  It seems extremely inconsistent to me.  If I tried to make sugar illegal in the name of preventing diabetes but didn't donate any time or money to diabetes research, wouldn't you think my efforts were insincere and driven by an ulterior motive?

8,"&gt;I plan to tell her that pregnancy was hard, that there were times I had doubts and second guessed myself. That childbirth was extremely painful (want to hear my childbirth story?). That parenting is hard and painful at times. That I love her more than anyone else in my whole life, but that I chose to have her. 

Okay, I agree with most of this.  Pregnancy is definitely hard and childbirth is certainly a physical task to go through. But in almost every case of abortion, a woman *chose* to have sex that she knew would result in pregnancy. She chose to act in a way that would conceive that child. How can you ignore the bodily autonomy of the child that didn't even choose to be conceived and is now being killed because his or her mother did not want him or her? In many ultrasounds of abortion, you can see and hear the child moving and trying to [escape the abortion instruments.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gON-8PP6zgQ)

&gt;That no one, including her own children, has a right to use her body in ways she doesn’t want. 

That sounded kind of dirty, lol. But if she chooses to act in a way that will result in her having kids, they are not actively / choosing / intentionally  ""violating"" her body. 

&gt;In fact that lesson is one we’re starting now, no forced affection if she says no. 

I agree.

&gt;Society teaches young girls the opposite, sadly.

lmao what? Kids in college are being taught that if someone touches them even slightly(such as a tap on the shoulder), whether it was an accident or not, it is sexual assault. 

&gt;I probably won’t tell her this, at least not until she’s an adult, but I’ll share with you: I did spend some of my pregnancy terrified that I wasn’t actually ready, that I should get an abortion because I had made a huge mistake committing to this child. 

Thank you for sharing this with me. I appreciate your honesty.

However, if being afraid of being a bad parent justifies abortion inside the womb, shouldn't actually being a bad parent justify it outside the womb as well?

&gt;When I passed the 24 week mark and knew abortion would be so much harder to get, I had quite a bit of anxiety, especially until we got the ultrasound results back and knew she was healthy as far as we could tell. I had a plan of where I’d go to get an abortion if I needed one, because I knew it would be an expensive, time consuming prospect and I was scared. Pregnancy made me more staunchly pro-choice. Many times over, it reaffirmed that no one should be FORCED to undergo the process.

But you weren't forced to have sex and go through pregnancy. You chose to own up your actions and accept the consequences. That, IMO, is true responsibility, not abortion.

&gt;And every month that I have a period instead of getting pregnant, the same could be said about that egg. If I had aborted I would have lost out on the potential of who she is now, but I would have never known her to miss her.

I think you're confusing being alive with being an organism. Eggs are life, but they a) are not human life, and b) cannot reproduce and create more eggs. It needs to have been penetrated by sperm to be a human life. So having a period doesn't even kill an organism. On the other hand, had you hired an abortionist to kill your daughter, your daughter would have been killed, rather than never existing in the first place.

&gt;Sure. But let’s say you can’t afford to get them mental healthcare. Is it neglect if they go on to commit suicide? It’s not like you just ignored their needs- you were helpless to meet them.

You couldn't afford healthcare so you never addressed the topic? I think you could talk to them about it at the very least. And it sounds like the parent would qualify for Medicaid's mental health benefits: https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/health-insurance/

&gt;Let me give you my examples again of when it is within a parent’s rights to take actions that lead to the death of their child: When babies are born super premature, who decides whether to let them die or try to keep them alive (and likely disabled)? Who decides when a kid with cancer has had enough and stops getting chemo?

Just because someone lets their kids die doesn't mean they have an unalienable right to let their kids die. And do you mind citing these cases?

&gt;You have to acknowledge that the law doesn’t agree with you, right? Or else no one who killed their child would ever go to jail for it, we wouldn’t have trials, there would be no laws against it… it would just be a mental illness.

Just because they were/are mentally ill doesn't mean murder is suddenly legal. It means that they would not be held responsible for what they did because they were unable to make sound decisions. 

http://healthland.time.com/2011/02/01/psychiatrist-phillip-resnick-on-why-parents-kill-their-own-kids/ Though their remaining children would probably be taken away from them .

I don't think the law / argument from authority is a good argument, because over history, many rights have been violated. Take the Islamic countries for example, where women are treated like property.

&gt;My glib response: because you’re pro-life. Less glibly, some of what you were saying was “out there” even for a pro-lifer, so I felt the need to clarify.

So because I'm a prolifer, I must want to control women? That's confusing, 'cos I'm female myself. I wouldn't want to take any rights from myself. ",1,1495912746,2017-05-27 15:19:06
9,"&gt;Ok, so **I lured a person to my house and drugged them.**

See? You brought them into your property. They wouldn't be there if it weren't for your actions.

&gt;Somehow this person is violating my bodily autonomy, despite being drugged. What options would I have in that scenario to protect myself?

Well, since it's your fault they are on your property, you do not get to choose to kill them. And in this hypothetical scenario, they are not threatening your life, so you aren't protecting yourself. Same with pregnancy in most cases.

1/ [source](http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/america-asks-11/pregnancy) - ""Incontinence can continue after pregnancy and may not be present right after childbirth... In pregnancy, the expanding uterus puts pressure on the bladder. The muscles in the bladder sphincter and in the pelvic floor can be overwhelmed by the extra stress or pressure on the bladder.""

2/ Also, I didn't say pregnancy has nothing to do with the health of the mother. I said less than 3% of abortion are performed because of a health concern, and abortion doesn't solve the urinary incontinence problem because the woman has already been pregnant.

3/ It should be considered a great feat to bring about one of the greatest miracles of life. Our society should celebrate women on carrying a pregnancy, not abortion. We are warriors. Perhaps she can use the funds to address any issues? I know she can get money for medical and living expenses.

Also /u/socialworker80 said, 

&gt;No, I am saying that pregnancy is not organ donation by any sense of the word. Prochoice uses the argument that unwanted pregnancy is coerced organ donation. Then they use the ""kicker"" that no one uses coerced organ donation, so there should be no coerced pregnancy, because ""duh"". But since coerced organ donation does exist, and pregnancy is not organ donation, that particular argument is null and void.

&gt;I want to make sure I understand. You are not ok with a woman inducing early if it is likely that the fetus will be healthy. In other words, abortion without first killing the fetus would still be problematic for you? So your issue is not (just) with the killing of the fetus, but rather with the mother’s refusal to keep it alive with her uterus?

1/  A doctor isn't going to agree to do that 3 months early without a medical reason because of the high health and death risk to the baby being born that early. And labor can't be induced if the baby is breech.

2/ I think that you have to consider the relationship of the child to the parent. The child has additional positive rights (right to have their ordinary needs met) that others do not have. She caused her child to be concieved. She should not let it die simply because she no longer wants it or never wanted it in the first place.

3/ I don't think there are many doctors out there that would be willing to induce labor very early and kill the child via inducing early labour just for bodily autonomy reasons. I had a sister who died just because my mom went into labour too early(and no, it was not induced.)

&gt;So you are arguing that pregnancy is not a threat to the mother’s wellbeing? Keep in mind that all pregnancy ends in childbirth, which is itself an imminent threat of harm. 

I'm not arguing that pregnancy isn't painful or physically tasking. I'm arguing that simply not wanting to own up the consequences of your actions is not a sufficient reason for killing an unborn child.

&gt;If someone threatened to push a baby back up your vagina, wouldn’t you feel entitled to defend yourself? Why shouldn’t women be entitled to defend themselves from pushing a baby out? Plus, pushing the baby out is the best case scenario. There is a huge chance that a woman will need a c-section, so really she’s being threatened with major abdominal wounds.

No one that I know of has every shoved a baby up someone else's vagina, though what I think you're getting at hints at rape. If someone is raping you or raped you, they deserve to be punished, not the child. It's not like the child had a choice or say in how or whether it was concieved.

&gt;Could just as easily be said “I had sex responsibly and my birth control failed. I am low income, but social programs aren’t sufficient to pay for all the expenses of a child. If I continue this pregnancy, I will lose my job, my housing, my chance at college/a career even if I don’t keep the baby. It sucks, but the most compassionate option for this child and for me is to end the pregnancy now before it has the capacity to suffer.”

Yes, kill the child because there's a possibility that it might live a tough life. The woman should make plans for adoption immediately upon learning that she is pregnant. It sounds to me like she has Medicaid benefits. She could easily get on pregnancy Medicaid in her situation to cover the costs if she has neither. While she stays at home the adoption process will pay her living expenses as negotiated. Then she has the baby adopted and returns to work. She could have an open adoption to keep in contact with the child 

&gt;And here’s an alternative reality for you: “I had irresponsible sex and can’t deal with the fact that I’m not ready to be a parent. Instead I’ll have the baby and abuse and neglect it.” You tell me which is more responsible!

Adoption. No one should be ashamed of not being ready to be a parent. But that doesn't mean the child has to die.

&gt;You’re leaving out the other reason, which is that abortion is hard to access in some places, some women can’t afford it, so they have to get a later abortion because of financial reasons. 

I still doubt a people would see those as good reasons to kill your child. 

&gt;Also I think 20 weeks is the most commonly accepted threshold for “late term”, which drops the percentage down to 1.3% of abortions.

The second trimester starts around the tenth week of pregnancy, and many sources that I've looked at on the subject of miscarriage/abortion say that late term abortion/miscarriage can be defined as early as twelve weeks(around the time abortion percentages drop)[This one](http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/16/late-miscarriage/) says that ""Late miscarriages are defined as those that occur between 14 and 20 weeks.""

[The majority of pro-lifers and pro-choicers](http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx) favor making abortion illegal in the 2nd(after ten weeks)and 3rd trimester.

&gt;We don’t. We let women choose who they have sex with and what contraception they use. Consent is hugely important for both sexual and reproductive autonomy.

I agree with you. Consent is important. However, foreknowledge also matters in this situation. If you have sex knowing very well that it could result in pregnancy, you are responsible for the result and should not kill your child because you didn't want to be pregnant. Pregnancies only happen one way. The Stork does not bring them. And when it comes down to it, you shouldn't get to kill another human because you weren't responsible or careful in weighing out your risks.

&gt;Nope, and I think most pro-choice people would agree that fetuses aren't completely without value. That said, all the value in the world wouldn’t give any fetus the right to live in my body without my consent.

That being said, all the value in the world wouldn't give my child the right to live in my house without consent. (And let's assume, for the sake of this scenario, that there is no other place the child can go.)

Because not all women want to stay pregnant and give birth, it's as simple as that.  Pregnancy and childbirth can still be difficult and in some cases, life-threatening for a number of women, even in the 21st century.  

That is why only the woman who is pregnant gets to decide whether to continue a pregnancy or not.  And it doesn't have to be a serious medical reason for choosing abortion instead of adoption.  ""I don't want to be pregnant"" and ""I don't want a baby"" are two perfectly valid reasons for choosing abortion, and it is each woman's right to make that choice.",1,1495900936,2017-05-27 12:02:16
14,"What she means by the analogy is, the unborn baby is the innocent stranger that you dragged into your home uterus and then you killed it via abortion. She thinks that sex was the dragging in, because the unborn didn't come into your uterus through its own volition.

Then they use the ""kicker"" that no one uses coerced organ donation, so there should be no coerced pregnancy, because ""duh"". But since coerced organ donation does exist, and pregnancy is not organ donation, that particular argument is null and void. 

With this particular position, pregnant women who seek abortions would fall into the category of someone with full autonomy, putting themselves over and above as more important or valuable than an innocent with no autonomy. Thus is human nature, people tend to think of themselves as individuals who are more important than just about anyone else. My family gets pissed when the nursing staff treats my grandmother like that. You know, keep her in her wheelchair longer than she is medically allowed, don't brush her teeth, sometimes don't dress her properly, leave caked food on her hands, need to change her sheets...my grandmother is a person regardless of if she can speak up for herself or complain. You know that the nursing staff do not treat themselves like that!

The prochoice position is absolutely about value. It seems that you are just one of the variants that doesn't see it that way. Prochoice people have told me that the unborn are not as valuable as the already born hence why it is not immoral or shouldn't matter because it is the woman's right and the unborn has no rights, that they are not people, some claim that they are not human or that they are parasites, others say that their value is so low that they are akin to a pimple or a severed finger or a fleck of dandruff. Then there is that whole clump of cells argument. But you have a child, so you know full well that by the time that most abortions occur it is absolutely not a clump of cells. It's called embryology...they should read a book. Every example that I have given are comments that I have received on the topic.

15,"Sex exists for reproduction. Sure, if we evolve and are smart enough to twist and turn its meaning and usefulness into our culture, we will. But ultimately its primary function will have always been reproduction. If not, pregnancy could have just evolved out of the mix. But it hasn't, and we still have to use birth control if we don't want it ending in a pregnancy. You cannot remove pregnancy entirely from sex, it is impossible, as they are forever linked. 

I don't know that a March of Dimes is necessary for miscarriages because efforts have already went into medically trying to stop miscarriages. It is already focused on. But a March of Dimes would be nice. Research efforts and money are continually ongoing every year to stop miscarriages. A new study finding just made [Time Magazine ](http://amp.timeinc.net/time/4629589/miscarriage-progesterone-pregnancy/?source=dam) this year. Knowing how big this industry is just requires a simple Google search. There are organizations out there that are trying to get more money spent and get the medical guidelines updated to better diagnose conditions that lead to miscarriages. 

I think that the birth rate has many contributing factors. I think that abortion matters just like anything else, because it is a factor where people willingly end a life. I would say that most people don't realize that our birth rate is actually a crisis. We are not reproducing enough to replenish our workforce.

18,"&gt;No, you have to be dragging an innocent into your home for the soul purpose of killing them, to accept her analogy.

That is pretty hugely dissimilar from an accidental pregnancy...

&gt;It is that organ donation itself involves the permanent use of a vital or non vital organ, that is leaving your body indefinitely.

Without getting into the permanency of pregnancy changes, why does this matter?  Are you arguing that it's acceptable for someone to take my kidney without my consent if they plan to give it back in the future?

&gt;Many of us currently have limited or no bodily autonomy. Limited: prisoners, children. No: my grandmother with Alzheimer's, people in comas. 

So the people you list are either incapable of taking care of themselves or being punished.  Which group do pregnant women fall into?

&gt;We do not think that us with full autonomy are more valuable than those of us that do not have that luxury.

The pro-choice argument is not about value, though.  You can value the fetus as much as your grandmother.  Does your grandmother live inside of you?  Is she threatening to burst through your vagina?

&gt;So prochoice says that in a dystopian society that abortion would be illegal and that would be terrifying. But in a dystopian or eugenics society, they would kill my grandmother. How is one more important than the other?

&gt; pregnancy is the main cause of urinary incontinence, so abortion won't fix that. 

I’d really love a source here.  Urinary incontinence is caused by issues with pelvic floor muscles.  Issues that don’t happen until the end of pregnancy or as a result of childbirth.  That’s what my doctor told me, anyway, so feel free to find something that contradicts.  In any event, that’s just one example.  Do you dispute that pregnancy and childbirth are painful and some of the changes they cause are permanent?  

&gt;If you look at the US Code laws regarding murder, it is easily argued that abortion is murder. 

I’m not asking about abortion.  I’m asking you what the law says about organ donation/allowing them to die when I have caused someone else to need the organ.

&gt; Murder induction vs murder dismemberment.

I want to make sure I understand.  You are not ok with a woman inducing early if it is likely that the fetus will be healthy.  In other words, abortion without first killing the fetus would still be problematic for you?  So your issue is not (just) with the killing of the fetus, but rather with the mother’s refusal to keep it alive with her uterus?

&gt; it can die peacefully

This stood out to me.  A lot of babies aborted for medical reasons are aborted because they will be in pain from the moment they are born until they die.  FYI.



&gt;Looking at reasons for abortion, I would say it is desperation. But I think we focus so much on her just not wanting to be pregnant that you ignore the adoption option because you insist that it's only about carrying another human being. 

A few things here.  1. Adoption is not an alternative to pregnancy.  Pregnancy, even aside from parenting, can come with all kinds of expenses (financial, social, etc).  2.) Did you see the other posters talking about how 1/3rd ish of women who get abortions believe adoption to be unethical?  3.  My focus is on the legal arguments.  Bodily autonomy is an argument about legal rights.  What society should be allowed to force of individuals.  The reasons for a person’s choice don’t impact the legality of forced pregnancy.

&gt; Health reasons don't even make up a big percentage of reasons given for abortion, and that's including minor threats to the mother's health.

So you are arguing that pregnancy is not a threat to the mother’s wellbeing?  Keep in mind that all pregnancy ends in childbirth, which is itself an imminent threat of harm.  If someone threatened to push a baby back up your vagina, wouldn’t you feel entitled to defend yourself?  Why shouldn’t women be entitled to defend themselves from pushing a baby out?

Could just as easily be said “I had sex responsibly and my birth control failed.  I am low income, but social programs aren’t sufficient to pay for all the expenses of a child.

&gt;According to Guttmacher, about 1,000,000 abortions are done every year, and 4.8% of those are done at 16+ weeks gestation ( = 48,000 abortions). Even if a full half of those are for medical reasons (very unlikely), that means 24,000 late-term abortions done annually for non-medical reasons. So, 49,000 (or 24,000) babies killed every single day because a mother ""didn't recognize she was pregnant or misjudged gestation"". 

You’re leaving out the other reason, which is that abortion is hard to access in some places, some women can’t afford it, so they have to get a later abortion because of financial reasons.  Also I think 20 weeks is the most commonly accepted threshold for “late term”, which drops the percentage down to 1.3% of abortions

&gt;If you have birthed a child and choose not to put him into adoption, you must care for him or her. If not, you will have criminal charges put against you. 

False.  The father, or really any adult I designate, can be responsible for caring for the child.  So, unless you have another example, I think we’re in agreement that there are no other times that my bodily autonomy is co-opted to keep another human alive?

&gt;Previously you compared your self defense of abortion to a military officer defending the country, etc, but you later changed it.

No, I’m sure you’re getting mixed up.

&gt;In 99% of the cases of abortion, women have the bodily autonomy to consent to having sex and using contraception. How come we ignore that fact until they are pregnant?

We don’t.  We let women choose who they have sex with and what contraception they use.  Consent is hugely important for both sexual and reproductive autonomy.

&gt;So your daughter was only valuable because you wanted her? 

Nope, and I think most pro-choice people would agree that fetuses aren't completely without value.  That said, all the value in the world wouldn’t give any fetus the right to live in my body without my consent.


&gt;Geez, is this how you talk to your daughter about it?

I plan to tell her that pregnancy was hard, that there were times I had doubts and second guessed myself.  That childbirth was extremely painful (want to hear my childbirth story?).  That parenting is hard and painful at times.  That I love her more than anyone else in my whole life, but that I chose to have her.  That no one, including her own children, has a right to use her body in ways she doesn’t want.  In fact that lesson is one we’re starting now, no forced affection if she says no.  Society teaches young girls the opposite, sadly.  

I probably won’t tell her this, at least not until she’s an adult, but I’ll share with you: I did spend some of my pregnancy terrified that I wasn’t actually ready, that I should get an abortion because I had made a huge mistake committing to this child.  When I passed the 24 week mark and knew abortion would be so much harder to get, I had quite a bit of anxiety, especially until we got the ultrasound results back and knew she was healthy as far as we could tell.  I had a plan of where I’d go to get an abortion if I needed one, because I knew it would be an expensive, time consuming prospect and I was scared.  Pregnancy made me more staunchly pro-choice.  Many times over, it reaffirmed that no one should be FORCED to undergo the process.

&gt;Had you aborted your daughter, she would not be here. The person she is now, the person you have brought into this world, would not be here. 

And every month that I have a period instead of getting pregnant, the same could be said about that egg.  If I had aborted I would have lost out on the potential of who she is now, but I would have never known her to miss her.

&gt;But that isn't the child's fault or choice. It is her partner violating her. The child has no say or control in whether it is concieved.

Right so in reproductive coercion it is the domestic partner who’s violating the woman.  My point is that forced pregnancy is a form of violence.  If abortion were illegal, it would be the state that was being coercive, abusive, and violent.

&gt;If you are ignoring your child's suicidal thoughts or problems, knowing that they may harm themselves, you are by definition neglecting your child.

Sure.  But let’s say you can’t afford to get them mental healthcare.  Is it neglect if they go on to commit suicide?  It’s not like you just ignored their needs- you were helpless to meet them.  

Let me give you my examples again of when it is within a parent’s rights to take actions that lead to the death of their child: When babies are born super premature, who decides whether to let them die or try to keep them alive (and likely disabled)? Who decides when a kid with cancer has had enough and stops getting chemo? 

&gt; IMO, if you have a desire to kill your child- your own child, that you have a certain connection with that no other human being can replicate exactly, due to stress or not realizing you were pregnant - killing an innocent child, you are mentally ill to an extent.

You have to acknowledge that the law doesn’t agree with you, right?  Or else no one who killed their child would ever go to jail for it, we wouldn’t have trials, there would be no laws against it… it would just be a mental illness.

They must? This is news to me. Who is forcing these people to undergo treatment?
&gt;I'm still not sure why you think I have some crazed desire to control all women.

Wanting a child doesn't make birth less painful.  Pain is a result of things like physical trauma to the perineum, degrees of tearing, surgical birth incisions, postpartum constipation, and other things.

Wow.  That's a very irrelevant, speculative, and hurtful direction to take the conversation in.   If anything, the children of women who are free to choose have extra assurance that they were wanted since their mothers would have had no reservations about aborting.

24,"&gt;I think you must be confusing me with someone else. This would also explain why you keep talking about parasites.

It's not an exact quote. But this is how you are behaving. Previously in our conversation, you said this: 

&gt;If a person is violating me, even unintentionally, I am under no obligation to accept it. If someone were sleep-molesting me, would I have to just tolerate it? No. I get to decide who uses my body, when they do it, and how they’re allowed to. Intention doesn’t matter. With abortion, there is no way to end the violation without killing. That is the minimal amount of force necessary for me to assert my right to my body.

Yes, no abortion =rape and no ability to defend yourself. I think you should talk to /u/socialworker80 about using rape and self defense situations to defend abortion. Previously you compared your self defense of abortion to a military officer defending the country, etc, but you later changed it. 

Continuing onward:

&gt;I think the self-defense argument addresses this. If someone is violating me, I get to “make decisions” for their body to defend myself.

And

&gt;None of that matters. It's in her body and it's unwanted. It does not have permission to be there. Let's say I am consensually having sex with someone, they did not force themselves on me, they did not invade me, they are inside my body with my permission. But oh! I no longer want to have sex! I don't want them in my body anymore! I revoke my consent, and they must leave. Their presence is no longer wanted. If they refuse and stay inside of me, that is rape. It is a violation of my body without my consent. In the same way that a fetus who doesn't leave when I tell it to is violating my body. No force necessary for the violation to occur.

&gt;They consent to it. Consent is key here. 

In 99% of the cases of abortion, women have the bodily autonomy to consent to having sex and using contraception. How come we ignore that fact until they are pregnant?

&gt;I consented to giving birth to my daughter and enduring the pain of childbirth and recovery. If I hadn’t consented and was compelled by the state to go through that, it would have been torture. Literally.

So your daughter was only valuable because you wanted her? Kind of sad that you think a person's only worth is whether they are valued by others. That their very rights depend on it.

Geez, is this how you talk to your daughter about it?

""Hey, did you know I spent all of the pregnancy tolerating it for you? I could have aborted you at any time, but I decided I wanted you so I didn't and childbirth and the pregnancy wasn't painful.""

""You mean you could have spent your pregnancy toying with deciding to end my life or not?""

""Not end your life, honey. Had I not wanted you,  you would have been violating my bodily autonomy as a result of my actions and I would have been in full rights to kill you to defend myself.""

Had you aborted your daughter, she would not be here. The person she is now, the person you have brought into this world, would not be here. She would have been extinguished from the world completely. Every aspect of her would be gone. Even if you concieved again later, the baby you gave birth to would not be her.

&gt;Have you heard of the term reproductive coercion? It’s a form of violence against women and includes forcing someone to stay pregnant when she doesn’t want to be.

But that isn't the child's fault or choice. It is her partner violating her. The child has no say or control in whether it is concieved.

&gt;Why did you ignore all my examples where a parent does make a choice to let a child die and it’s not neglect? Also I’m super skeptical that parents of a teenager who tried to commit suicide would get charged with neglect. Do you have any examples of cases where that happened?

My analogy was just that- an analogy. I don't have an exact source. Although it fits the bill for child neglect and there are many cases of similar forms. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_neglect

https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect.htm

&gt;- Physical neglect refers to the **failure to provide a child with basic necessities of life such as food and clothing.**

&gt;- Medical neglect is when **caregivers do not meet children's basic health care needs.** 

&gt;- Emotional neglect is **failing to provide emotional support such as emotional security and encouragement.**

If you are ignoring your child's suicidal thoughts or problems, knowing that they may harm themselves, you are by definition neglecting your child. 

https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/redefining-fatal-child-neglect

&gt;There are a million factors that can affect someone’s mood, thinking, and behaviors. Mental illness is a mental health condition that does so.

&gt;So acting under stress = mental illness = not allowed to make your own medical decisions? That seems like a really broad definition that would include all humans at one point in time or another.

Mere stress doesn't create mental illness, but I'd think that if you kill someone under stress than yeah you are mentally ill.

&gt;No, we don’t. That’s why mental illness is a defense at a murder trial. If being a murderer automatically meant you were mentally ill, no one would ever stand trial.

Come on.

&gt;They are the ones currently administering abortions for the sake of the woman’s health… They are already able to veto it if someone is truly mentally ill and unable to give consent to an abortion.

Currently abortion is legal. I'm sure that if it were illegal except in life of the mother cases, they would have able to find just as effective solutions without killing the child.

1/ your comparison here is not even remotely comparable so I won't waste my time with it. In the scenario I was speaking of,  you are responsible for *dragging the person into your home* and *drugging them so as to make it impossible for them to leave for a period of time.* Because this is the case as with pregnancy: you are responsible for bringing this person into your uterus.

2/ pregnancy is the main cause of urinary incontinence, so abortion won't fix that. And I doubt people would support your right to kill a baby because you suffered from side effects caused by the actions you took to put the child where it would affect your health.

&gt;You think it's immoral. What does the legal precedent say? Remember that pro-choice is fundamentally a legal stance.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent

If you look at the US Code laws regarding murder, it is easily argued that abortion is murder. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111

&gt;Not in abortion. By removing a fetus from my uterus I am letting it die as much as I am killing it. It couldn’t live outside of me. If abortion were to happen by inducing labor and forcing the fetus to be born prematurely, would you find that acceptable?

I'm hoping you are just playing stupid. In abortion, the child is not merely disconnected from the mother; it is actively killing the child by dismemberment, poison, etc. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5THDmys8z30 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jgw4X7Dw_3k https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Af8vIym2o

To answer your other question: Murder induction vs murder dismemberment.

If a woman can induce early, but not so early that they likely die or will be disabled if they barely survive...okay fine. 

If they abort because the baby is incompatible with life, bullshit. They can carry to term and arrange hospice ahead of time. They cannot accurately predict how fast death comes. They could spend hours or days with their baby and it can die peacefully instead of being ruthlessly murdered.

If the mother is going to die, induction. Some women make the hard choice to carry their baby anyway, but that is not for everyone. 

Looking at reasons for abortion, I would say it is desperation. But I think we focus so much on her just not wanting to be pregnant that you ignore the adoption option because you insist that it's only about carrying another human being. again- though I think it's mostly out of desperation, women who #shoutyourabortion on twitter and such have in their minds that not only do they not have to care for this child, but this person who they created will not exist in this world period, ever. Because it ""violated"" your bodily autonomy. 

&gt;I’m not sure why you say that. If someone threatens to rape me, for example. Or cut off my fingers. I don’t have to allow them to do that just because their actions won’t put me on the cusp of my death. I can protect myself from violations and harm to my body, like what happens in forced pregnancy and childbirth.

Yeah, the fetus is totally threatening to rape you, cut of your fingers, and inflict other bodily harm on you. OK then. Health reasons don't even make up a big percentage of reasons given for abortion, and that's including **minor threats** to the mother's health. So your comparisons are not on equal footing.

&gt;This is your opinion. It is not fact. Fact cannot exist when the question is: what is the most responsible decision in a given scenario. There are always going to be different opinions. These opinions are not a basis for making laws to control the behavior of all American women. You believe that a pregnant woman should not get an abortion as a way of taking responsibility for having had sex. I believe that a pregnant woman who doesn’t want to be pregnant is taking responsibility by getting an abortion. We have differing opinions. That’s ok! But yours is not legally any more weighty than mine or anyone elses.


Mhmm. ""I had irresponsible sex and can't deal with the consequences even though if I am low income I definitely qualify for medicaid(and benefits for pregnancy due to that), so I'm going to kill my child and face responsibility!!""

&gt;This is the first result of the google search “why do women get late term abortions” http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/06/truth-late-term-abortions/. There’s a lot of articles about it. I think we can agree that they’re rare and largely irrelevant to overall discussion of abortion.

As for them being rare, I think you're being very liberal with the term ""rare"". 

[According to Guttmacher, about 1,000,000 abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states)  are done every year, and [4.8%](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/styles/scale_900x720/public/images/whenwomenhaveabortionsgraph.png?itok=FZwOFb8B) of those are done at 16+ weeks gestation ( = 48,000 abortions). Even if a full half of those are for medical reasons (very unlikely), that means 24,000 late-term abortions done annually for non-medical reasons. So, 49,000 (or 24,000) babies killed every single day  because a mother ""didn't recognize she was pregnant or misjudged gestation"". Sorry but I don't see how anyone would be ok with that many babies killed, every day, for those reasons.

&gt;On what basis do you say that? In what other circumstances do we take away the bodily autonomy of someone who created a need in someone else?

If you have birthed a child and choose not to put him into adoption, you must care for him or her. If not, you will have criminal charges put against you. In other cases that you didn't cause but are still affecting your body against your will, there are plenty of those.",1,1495821607,2017-05-26 14:00:07
27,"&gt; “Some pro-life people are against the killing of unborn babies, but they won’t speak out in support of the girl who chooses to keep her baby,” she said. “Honestly, that makes me feel like maybe the abortion would have been better. Then they would have just forgiven me, rather than deal with this visible consequence.”

Where pro-life just becomes anti-sex. No doesn't matter that you kept the baby, you screwed up by getting pregnant in the first place and then you're punished further for keeping the baby. That doesn't make any sense! If you want people to feel free to choose life, support them!

28,"No, you have to be dragging an innocent into your home for the soul purpose of killing them, to accept her analogy. 

It's not if the organ is vital to life or not per se regarding the comparison to organ donation. It is that organ donation itself involves the permanent use of a vital or non vital organ, that is leaving your body indefinitely. When you donate your shirt to Goodwill, you don't get it back because it has been donated. 

The problem with that type of organ donation practice comes about because you cannot harvest the organs of a dead person. So these people are ""alive"" by some measure. It becomes very meaningful with people that are deemed brain dead. The medical community thinks that they have the brain death thing figured out. They take the person in and begin harvesting organs while blood is flowing. If you do some research, there have been people who have woken up from said brain death, stating that they overheard discussion regarding turning off life support, and were unable to move or speak to protest. How many would wake up if we indefinitely stop pulling their plugs?

The other issue lies with said bodily autonomy. Many of us currently have limited or no bodily autonomy. Limited: prisoners, children. No: my grandmother with Alzheimer's, people in comas. Suspects in crimes are forced to submit to swabs and blood draws. My grandmother is forced to do all sorts of things because she can't even consent to a bath. That lack of bodily autonomy really shows when the nursing home staff forgets to brush her teeth for two days. The unborn have no bodily autonomy. We as a society protect those of us who are weaker having limited or no bodily autonomy. We do not think that us with full autonomy are more valuable than those of us that do not have that luxury. Yet we no longer protect the unborn. 

So prochoice says that in a dystopian society that abortion would be illegal and that would be terrifying. But in a dystopian or eugenics society, they would kill my grandmother. How is one more important than the other?",2,1495809720,2017-05-26 10:42:00

Anyway, women absolutely can by misogynist against other women.  Look no farther than ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" for fictional examples.  For real life examples, I think the Duggar ladies fit the bill.

&gt;we all understand that we as a society judge harshly those pregnant women who do not make the ""right"" choices

I believe that a black person can be racist against a white person, but a white person cannot be a victim of institutional racism. 

I am of the mind that if we are going to say that no black person ever can be a reverse racist, as some in our current political and social climate claim-then we cannot say that a Muslim Saudi woman, who has escaped Islam and is now by definition an apostate and thus marked for death by ISIS, can be a misogynist. 

Haha. I understand. She is actually not okay with forced organ donation, I think she may have responded to that impression by now. 

We do not obviously control the diet, vitamin use, travel, or even natal care of pregnant women. Yet there are medical recommendations, and sometimes consequences to not following those recommendations. But we all understand that we as a society judge harshly those pregnant women who do not make the ""right"" choices, and hence there is significant societal pressure.

We freak out because that Duggar girl was traveling abroad again while pregnant. We were disgusted that Octomom had so many babies implanted. We were probably more disgusted that Michelle Duggar wouldn't stop having babies-we blamed her when her daughter was premature-we blamed her more when her other daughter was stillborn. 

If we all have these equal rights to bodily autonomy and we can always trust women to make choices, it does not seem like we always act like it's true though. ",2,1495770987,2017-05-25 23:56:27

&gt;use of the uterus is akin to organ donation. The uterus is not required for the woman to live

First of all, is it only a violation of my bodily autonomy if the violation occurs in a vital organ?  Secondly, in any organ donation with a live donor, the organ being donated is not vital.  Third, the fetus effects every organ in her body.  The hormones flood out and really any body system you want to talk about is altered by pregnancy, including the vital ones.

&gt;and the uterus does not leave her body

Do you think that an organ leaving your body is a necessary component of a violation of bodily autonomy?

&gt;and its use is not permanent.

I mentioned earlier how the effects of pregnancy/childbirth are often permanent.  Also I want to know if you think that a permanent effect is necessary for something to be a violation of my bodily autonomy.

Forced organ donation is used as an example of a violation of bodily autonomy.  Obviously it is different than pregnancy in the ways you mention, but none of these features mitigate the comparison of one violation to another.  

The legal precedent is that I get to choose who has access to what parts of my body, right?  They can't take a cheek swab without my consent.  I can't be forced to donate blood.  There are no long term effects of either of these procedures.  These cells aren't required for me to live.  Why should them leaving my body impact the legal precedent that no ones gets to use parts of me without my consent?  

Your examples are with dead people, right?  So your argument is that because in some places (not the US) there is the presumption that dead people consent to donating their organs, we should (in the US) ignore the explicit statement that the pregnant woman is NOT consenting to her fetus's use of her body?

&gt; Again, while a child requires nine months out of your entire life, organ donation requires the use of an organ, to be taken away from you.

Many of the physical effects of pregnancy last forever.  Take, for example, incontinence.  As many as half of all moms have urine leaks still 5 years after giving birth [source]( https://www.fitpregnancy.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/leaky-business).  If the amount of time spent in an altered state is the defining difference between pregnancy and abortion, they are both life long changes to your body.

&gt;if you caused someone to be in an accident, it would be more comparable to pregnancy and abortion, but even though I think it is immoral to allow someone to die because of what you did that caused them to need a kidney! 

You think it's immoral.  What does the legal precedent say?  Remember that pro-choice is fundamentally a legal stance.

&gt;I think there is a vast difference between killing someone and just letting them die.

Not in abortion.  By removing a fetus from my uterus I am letting it die as much as I am killing it.  It couldn’t live outside of me.  If abortion were to happen by inducing labor and forcing the fetus to be born prematurely, would you find that acceptable?  
 
&gt; Calling it self-defense would only be justified when the mother's health is on the cusp of her death.

I’m not sure why you say that.  If someone threatens to rape me, for example.  Or cut off my fingers.  I don’t have to allow them to do that just because their actions won’t put me on the cusp of my death.  I can protect myself from violations and harm to my body, like what happens in forced pregnancy and childbirth.

&gt; Generally speaking, again, we don't consider bodily autonomy to override people's right to not be attacked.

Please give me any other example where I am forced to endure an assault on my body and not attack the person assaulting me.

&gt; in the context we are speaking of, being responsible and taking care of the result means not killing the child you created.

&gt;Mothers and fathers are legally obligated to care for and protect their children.

Ok, thanks for answering my questions.  Your previous answers had seemed to suggest you didn’t think pregnant women should get a say in their lives because pregnant.  I’m really glad that is not the case!",2,1495764048,2017-05-25 22:00:48
35,"&gt; I am floored that anyone could say that they are skeptical that sex is genuinely at its very root of existence for procreation. Every mammal procreates through sex.

Sure, but humans have this thing called culture.  Without culture, sex is just about reproduction.  With culture it can be for all kinds of things.  There are cultural anthropologists who devote their whole work to studying what sex means to different cultures.  Ultimately I don't think sex has one single root purpose.  I think every person who has sex has their own purposes for doing so.  Most of the time, for most humans, this is not baby making.  

&gt; We also try to prevent miscarriage and early labor when possible. 

Where is the march for dimes equivalent for miscarriages, then?  Where is the fund raising and money being devoted to saving those fertilized eggs from dying?  ""When possible"" is entirely defined by technology.  Where are the pro-life scientists frantically trying to advocate for alllllll the dead ""people"" and expand our technological abilities?  If there were a new virus that killed half the people it infect, we would see massive efforts to find a cure and/or vaccine.  Where is that effort for embryos?

&gt;Why would it only be up to prolife to fund fertility research?

Because it's by and large pro-life people who claim to see fertilized eggs as people, as far as I'm aware.

&gt; Do you think that the fact that we are at our lowest birth rate in history, is in any way-even loosely-tied to abortion? 

I think availability of abortion could correlate with birth rate, but there are many other factors that I would expect to correlate as well, probably more strongly.  Here's some options: http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/ncc/Notes/Chapter6.pop/chapter.6.what.factors.affect.birth.fertility.rates.outline.html

Ultimately what does it matter?

Sure, if I could only save one of two toddlers I would save my own.  But if it were my eggs vs. someone else's toddler, I'd save the toddler.  Even if they were my only eggs ever and the toddler is a stranger's.  Egg donors exist, my life could have been fine without kids in it... those fertilized eggs are potential, but the toddler is an actual person.

Let me give you some scenarios.  In all of these, you can only save one:
1.) The petri dish has 3 of your fertilized eggs in it.  You can save it or your toddler.

2.)  The petri dish has 3 of your eggs in it, but you have a dozen more in a freezer somewhere safe.  The toddler is yours.

3.) Same as 2 except the toddler is someone else's.

4.) A petri dish with 3 eggs or a stroller with 2 toddlers?  How about a stroller with 3 toddlers?  The toddlers can be yours or someone else's.",1,1495760566,2017-05-25 21:02:46
36,"/u/socialworker80 addressed most of your comments about organ donation, so I'll touch on it very briefly before moving on to the other topics.

1/ if you dragged an unconscious person into your property, you would be responsible for whatever position you would find yourself in as a result. Their position would not be their fault as they have no control(or possibly even knowledge) over where they have been relocated to. It would be your fault for beinging them in the house, and again, since your actions cause the child to be created in your body. 

2/ I didn't say I supported forced organ donation. You said there was no comparable situation supported by people and I gave you a source because it was a false claim. Again, while a child requires nine months out of your entire life, organ donation requires the use of an organ, to be taken away from you. I think if you caused someone to be in an accident, it would be more comparable to pregnancy and abortion, but even though I think it is immoral to allow someone to die because of what you did that caused them to need a kidney! I think there is a vast difference between killing someone and just letting them die. Abortion murders an innocent and defenseless person, who is per science alive and unique. There is no comparison between the two in the way that you are stating it.

[see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/5491av/do_you_support_the_government_forcing_you_to/d80i4ly/)

&gt;Well that’s not legally how self-defense works. I can fear bodily harm, not just death, and act to defend myself. Look at your definition. No one should be forced to endure child birth (imminent physical harm). If it’s forced, that’s unlawful. It meets all the requirements.


Ok so you're leaning on two definitions here: 

A) The exacerbation of the mother's health is happening now, so calling it self-defense is justified.

B) Calling it self-defense would only be justified when the mother's health is on the cusp of her death.

I think it's worth mentioning that it's one thing to say someone ""chose"" something and another to say that they chose to risk that thing occurring. When someone chooses to act in a way that they know that *thing* may fall through, they must be held responsible for taking care of the result. And in the context we are speaking of, being responsible and taking care of the result means not killing the child you created. 

&gt;Can happen even if you abort or miscarry, btw. And completely irrelevant to the abortion discussion, but you keep bringing it up. It could be the case that giving birth makes you immune to death, you still wouldn’t have the right to force it on anyone.

I brought it up because you are acting as if a fetus is a parasite. Parasites are always  parasites throughout their life, whether they are in a ""parasitic stage"" of their life cycle or not. If the fetus is a parasite, then every  other human is also a parasite. And generally speaking a parasite decreases the health of its host, while a fetus and mother have a beneficial relationship and increase each other's health.[I think this post does a better job of describing it than I can](http://www.cephalopodiatrist.com/2012/10/why-babies-arent-actually-parasites.html), written by a double duty mom and biologist.

&gt;Again this is a whole new argument, but I am going to briefly address it. It’s a very very small percentage of abortions that happen after 20 weeks, and mostly they are done because the ultrasound at 24 weeks shows abnormalities incompatible with life. I’ll stop there because this is a long discussion and is unrelated to the question of the legality of the large majority of abortions that happen. Please do some research, though, if you’re unfamiliar with why women get abortions after 20 weeks.

Citation? Because I think you need to do the research. All the reasarch I've done on this topic suggests that second and third trimester abortions happen less, not necessarily that they occur due to health reasons. And I've researched this A LOT, every time a prochoicers makes the claim. Regardless I've never found a source that says abortion after 16 weeks are preformed due to health or incompatible life reasons.

&gt;Forcing women to stay pregnant against their will is violence. (As is, by the way, taking someone’s organs without their consent). 

Again read what I said in response to this claim as well as u/socialworker80's response. 

&gt;Assuming that the fetus does have a right to life (different discussion), that doesn’t automatically override the mother’s right to defend her bodily autonomy.

Yes. Yes it does. It overrides her bodily autonomy because she chose to risk creating a being that uses her body. Generally speaking, again, we don't consider bodily autonomy  to override people's right to not be attacked. I find it funny that you are comparing going through a pregnancy to violence and abortion to a military officer defending himself or herself against the Taliban. General non-life threatening health reasons are not enough to justify abortion, as even pregnant women who want children experience them.  Also, 

&gt;**violence**:noun
behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something, 

I seem to be missing something here. Also, if you compare the fatality rate for pregnancy to the workplace fatality rate, multiplied by the number of extra hours worked over 18 years, paying child support is actually on average **significantly more deadly than carrying a pregnancy to term.** should these fathers be allowed to kill their children?

in response to the parenting and suicide issue: Mothers and fathers are legally obligated to care for and protect their children. If you find out your daughter is suicidal, and you totally ignore the problem, and your daughter ends up in the hospital, you can be charged with neglect. So no, when the person in need is your child, it's not the parent's choice whether or not to help. 

&gt;No, I don't think women who would try to abort are mentally ill.

Ok. I'm going to try to summarize this as quickly as I can. The reason I think women who try to kill their children or wish to kill their children are mentally ill is because the Mayo Clinic [defines mental illness](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/basics/definition/con-20033813) as ""Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior."" Per the sources on  why women have an abortion, I would say that the many factors that go into abortion could impact a woman's judgement and thinking, causing her to act in a way that she normally would not were she not under stress and unable to make a decision without other stressful factors playing in. And we label those who kill or wish to kill other innocent people as mentally ill.

Being mentally ill is not necessarily a bad thing; it is like any regular physical illness and it can be treated. We don't think schizophrenics or people  with BPD are bad people, but they have a mental illness that they must undergo treatment to keep in control of their actions or thoughts. 

&gt;So I want to double check here. You think forced organ donation is good. 

Wrong.

&gt;You think pregnant women should have someone else decide what they eat or drink, where they travel, where they live, etc. Because the fetus’s right to be alive and healthy outweighs the mother’s human rights to make decisions for herself? 

I don't think the fetus's right to live outweighs the mother's right to live. I think they are both equal and deserve equal rights.  The mother should not be able to kill her child simply because it is an inconvenience.

&gt;How would that even work? Who would you trust to make that decision? The government? Doctors? 

Probably doctors, since they are more experienced in the medical fields and would know what is the best route for the woman's health. 

&gt;Should this entity also get to decide to permanently sterilize women,

Where on earth did you get this idea. I said women shouldn't be able to kill their children, not that they shouldn't have any control over their bodies. You do realize I am female, right?

&gt; since it’s in charge of their bodies?

No, in charge of what they do to other people's bodies

&gt; Should it get to decide how many kids they’re allowed to have? 

You do realize this is what they do in China, right? Even if a woman wants to have children, if she already has one, they force her to kill her child.

&gt;This is what theyWho should get to decide who gets organs? If they’re all up for grabs, is it just a free market kind of thing? A punishment the courts can issue? Doesn’t this sound dystopian and terrifying to you?

Wow, you really jumped to a lot of conclusions and you are missing my main point: Abortion is wrong because it kills an innocent human being. That is all. That's why I'm against abortion, and that's why most prolifers are against abortion. We support the righ to live for the unborn. Again, if you were against rape or murder, would you budge on your stance if it negatively impacted the murderer or rapists' ""bodily autonomy"" in any way?

37,"I am floored that anyone could say that they are skeptical that sex is genuinely at its very root of existence for procreation. Every mammal procreates through sex. It is the only way to procreate. We are not born without the joining of sperm and egg. Even reptiles and fish have to join sperm and egg, just not by sex. 

The number of how many eggs implant or not and whether species have menopause or not, is irrelevant because we are all here because of the joining egg and sperm. 

Just because humans have been lucky enough to advance technologically to fight against infertility for the few lucky enough to access IVF and similar methods, it does nothing to change that fact. People certainly wouldn't seek out IVF just cus if they could just go with sex. 

Of course we treat medical conditions. We also try to prevent miscarriage and early labor when possible. My friend had to take heparin shots every day that she was pregnant to not have a miscarriage. 

Ask the donors why one thing is funded more than another. Ask why there is advertising to donate to one thing more than another. Why would it only be up to prolife to fund fertility research? That's like saying it is only up to women to fund heart disease research, as the leading cause of death in women is heart disease. So only smokers should fund lung cancer research because they get lung cancer more. 

I have an opinion question for you. Do you think that the fact that we are at our lowest birth rate in history, is in any way-even loosely-tied to abortion? We already have so few babies that are wanted implanting. Now we intentionally have fewer children because it is more practical. And we have had abortion since 1973. It is popularly estimated that there have been 58-59 million abortions since Roe v Wade. 

That Petri dish thought experiment always makes me think of this: If you were in a burning building and there were 2 toddlers, one who was your child, and you could only save one...which would you save? 

Because I mean,

1 What if the eggs were yours and then toddler was yours? Save the toddler. 

2 What if you can save the eggs and the toddler? Save both. 

3 What if the eggs were the last eggs ever for you period, and you have no kids? And you have no idea where this toddler came from? Does it matter if the toddler is your neighbor? Does your neighbor have 5 other children?

4 What if the eggs were some random person's and the toddler was yours?

We have different ways of prioritizing things ",1,1495745623,2017-05-25 16:53:43
38,"u/SarcasticAce is using the example of dragging someone into your house and killing them very specifically. A baby doesn't materialize itself of its own will, rather it is brought forth. Conception/implantation = dragging someone into your home. Since abortion only results in the baby's loss of life, abortion = murdering the person that you drug into your house. The person that you killed was innocent hence the baby is innocent. 

She does not think that forced organ donation is 'good'. You see, prochoice argues that women should be able to choose because we don't force Americans to donate their organs. But prolife adamantly disagrees that use of the uterus is akin to organ donation. The uterus is not required for the woman to live, and the uterus does not leave her body, and its use is not permanent. 

When the organ donation argument is pressed after this response is given, it leads to an additional dismantling of the argument by prolife. So prochoice says, 'Well I think that it IS forced organ donation regardless of your retort, and since NO ONE forces donation because it is OBVIOUSLY immoral and crazy, that is why abortion will NEVER be illegal again'. And then I say, 'Guess what? Forced or at least coerced organ donation is becoming a thing. Ever heard of [Presumed Consent ](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-12/presumed-consent-and-americas-organ-donor-shortage?context=amp) and [Opt-out](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/frances-new-opt-out-organ-donation-system-is-a-good-idea.html) programs?

40,"&gt;Procreation is why [sex] truly exists, so that we can continue our species. 

I'm skeptical about this claim.  Did you see the math I did earlier?  Even if no one used birth control and couples only had sex once a week (the average I found) and one of those times was always when the woman was ovulating, only ~5% of sexual intercourse would result in pregnancy.  That's even excluding the sex that happens with pregnant women!  Obviously sex is the most common way that humans procreate, but most human sex does not result in procreation.

I think you can point to some evidence to suggest that humans evolved to have sex for more than procreation- hidden ovulation, menopause, the clitoris.  Whereas species like cats, you can see that sex only happens for procreation and ovulation is triggered by sex.

&gt;They see failure to [implant] as a natural act or death in a sense.

I've seen this argument before and I don't buy it.  The natural-ness of a death doesn't give us any reason to avoid searching for a fix.  Cancer, heart disease, infection, etc etc are all natural, but we spend lots of time and money trying to prolong ill people's lives.  Where is the pro-life demand for research about miscarriages?  If a fertilized egg is a person, miscarriage is the biggest cause of death by far!  It should get more funding than cancer etc.  And it doesn't, not even a drop in the bucket.

You've probably seen the thought experiment with the petri dish of fertilized eggs and the toddler, right?  They're both in a burning building, which do you save?  There are multiple eggs in the dish, only one toddler.  Do you really see those eggs as people as much as the toddler?

I haven't seen that.  I've seen bills to make it as hard to get viagara or a gun as it is to get abortion I think.  Mostly to make a point. :)

&gt;They don't concern themselves with periods and sperm for obvious reasons

I don't think it's obvious to everyone.  When you see personhood on a continuum rather than black and white, sperm and eggs are only slightly less potential people than unimplanted fertilized eggs.  ",2,1495738997,2017-05-25 15:03:17
41,"It is so refreshing to hear you say that. I absolutely believe that anyone can be racist, etc. The thought experiment boiled down to whether or not someone buys into the prevailing liberal belief structure that such people cannot be racist or misogynistic. If you went to my undergraduate or graduate school... because of my chosen areas of study, they would have beaten into your head that:

1. A black person cannot be racist. 

2. Thus reverse racism is not a thing. Focus on unpacking White Privilege. 

3. You want to hear the opinions of a black lesbian more than anyone else, because per standpoint theory she is the most ""woke"" because she has a triple oppression of black, female, gay. 

4. An oppressed woman from countries where she is forced to marry, wearing Hijab, circumcised, etc is certainly not misogynistic. 

u/SarcasticAce has not only repeatedly been called a man during debate, but also a misogynist. And I actually have never seen her say to anyone what she said to you. This usually happens because, from my experience, many prochoice people in the end resort to telling prolife women, that they hate other women, or that they just want to punish women for having sex. In the end, if she hasn't already she is the only one who can answer why she specifically said 'mentally ill'. Though I tell you that she is brash. She gives zero fucks. I don't know if she had a finite number of fucks and just used them up, or if she has no fucks by default. ",2,1495737761,2017-05-25 14:42:41
42,"Really? Pleasure is intentionally such a broad word. Don't you think? I am not sure that it does matter necessarily in the prochoice viewpoint, yet the prolife viewpoint believes that sex is a very specific action with very specific intended outcomes, one of which is the most obvious procreation. Procreation is why it truly exists, so that we can continue our species. The feel good aspect just keeps us wanting to do it, no? TaDaa! I am Captain Obvious! Anyway, that is just as meaningful to prolife as the belief that the unborn are just as valuable as the born. 

I saw you mentioned to u/SarcasticAce that so many fertilized eggs do not implant. That is so true. I think that is part of the reason why people have always used the phrase ""the miracle of life"". Prolife knows this about implantation. They see failure to do so as a natural act or death in a sense. Of course no funerals because there is nothing to have one for...it's gone. Most women never even know that there was a chemical pregnancy. Without implantation, it isn't even a miscarriage. But women monitoring for fertility issues notice it, and it represents loss to them. I have noticed that some in the prochoice crowd do not make this connection, or they misunderstand it. 

Do you remember that lady that introduced that bill or something that would fine men for ejaculating? Many in her camp thought she was clever. But she wasn't at all because she completely missed the mark on what prolife even believes. They don't concern themselves with periods and sperm for obvious reasons. Yet I have heard this in debates from prochoice. It doesn't make any sense.

43,"Again going to try to shorten this.  I’m ignoring some of what you’ve said that seems irrelevant, but again, that’s just in my judgement of things so feel free to bring it up again if you want.

Basically your argument is that the woman choose to have sex so she has to accept the fetus.  Then you give examples of me forcing someone into my house and killing them for being there.  Let me ask you this.  Are there alternatives to just killing the person on your property?  It’s not clear to me in your hypothetical if that’s the case.  If not, then no, I don’t think it’s in anyway immoral to kill someone who is violating you for months, even if your actions put them there.  I’m not saying you must kill them, but I think it’s a choice each person would have to make on their own.  

We’ve already talked about a more realistic comparison: I cause a car crash, someone will die if I don’t give them some part of my body, and, correct me if I’m wrong, you think I should be legally forced to give them an organ to keep them alive since I caused the accident, right?  And you also seem to think this is already happening, that live people are being forced to donate organs against their will?  And you think that’s a good thing and morally right?  Just want to make sure I understand.

&gt; Mere health problems should not be reason enough to have an abortion. Her life would have to be in danger for me to support her right to terminate her child.

Well that’s not legally how self-defense works.  I can fear bodily harm, not just death, and act to defend myself.  Look at your definition.  No one should be forced to endure child birth (imminent physical harm).  If it’s forced, that’s unlawful.  It meets all the requirements.  

&gt; fetuses send stem cells to the mother to help heal a heart condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy

Can happen even if you abort or miscarry, btw.  And completely irrelevant to the abortion discussion, but you keep bringing it up.  It could be the case that giving birth makes you immune to death, you still wouldn’t have the right to force it on anyone.

&gt; So what's your view on a woman who decides to be 'irresponsible' in your view and waits till the second or third trimester to kill her child?

Again this is a whole new argument, but I am going to briefly address it.  It’s a very very small percentage of abortions that happen after 20 weeks, and mostly they are done because the ultrasound at 24 weeks shows abnormalities incompatible with life.

Forcing women to stay pregnant against their will is violence.  (As is, by the way, taking someone’s organs without their consent).  Assuming that the fetus does have a right to life (different discussion), that doesn’t automatically override the mother’s right to defend her bodily autonomy.

&gt;Parents’ rights vs children’s rights

Who do you think decides what medical care children get?  When babies are born super premature, who decides whether to let them die or try to keep them alive (and likely disabled)?  Who decides when a kid with cancer has had enough and stops getting chemo?  Parents make life and death medical decisions for their children.  Do you think someone else should make that call?

No, I don’t think women who would try to self abort are mentally ill.

My thoughts about suicide- If someone were threatening suicide, I would try to get them mental health treatment, yes.  However, if they had fully explored treatment and were still suffering, I would not stand in the way of them committing suicide, no.  I don’t think it’s possible to impulsively get an abortion, but it is possible to impulsively throw yourself off a bridge.

So I want to double check here.  You think forced organ donation is good.

See previous response: 

&gt;Wait. The hypothetical should be this: your autonomy becomes violated because of something you did. Let's say you put this person in a position where they would be touching your body against your will; tied them to you, knocked them out,etc, made it impossible for them to get away from you without dying for a minimum of 5 months. Would it be morally justifiable for you to kill this person, even though your own actions put the person there?

&gt;I don't think so. And at the very least, if your actions cause someone to enter your property with no control or intentions of their own, I and many others would not support the legality of just killing anyone in your property.

&gt;The hypothetical I fixed for you is not exact of course, but it is far closer to abortion than the example you cited.

To address the rest of your argument: Are you suggesting that children who are actively being harmed, or in an environment where they could be killed, should(?)just stay in that situation? Like, who cares?!1!!1! It's all about parents rights, children's rights be damned!! Under the law, parents have a natural right to their children, but not to harm them. I think abortion falls into the harm category.

&gt;it is insulting and grossly sexist to equate wanting an abortion to being mentally ill.

K. This reminds me, you never answered me when I said: ""Yes, that is a reason for me to think someone is mentally ill. I have read posts on Twox and here where certain pregnant women are asked what they would do if abortion were outlawed. The answers varied from throwing oneself down the stairs to overdosing on vitamins to punching themselves in the chest and stomach areas to kill the child. You don't consider that mentally ill?""

I'm assuming you don't. Whatever. Moving on.

&gt;I’d like you to clarify a couple of things. Do you think women should get to choose their own medical care? Should a woman with cancer get to choose if she accepts chemo? Obviously the doctor would have to be willing to give it to her, but assuming the doctor is offering a course of treatment, should the woman get to choose if she takes that treatment?

None of these situations are comparable to abortion. So I'll ask you a question and bite. Would you tell a suicidal person ""kill yourself if you want, I'm not going to force you into treatment""? Of course not! If someone was standing on a ledge, readying herself to jump off, you'd call the police to talk her down and take her to treatment.


&gt;Do you think pregnant women should get to choose what they eat? If they take a prenatal vitamin? Where they travel? Where they live? What choices of a pregnant woman’s do you think you should get to make for her?

As long as the choices she makes do not harm the fetus or herself in general, feel free. Otherwise, sorry to say no.

&gt;If a person is violating me, even unintentionally, I am under no obligation to accept it. 

The difference is that in the case of pregnancy, it is your fault that the fetus is ""violating"", as you say, your bodily autonomy. *Your choices* put the fetus in that position. This is the main difference between the examples you cited. e.g. Your example here:

&gt;If someone were sleep-molesting me, would I have to just tolerate it? No. I get to decide who uses my body, when they do it, and how they’re allowed to. Intention doesn’t matter. With abortion, there is no way to end the violation without killing. That is the minimal amount of force necessary for me to assert my right to my body.

Wait. The hypothetical should be this: your autonomy becomes violated because of something you did. Let's say you put this person in a position where they would be touching your body against your will; tied them to you, knocked them out,etc, made it impossible for them to get away from you  without dying for a minimum of 5 months.

&gt;Yes, absolutely. 1. Being pregnant and giving birth is way riskier than having an abortion. 2. Even if it’s an “easy” pregnancy, childbirth is painful. Recovery takes at least 6 weeks. A large percentage of women have long term physical impacts from giving birth. A fetus that will have to be born is absolutely threatening my wellbeing. Even if that’s not why most women are getting them, that’s why their legal right to access abortion should be protected. 

Mere health problems should not be reason enough to have an abortion. Her life would have to be in danger for me  to support her right to terminate her child.[please take a look at this](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html)

&gt;Again, the resulting estimates are generally lower than those reported based on the AGI surveys. **For cases of risk to the mother's physical health, the state-based estimates vary significantly but are all lower than the AGI-based estimates, and in all but the case of Minnesota are lower by at least a factor of 4. For cases of threat to the mother's life, despite the factor of 7 range in state-level percentages among the three states, the derived national estimates are quite consistent, in the range 0.08-0.13%.**

Anyways, the baby and the mother’s bodies usually cooperate together to help the pregnancy go smoothly, some researchers have experimented and discovered that fetuses send stem cells to the mother to help heal a heart condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy. Women with this condition overcome their condition faster than any other group of heart failure patients.

&gt;I think there’s an argument to be made that the fetus is threatening these women in other ways that aren’t physical, but I don’t want to derail.

1/  that isn't life threatening and also isn't a logical reason to give for the right to kill your child

2/ again, and I hate to be predictable with my definition shtick, but **""the person must reasonably believe that their use of force was necessary to preventimminent, unlawful physical harm.""** - Please, take in account the word imminent. Your examples are so far from ""I will die if I don't get an abortion"" which pro-choicers like to portray. It's complete BS. 

&gt;Why do you think that isn’t the case currently? Why do you think no one is fighting to make laws enforcing THAT violation of bodily autonomy?

1/ well, organ donation occurs [without consent](http://www.hospicepatients.org/paul-a-byrne-md-do-your-organs-belong-to-the-government-uniform-anatomical-gift-act-06-03-08.html), for one. And we have pew research [polls](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/5-facts-about-abortion/) that shows that 37% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal, and that 44% of Americans believe abortion is morally wrong. So there's that.

2/ how many people believe something is right doesn't necessarily make it so and it doesn't mean the minority need to sit down and shut up, else marital rape would probably still be legal. 

&gt;And I am saying that they are owning their shit by admitting they aren’t prepared to parent or put the child up for adoption.

Nope, not really. You kind of just contradicted yourself with the ""owning their shit... admitting they aren't prepared to parent"" stuff. So what's your view on a woman who decides to be 'irresponsible' in your view and waits till the second or third trimester to kill her child? I know what you are going to say, ""she should have gotten an abortion sooner"", well that would be acting ""responsibly"" in your view and I thought you said women shouldn't have to be held responsible for having sex and creating life, women shouldn't be held responsible for not having an abortion before 20 weeks either then.

 &gt;They are owning their shit by taking care of themselves and their families. You don’t have to agree with me. I don’t expect to convince you. But this is a matter of perspective. We’re allowed to make different choices about our lives. We’re not allowed to force our perspectives on other people and expect them to accept our morality in place of their own.

We don't legislate morality, but it must be against the law to violate the rights of others. Abortion violates the right of a baby to live: it is an act of violence against another human being.  And because abortion is violent, so it falls within the realm of criminal law. Protecting humans from violence is the primitive purpose of the state. And you may argue that we accept violence in certain situations - well, that's true in the cases of self defense and just war. But it is not true when an innocent life is taken.

Intention isn’t magic.  If a person is violating me, even unintentionally, I am under no obligation to accept it.  If someone were sleep-molesting me, would I have to just tolerate it?  No.  I get to decide who uses my body, when they do it, and how they’re allowed to.  Intention doesn’t matter.  With abortion, there is no way to end the violation without killing.  That is the minimal amount of force necessary for me to assert my right to my body.

58,"&gt; Surgery doesn't always save lives. Are you kidding me? Have you heard of plastic surgery? Or things like wisdom teeth removal? Surgery, and medicine in general, exist to improve people's lives and their health. Which is exactly what an abortion does for a pregnant woman.

1/ Surgery, again, was INVENTED to save lives. **Operative word. That is still its function at hospitals.** Can't we all agree that cosmetic surgery is a social advent that mostly exploits our own self loathing? Fake boobs, nose jobs and tummy tucks are not the same as breast reconstruction after cancer or resolving cleft palate; cosmetic surgery does not save lives. The first surgeries ever done on this globe were to treat illness and injury. Look it up.

In 2008 the WHO estimated 234 million surgeries per year worldwide. And that accounted for only WHO member countries. In 2011 15 million had plastic surgery worldwide.

Hence, the whole purpose of surgery is saving lives. Using it to kill babies and fix your droopy boobs doesn't change that fact. By the way, abortion has plenty of  dangerous physical side effects(not to mention the danger it puts the woman's life if she decides to get pregnant again: http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-side-effects/ 

&gt;What makes you say that? Just because that's what you want to believe?

It was you who said banning abortions leads to more back alley abortions. Not me. I was just responding and adding my opinion to prebirth abortions. You even brought up this scenario. Creating strawmen is fun, but it's not realistic. 

&gt;You brought rape up to say that a rapist doesn't have the right to violate their victim's bodily autonomy. Agreed. My point is that neither does a fetus.

I said that anti rape laws exist to protect people. It was you who compared continuing an unwanted pregnancy to term.

&gt;None of that matters. It's in her body and it's unwanted. It does not have permission to be there.
Let's say I am consensually having sex with someone, they did not force themselves on me, they did not invade me, they are inside my body with my permission. But oh! I no longer want to have sex! I don't want them in my body anymore! I revoke my consent, and they must leave. Their presence is no longer wanted. If they refuse and stay inside of me, that is rape. It is a violation of my body without my consent. In the same way that a fetus who doesn't leave when I tell it to is violating my body. No force necessary for the violation to occur.

The unborn child is not, in any scientific or medical sense, an intruder or a parasite. These words have meanings, and unborn babies do not fit the bill. Sorry. If a you withdraw consent during sex, and the person forces themselves upon you anyway, it is different than pregnancy because the person in question is in control of themselves and has intent. Again, a human embryo/fetus does not, and its the woman's actions that caused it to be in that position. 

Furthermore, it might seem pleasant to refer to abortion as a woman ‘withdrawing consent’ from her child, but the procedure goes beyond this. During a ‘termination,’ the baby is actively killed. It is crushed, dismembered, poisoned, or torn apart. It is killed, intentionally and purposefully. An unborn child is exactly where he or she is supposed to be. The child couldn't be anywhere else. 

&gt;You don't have to have experienced it to know that pregnancy and childbirth are uncomfortable/painful. 96% of pregnancies have some kind of complication. The physical recovery time for childbirth is at least 6 weeks, for an uncomplicated vaginal birth. If someone said they were going to mess with your body in uncomfortable ways for 9 months then beat you up so bad it took 6 weeks to recover, wouldn't you feel justified in using whatever force necessary to protect yourself?

""Protect"" myself? Are you kidding me right now? You are kidding, right? You don't actually believe a fetus is attacking or threatening the mother's life and will continue to do so unless she kills it, do you? Surely if all cases of abortion were self defense, the mother-baby relationship would not be beneficial symbiosis. The only case where abortion could be considered self defense is the life of the mother, and that is such a small percentage of all abortions it is hardly a reason why abortion should be allowed in all cases. 

&gt;Well it can be... https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system

And? 1% of all abortions are preformed to save the mother's life.

You literally have about a 1 
/5,000 chance of dying in childbirth in a DEVELOPED country. That is 0.02% (and this includes woman who are not exhibiting normal healthy pregnancies). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death
My chances of dying from the flu are 3,697/100, 000. That is 3.5%. My chances of dying of the flu are significantly higher than dying from child birth. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/flu.htm
Come on. You can make a better argument.

&gt;For some people it is absolutely just as unwanted.

It's not as harmful. And again with the unwanted thing: how does this determine the value of someone's life?

59,"&gt;I have a right to self defense. If you take that away because the thing violating me is a fetus, you are violating my rights and giving the fetus more rights than any person has.

I read through your comment again, and though you attempt you justify abortion as self defense, you have not provided any sources to prove your point. As a matter of fact, the mother and epfetus have a beneficial symbiotic relationship, for example if the mother has heart problems, the fetus sends stem cells to help repair it. Again, you haven't provided any proof to substantiate your claim. You just keep saying abortion is a method of self defense. That doesn't prove anything. And not to sound like a massive cunt, but you're wrong. 

[self defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_(United_States)

&gt;**""In cases involving non-deadly force, this means that the person must reasonably believe that their use of force was necessary to prevent imminent, unlawful physical harm. When the use of deadly force is involved in a self-defense claim, the person must also reasonably believe that their use of deadly force is immediately necessary to prevent the other's infliction or great bodily harm or death.""**

The definition clearly states that self defense is used to prevent bodily harm. Abortion in 99% of cases is not used for this purpose. Your source even admits this, and your source- PP's right hand Institute- is prochoice. No misogyny there.

&gt;Yes, I do. It's sad, she probably should not be pregnant or parent her child, but I do think she has a right to do whatever she wants to her body. As do our laws- it's not illegal for pregnant women to drink or smoke.

And at the same time you support abortion because that same child may experience health defects and it is unfair to the child. Lol

&gt;it is insulting and grossly sexist to equate being pregnant with being mentally ill. There is nothing wrong with a woman's brain just because she gets pregnant! Do you also think pregnant women shouldn't be allowed to drive or leave the house

Another strawman! Yeah, these are easy to defeat so I can't blame you exactly, but for the last time, I did not compare being mentally ill to being pregnant; I compared wanting to kill your child, whether it is born or unborn, and even being desperate enough for its death that you go to the extent of attempting to murder it with a coat hanger, to mental illness.

To an extent,for her health and the health of her child. You may call me misogynistic if you wish. If wanting the child and its mother to remain healthy through the pregnancy makes me a misogynist then so be it.

I didn't say they were the same or that you said that exactly. I said that they are on the same grounds.

&gt;Here's a more reasonable comparison. I'm driving drunk with my kid in the car. We get in an accident. They are injured and will die without some of my blood. Am I legally obligated to donate blood to save them? My actions put them in a position to need blood, they don't have control or intent over the situation. What are my legal obligations?

1/ If I am directly responsible for someone's condition and the actions I took are ones in which I knew there was a chance of creating a needy person, and they would literally die without my help, then yeah I would support overriding bodily autonomy.

2/ You hinted it. Apologies if that's not what upyou meant.

&gt;No... they're not. Tell me where time, energy, comfort, or mental capacity are located on a body. 

She must use her time and energy to commit to actions she may not want to. Her mental capacity is located in her brain. These are not technically physical aspects, but they are *part of her body* in the same way your personality is a part of you. So you consider a woman's body the only consideration about her worth, what rights she has? You don't care about her time, her energy, her mental status? That's kinda sexist, to only think about a woman's body.


&gt; sorry it makes you sad... what makes me sad is treating women like walking incubators...saying they don't have the mental capacity to decide who gets to use their bodies ...

No one is saying that. We are saying that women should OWN THEIR SHIT and go through pregnancy because their actions resulted in the creation of a human being, and they should not be allowed to kill it just because it is inconvenient to them.

&gt;child abuse, that makes me sad too and is higher in places without abortion. 

so you're saying a child only matters if he or she is loved and treated well? A person's value is based on how well they are treated by others? I was a victim of child abuse, yet I am happy to be alive. Your example is morally deficit as it assumes that because a child might experience hardship, it is better to kill him or her. If I make exceptions because the child is unwanted, will be abused, or will have a disability, etc,  I am thereby also saying people matter because of their utility to others who have the desire to use them. That is unfair as they are all human beings even if they have faced hardships. If my mother had made the decision to abort me based on the example you gave, I would be dead simply because no one thought my life would be of value due to possible hardships.

&gt;It makes me sad that you think you should get to have authority over other people's bodies for any length of time, 9 months or 9 minutes, because of feelings their choices give you.

oh ok? so you'd say fuck all to any kid who demands labour from their mother due to its needs? you'll kill simply because fetuses 'challenge' ""a woman's right to choose""? you'll support the right to kill people who prevent you from making 'free choice'?  a woman asks you to support her right to kill children she is unable to give up for adoption - WILL YOU JOIN IN?

if you do - then you are evil

&gt;Yeah a woman is taking the blame/credit when she chooses to get an abortion. She is taking responsibility, owning up to the results of her actions, and dealing with them. 

No she's not - she's kicking it out of the equation so she doesn't have to deal with it.

&gt;By your own definition, she is being responsible. She's not blaming anybody else, 

except her child

&gt;she's not avoiding thinking about it or just going with the flow. She's facing her unwanted pregnancy 

By killing the result of her actions so she doesn't have to deal with them

&gt;and getting an abortion.

By hiring a child assassin to crush her child's skull and sucking it through a tube before selling it like old engine parts at a garage sale.

That's not being responsible: it's hiding from consequences.

&gt;It's mostly financial issues that drive abortion. And you want to argue that it is mentally ill for these women to choose to abort? 

Read what I said about negative impacts and such. It doesn't affect the morality of the abortion.

&gt;That's so insulting. I don't even really have the words for you. If you decided you couldn't afford a new car that I wanted you to buy and I said that made you mentally ill, wouldn't you be incredulous? 

Your comparisons are getting sillier by the minute. Firstly, they do not contain another human being in danger because of something's i did. Second of all, it can only be remotely comparable to ""terminating a pregnancy"" if I took unreasonable loans. You seem really insecure man

&gt;There's no reason to think that someone making a different choice than you'd like them to is mentally ill. That's also insulting to real mental illness.

A different choice that harms a human being? Yes, that is a reason for me to think someone is mentally ill. I have read posts on Twox and here where certain pregnant women are asked what they would do if abortion were outlawed. The answers varied from throwing oneself down the stairs to overdosing on vitamins to punching themselves in the chest and stomach areas to kill the child. You don't consider that mentally ill?

&gt;If you don't believe that women are the authority on their bodies and lives, 

Only problem here is it isn't just her body she's authorizing termination on. 

&gt;if you think the state, doctors (which can be women, so that really doesn't make any sense), 

Quite the strawman.

When did I say doctors can't be women? I was saying that pregnant women do not know better than their doctors. Should I have said ""including women"" so you don't feel that I left women out? And then you accuse me of ignoring the obvious.

&gt; or you are better equipped to decide for them who is allowed to be inside their bodies...

You are ignoring my entire point, which is that it is not just her body she is making decisions for. Are you purposefully ignoring me? 

&gt; yes that is the very definition of misogyny.

K

&gt; Why do you think anyone else should get not just a say but complete control over a woman's body? 

No one should, but when it is not her body she is making decision over, then it becomes the business of others because you don't have the right to kill an innocent human being.

&gt;What issues do you have with women that you see them as sub-human?

It is a sad time indeed when wanting to protect helpless babies is seen as wanting to control women and seeing them as subhuman. Are you going to wish pregnancy and plague and death on me now, since according to you I am worse than a million Hitlers combined?

&gt;They are different, but that's not even what I said. You can't see the difference between instructions for a healthy pregnancy and a doctor deciding whether or not a woman stays pregnant? 

It is not just her body, so my answer is relevant. Are you going to debate me or keep repeating yourself when you don't like the answer?

&gt;In the other case she has become livestock for the doctor.

Ah okay, so if abortion is banned women can compare the agony of not being allowed to have abortions to slavery and its counterparts? Glad you sorted that one out for me.

&gt;Do you agree that sex exists for 2 reasons, pleasure and procreation?  

Not only those two reasons.  http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/why-people-have-sex",1,1495649543,2017-05-24 14:12:23
65,"&gt;surgery was invented to save lives, not take them. 

Surgery doesn't always save lives.  Are you kidding me?  Have you heard of plastic surgery?  Or things like wisdom teeth removal?  Surgery, and medicine in general, exist to improve people's lives and their health.  Which is exactly what an abortion does for a pregnant woman.

&gt;If a woman is so desperate to kill her child that she attempts to murder it with a coat hanger, she is probably suffering from a mental illness, not just pregnancy.

What makes you say that?  Just because that's what you want to believe?


&gt;That's where I got the idea that you were bringing rape into this conversation.

You brought rape up to say that a rapist doesn't have the right to violate their victim's bodily autonomy.  Agreed.  My point is that neither does a fetus.

&gt; The child did not force itself upon the mother. The child did not invade the mother. At no point in time did the child forcefully enter the mother's body. It was conceived there, so it cannot be said to have come from the outside and invaded the mother. 

None of that matters.  It's in her body and it's unwanted.  It does not have permission to be there.  

Let's say I am consensually having sex with someone, they did not force themselves on me, they did not invade me, they are inside my body with my permission.  But oh!  I no longer want to have sex!  I don't want them in my body anymore!  I revoke my consent, and they must leave.  Their presence is no longer wanted.  If they refuse and stay inside of me, that is rape.  It is a violation of my body without my consent.  In the same way that a fetus who doesn't leave when I tell it to is violating my body.  No force necessary for the violation to occur. 

&gt; I understand that it is painful, but that doesn't prove it is at all similar to rape. It is true that as a virgin, I have never been pregnant, so I cannot fully understand what it means 

You don't have to have experienced it to know that pregnancy and childbirth are uncomfortable/painful.  96% of pregnancies have some kind of complication.  The physical recovery time for childbirth is at least 6 weeks, for an uncomplicated vaginal birth.  If someone said they were going to mess with your body in uncomfortable ways for 9 months then beat you up so bad it took 6 weeks to recover, wouldn't you feel justified in using whatever force necessary to protect yourself?

&gt;it doesn't look like a life-threatening disease to carry a pregnancy to term

Well it can be...  https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system

&gt;Honestly, the way some people talk about pregnancy, you'd think it was a disease like STDs or strep throat or cancer.

For some people it is absolutely just as unwanted.",2,1495649093,2017-05-24 14:04:53
66,"&gt;Right, but you were basing your argument on the same grounds as abortion being comparable to natural death because in some cases conception is not likely. 

No, that's not at all what I said.

2/ Your analogy is flawed because an intruder has control and intent. A zygote/embryo/fetus doesn't. In fact it's the woman's actions (through consensual sex) that puts the zygote into her uterus, and therefore would be more akin to you dragging an unconscious homeless person into your house then shooting them. Your comparison is purposefully deceptive.

Here's a more reasonable comparison.  I'm driving drunk with my kid in the car.  We get in an accident.  They are injured and will die without some of my blood.  Am I legally obligated to donate blood to save them?  My actions put them in a position to need blood, they don't have control or intent over the situation.  What are my legal obligations?

&gt;So basically abortion is good because you say so. Right. 

I'm not saying it's universally good or bad.  Not sure where you got that at all.

&gt;Are a mother's time, energy, comfort, mental capacity not part of her body?

No... they're not.  Tell me where time, energy, comfort, or mental capacity are located on a body.

&gt;It is sad that so many people have decided that 9 months out of their entire lives was more valuable than the potential life span of the people with no rights, which is estimated at 79 years each. It is very sad that they don't have the right to live because someone decided that based off of their stage of development and location, they did not deserve rights. It is sad that so many of these children are mercilessly cut up into bits and sucked through a vacuum. It is sad that they are not even treated with human decency even after they have been murdered, but rather sold like old toys at a yard sale.

I'm sorry it makes you sad.  What makes me sad is treating women like walking incubators.  Like saying they don't have the mental capacity to decide who gets to use their bodies in what way.  Or child abuse, that makes me sad too and is higher in places without abortion.  It makes me sad that you think you should get to have authority over other people's bodies for any length of time, 9 months or 9 minutes, because of feelings their choices give you.

&gt;I realize that you are prochoice, yes. I asked the questions because I hoped that as a self-proclaimed pro-choicer you would be open to giving wider choices for the mother.

How is taking away the option for abortion giving her wider choices?  One fewer option is more options?  

&gt;What? Things will never be perfect so we can't ban abortion? 

No.  Things aren't perfect so women who choose abortion are coerced by imperfect reality.  If all those things were fixed I would feel like women could make reproductive choices more freely, including the choice to abort.

&gt; But since you don't consider it a right as a choice to run me over- why the double standard?

I think I do have the right to choose to run you over in certain circumstances, such as: you're threatening me and running you over is the only escape open to me.

&gt; Responsible: being the primary cause of something and so able to be blamed or credited for it.
Abortion just allows you a ticket out of taking responsibility for your actions. 

Yeah a woman is taking the blame/credit when she chooses to get an abortion.  She is taking responsibility, owning up to the results of her actions, and dealing with them.  By your own definition, she is being responsible.  She's not blaming anybody else, she's not avoiding thinking about it or just going with the flow.  She's facing her unwanted pregnancy and getting an abortion.

&gt;I have, but I don't see how that defeats my argument. Abortion kills a human being. Therefore, abortion is wrong.

So is it wrong to be in the military?  Is it wrong to defend yourself if someone is threatening you?  Is it wrong to withhold your organs from people who will die without them?  I think very few people believe all killing is wrong, though maybe you are one of them.


&gt;here is some recent data on abortion reasons, though it limited to a few states. But you get the idea.

Here's some data without that limitation and without such abyssal response rates: https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdf   ""The reasons most frequently cited were that having a child would interfere with a woman’s education, work
or ability to care for dependents (74%); that she could not afford a baby now (73%); and that she did not want to be a
single mother or was having relationship problems (48%).""

It's mostly financial issues that drive abortion.  And you want to argue that it is mentally ill for these women to choose to abort?  That's so insulting.  I don't even really have the words for you.  If you decided you couldn't afford a new car that I wanted you to buy and I said that made you mentally ill, wouldn't you be incredulous?  There's no reason to think that someone making a different choice than you'd like them to is mentally ill.  That's also insulting to real mental illness.

&gt;Ohhhhh no... wait... this stuff about doctors knowing better then their patients and being prolifers is... misogynistic? 

If you don't believe that women are the authority on their bodies and lives, if you think the state, doctors (which can be women, so that really doesn't make any sense), or you are better equipped to decide for them who is allowed to be inside their bodies... yes that is the very definition of misogyny.  Why do you think anyone else should get not just a say but complete control over a woman's body?  What issues do you have with women that you see them as sub-human?


&gt;&gt;""Here's how to take care of your body"" vs ""here's how I demand you use your body against your will because I know better than you do""? This is highly problematic and deserves some thought on your part, please.

&gt;No, I can't see the difference between telling a pregnant woman how to take care of herself and telling her how to take care of the human she created. 

They are different, but that's not even what I said.  You can't see the difference between instructions for a healthy pregnancy and a doctor deciding whether or not a woman stays pregnant?  In one case, the doctor is advising how to accomplish a goal the woman has.  In the other case she has become livestock for the doctor.

&gt;I'd like to know how telling someone that they can't kill someone else is a violation of their rights. I'm not asking this to be a cunt, I'm asking it because I'm genuinely curious and have yet to hear a good defense. 

I have a right to self defense.  If you take that away because the thing violating me is a fetus, you are violating my rights and giving the fetus more rights than any person has.

&gt;If you really believe that a woman’s body is autonomous, then you must defend a mother who does things that could seriously harm her unborn child, even if she hasn’t chosen to abort it.

Yes, I do.  It's sad, she probably should not be pregnant or parent her child, but I do think she has a right to do whatever she wants to her body.  As do our laws- it's not illegal for pregnant women to drink or smoke.

&gt;But psych ward and suicidal patients don't have the autonomy to do what they want.

It is insulting and grossly sexist to equate being pregnant with being mentally ill.  There is nothing wrong with a woman's brain just because she gets pregnant!  Do you also think pregnant women shouldn't be allowed to drive or leave the house or choose what they eat?   ",2,1495649086,2017-05-24 14:04:46

You are not misogynistic because you are a female ex Muslim who left Islam in part due to their misogynistic practices.

That is why we get that information from our mothers and grandmothers, our OBGYN's, the internet and books, as well as pregnancy and birthing classes at the hospital. Sure, there is instinct involved. But instinct doesn't for example, tell us that late in pregnancy we should sleep on our left side to increase blood flow to the fetus.

Right, but you were basing your argument on the same grounds as abortion being comparable to natural death because in some cases conception is not likely. Natural death isn't the same as artificial human induced abortion. It's still an argument for abortion or against fetal rights for the reason my comment illustrated.

2/ Yes, I am consistent, because not one of the situations you cited involves causing the death of another human being that you caused to be in a situation.

&gt;If I dragged someone to my house and they refused to leave when I asked them to, I would have a right to defend myself, certainly. There's no ""lesser force"" when it comes to abortion. I could ask a visitor to leave. There's no way to politely ask a fetus to evacuate your uterus.

Your analogy is flawed because an intruder has control and intent.  A zygote/embryo/fetus doesn't. In fact it's the woman's actions (through consensual sex) that puts the zygote into her uterus, and therefore would be more akin to you dragging an unconscious homeless person into your house then shooting them. Your comparison is purposefully deceptive. 


&gt;The time it takes to secure a child with a responsible adult is not in any way comparable to 9 months of pregnancy plus giving birth. It's not completely black and white. Also, I'm ""forcing"" the mother to keep the fetus until she can get to the doctor, too. Or rather, the practicalities of life are, just like the mom of a child. I have legal obligations to that child that are in force until I pass them off. I have no such obligations to a fetus. Because there is no alternative to abortion if I no longer want to be pregnant. There is an alternative to child abandonment.

So basically abortion is good because you say so. Right.
Are a mother's time, energy, comfort, mental capacity not part of her body?

It is sad that so many people have decided that 9 months out of their entire lives was more valuable than the potential life span of the people with no rights, which is estimated at 79 years each.

I realize that you are prochoice, yes. I asked the questions because I hoped that as a self-proclaimed pro-choicer you would be open to giving wider choices for the mother. 

&gt;Again, what? To me, for a woman to freely choose she should have access to affordable food, shelter, education/employment, childcare, etc etc. This isn't the case now, and there are a lot of barriers in place between the present and the socialist society I dream of. 

What? Things will never be perfect so we can't ban abortion? That's like saying if you can't stop ALL of the injustices you should not ban them. We can try, but not everything can be solved. It is inevitable there will be something wrong, and the reason the law exists- to protect people - and so we can punish those who violate other's rights.

&gt;Reality limits everybody's choices. However, further limitation of a pregnant woman's choices by making abortion illegal goes in the complete opposite direction of free choice. The pro-choice movement and politicians who are pro-choice are the ones advocating for the social programs that will make free choice more of a reality.

Oh come on. Do you really believe actions are justified just because they are choices? I doubt you think you should have the right to run me over with a truck because it is a choice. We all believe there are choices, but at the same time, we believe that there are good and bad choices. But since you don't consider it a right as a choice to run me over- why the double standard? 

&gt;I think you're misunderstanding me. It can be a responsible choice for some women. No one has a responsibility to get an abortion they don't want. Again, that's the opposite of choice.

Responsible: being the primary cause of something and so able to be blamed or credited for it.

Abortion just allows you a ticket out of taking responsibility for your actions. And again, choices aren't justified just because they are choices.

&gt;Wow. Have you done any research into why women want abortions? I think it might give you more compassion for the desperation that drives abortion most of the time. And I will again make the point that there are alternatives to parenting, not so to pregnancy.

I have, but I don't see how that defeats my argument. Abortion kills a human being. Therefore, abortion is wrong. 

If you believed that murder/rape/theft/vandalism should be illegal, would you budge on this stance if it negatively implicated the murderer/rapist/etc in some way? No, you'd hold to your stance that murder/rape/theft/vandalism is immoral and say to hell with whatever (unfortunately negative) consequences come along with it.

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/5gk68x/reasons_for_abortion_by_state/) is some recent data on abortion reasons, though it limited to a few states. But you get the idea.

&gt;Then you're a misogynist, full stop.

Ohhhhh no... wait... this stuff about doctors knowing better then their patients and being prolifers is... misogynistic? I wish someone had told me this ages ago. Yeah, now that you put it that way, I actually get it. I'm done saying doctors know better than their patients. I'm done being prolife. Pack your bags, /u/socialworker80, we can be pro-choice now because our views are **misogynistic and stupid**!

&gt;You can't see a difference between ""this is how to stay healthy during pregnancy"" and ""I know better than you if you should be pregnant at all""? ""Here's how to take care of your body"" vs ""here's how I demand you use your body against your will because I know better than you do""? This is highly problematic and deserves some thought on your part, please.

No, I can't see the difference between telling a pregnant woman how to take care of herself and telling her how to take care of the human she created. I'd like to know how telling someone that they can't kill someone else is a violation of their rights. I'm not asking this to be a cunt, I'm asking it because I'm genuinely curious and have yet to hear a good defense. If you really believe that a woman’s body is autonomous, then you must defend a mother who does things that could seriously harm her unborn child, even if she hasn’t chosen to abort it. 

&gt;But it is granted. The woman is free to choose how she uses her body. The doctor doesn't tell her what to do, just helps her do what she chooses, safely. Like with your prenatal care example. The doctor didn't decide whether your mother should use her uterus to gestate you, s/he just told her the best way to go about it.

But psych ward and suicidal patients don't have the autonomy to do what they want. You didn't answer that one. Continuing on, that is because the doctor has the child and the mother's best interests in mind. Though it is true that probably save for a few prolifers out there, if my mother had disregarded the doctor's orders and I had died or been born with health defects, people wouldn't care or agree that I should have been aborted to save me from suffering. See above.

&gt;home remedies are generally not as safe as real medicine... she can get an infection, bleed out, be unsuccessful with the abortion, etc... it's a surgery....

surgery was invented to save lives, not take them. Your argument is invalid. If a woman is so desperate to kill her child that she attempts to murder it with a coat hanger, she is probably suffering from a mental illness, not just pregnancy.

You said, 

&gt;....the case of pregnancy, the fetus is the one violating its mother's bodily autonomy. Do you think a woman should have to tolerate a rapist and not fight back to avoid violating the rapist's autonomy? 

1/ That's where I got the idea that you were bringing rape into this conversation. 

2/ Maybe you will find this an [interesting read](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/index.html). Having your rights forcefully taken from you is not the same as becoming pregnant as a result of actions you chose to take. The child did not force itself upon the mother. The child did not invade the mother. At no point in time did the child forcefully enter the mother's body. It was conceived there, so it cannot be said to have come from the outside and invaded the mother. The same cannot be said for a rapist or slave owner. Perhaps it would serve you well to see a graphic description of rape in comparison to pregnancy. 

3/ i do not underestimate the pain of pregnancy when I say that the two have vast differences. I understand that it is painful, but that doesn't prove it is at all similar to rape. It is true that as a virgin, I have never been pregnant, so I cannot fully understand what it means to go through the physically tasking jobs to watch for my child's health as well as my own, but I have watched my mother go through pregnancy six times, and through a second point of view, it doesn't look like a life-threatening disease to carry a pregnancy to term, and nowhere near as traumatizing as being raped would be. Honestly, the way some people talk about pregnancy, you'd think it was a disease like STDs or strep throat or cancer.

You argument is like saying that because so many people die in car wrecks then that makes it OK for me to intentionally kill people using my car. We're not talking about the same thing. Let's say that it's true that natural conception and abortion are equivalent in terms of the suffering they cause. That does not justify abortion nor does it establish that natural conception is immoral.

I have no idea what you're trying to argue here.  I didn't mention suffering and I never claimed conception is immoral, just that it is not the most likely outcome of a sexual encounter.

&gt; if a person knows they are risking the occurrence of that event, and they freely choose to act and take those risks, they are responsible for the result.

Are you consistent with that belief?  Do you withhold medical care for people who take risks by not wearing seat belts, eating unpasteurized cheese, not getting vaccinated, etc?  Besides pregnancy, when do you think it's appropriate to impinge on what someone is allowed to do with their body because of previous decisions about how to use it?

&gt; That would be like dragging a person into my house and killing the person, even though it was my actions that caused the person to be there.

If I dragged someone to my house and they refused to leave when I asked them to, I would have a right to defend myself, certainly.  There's no ""lesser force"" when it comes to abortion.  I could ask a visitor to leave.  There's no way to politely ask a fetus to evacuate your uterus.

&gt;You are still forcing the mother to use her body for a short amount of time until she can give the child in question to a third party. Inconsistency.

The time it takes to secure a child with a responsible adult is not in any way comparable to 9 months of pregnancy plus giving birth.  It's not completely black and white.

&gt;So until such a time when we have artificial wombs, we, as a society, simply must kill our youngest children? There is no other choice for us? 

What?  You realize I'm pro-CHOICE?  

&gt;We can't support mothers and fathers so that raising children is easier? We can't make adoption easier and less stigmatized and traumatic by increasing awareness and making open adoptions more common? We are so helpless to do any of these thing that we must kill?

Again, what?

&gt;I am suggesting that a pregnant woman who wants to kill her offspring as a result of her own actions leading to the conception of her offspring is mentally ill, yes. Would you not say the same to a woman who wants to kill her born offspring?

Wow.  Have you done any research into why women want abortions?  I think it might give you more compassion for the desperation that drives abortion most of the time.  And I will again make the point that there are alternatives to parenting, not so to pregnancy.

&gt;&gt;Do you think women are in some way ignorant about pregnancy or childbirth and should be disqualified from deciding about their own abortions?

&gt;Yes, that is what I am saying. 

Then you are a misogynist, full stop.

&gt;My mother had a doctor to give her prenatal care instructions because even though she had been pregnant before, she did not have the proper knowledge and care for her pregnancy. I do not see how a pregnant woman who wants to abort her child is any different.

""Here's how to take care of your body"" vs ""here's how I demand you use your body against your will because I know better than you do""?  This is highly problematic and deserves some thought on your part, please.


&gt;My point was bodily autonomy is not fully granted in those situations because it could cause harm. 

But it is granted.  The woman is free to choose how she uses her body.  The doctor doesn't tell her what to do, just helps her do what she chooses, safely.  Like with your prenatal care example.  The doctor didn't decide whether your mother should use her uterus to gestate you, s/he just told her the best way to go about it.  

&gt;why do you think abortion is overseen by a doctor? I thought the whole prochoice argument for illegalising abortion was because women would be having abortions in back alleys and such.

Yes, the pro-choice argument for keeping abortion legal and easily accessible is that when women are desperate they find ways to abort.  Home remedies are generally not as safe as real medicine.  Doctors have knowledge and training.  For example, if a woman sticks a coat hanger in her vagina to try to give herself an abortion, she can get an infection, bleed out, be unsuccessful with the abortion, etc.  If a doctor does it, s/he has the training to keep a sterile field, knows the anatomy to not do any damage to the cervix or hit a large blood vessel, etc.  It's a surgery...

I don't understand where this rape victim or life of the mother comes up.  It's a tangent that I'm going to avoid for now.  Suffice it to say I think any pregnant woman who wants an abortion should get one, easily and legally. 

&gt;On pregnancy/bodily autonomy violation and rape: I would say that is quite different from being quite literally forced to have unwilling sex and undergo a painful bodily invasion from the outside. 

In rape, the rapist accesses the body of their victim and uses it without their consent.  In unwanted pregnancy, the fetus accesses the body of the mother and uses it without her consent.  Pregnancy can be painful and childbirth most certainly is.  It is a different violation, rape vs forced pregnancy and childbirth, but that doesn't mean they're not both awful violations of a person's bodily autonomy.

&gt;You are devaluing rape victims' experience when you compare pregnancy that was a result of reckless yet willing sexual actions to rape.

I disagree.  I think you are devaluing pregnant women's experience (here and all throughout your comment).  I am not minimizing the anguish that is rape.  I am saying that forcing a person to use their body in ways they don't consent to is wrong, regardless of the other trappings of the violation.",2,1495604848,2017-05-24 01:47:28

Let's say that it's true that natural conception and abortion are equivalent in terms of the suffering they cause. That does not justify abortion nor does it establish that natural conception is immoral.

I would argue that it certainly is the natural way, as humans(and our less evolved counterparts) have been having sex for millennia, even more, and if it were not the natural way we would not be there. But - even if you do not accept that sex naturally leads to conception, what matters is foreknowledge. So whether an event is normal or not, if a person knows they are risking the occurrence of that event, and they freely choose to act and take those risks, they are responsible for the result. End of story. 

&gt;If I say ""Sorry fetus, you don't have my consent to inhabit my uterus"" how is that not my body that I'm in charge of? Why does the existence of that fetus mean I can no longer choose who has access to my body?

Because you made the choice that resulted in the fetus's conception, and it is the fetus you are killing in order to maintain ""bodily autonomy"". That would be like dragging a person into my house and killing the person, even though it was my actions that caused the person to be there.

&gt;I have a baby. If I no longer wanted to be responsible for her, I could give her to a multitude of other people. I can delegate my parental responsibility or sign away my rights and let someone else have them. Many other adults in her life could keep her safe, healthy, fed, etc. How do you suggest that a pregnant woman does that? There is no way for her to keep the fetus alive except by allowing it to live in and consume her body. It is not ethical or legal to force this violation on her without her consent.

You are still forcing the mother to use her body for a short amount of time until she can give the child in question to a third party. Inconsistency.

So until such a time when we have artificial wombs, we, as a society, simply must kill our youngest children? There is no other choice for us? We can't support mothers and fathers so that raising children is easier? We can't make adoption easier and less stigmatized and traumatic by increasing awareness and making open adoptions more common? We are so helpless to do any of these thing that we must kill? 

&gt;While this may be your opinion, you do not get to make that decision for anyone but yourself (thank god).

I could say the same thing to you about abortion being a responsibility. You did not provide anything to prove me wrong.

&gt;Sure, there are times when people are mentally ill and aren't capable of making healthy decisions. Are you suggesting that being a pregnant woman = a mental illness?

I am suggesting that a pregnant woman who wants to kill her offspring as a result of her own actions leading to the conception of her offspring is mentally ill, yes. Would you not say the same to a woman who wants to kill her born offspring?

&gt;Two things- it's also about education. A non-doctor doesn't have the education they need to safely decide what medicine they should have. Do you think women are in some way ignorant about pregnancy or childbirth and should be disqualified from deciding about their own abortions?

Yes, that is what I am saying. My mother had a doctor to give her prenatal care instructions because even though she had been pregnant before, she did not have the proper knowledge and care for her pregnancy. I do not see how a pregnant woman who wants to abort her child is any different.

&gt;Secondly, a woman doesn't get a legal abortion without the help of a doctor. As I said, I trust women to make this decision with their doctors. It's a medical procedure, it's reasonable to have doctors involved. So your ""patients talk to doctors to access medicine"" point is null- so do pregnant women.

Sorry, my statement was not very well written. Just an analogy. My point was bodily autonomy is not fully granted in those situations because it could cause harm. And although I disagree with abortion, assisted via abortionist or not, why do you think abortion is overseen by a doctor? I thought the whole prochoice argument for illegalising abortion was because women would be having abortions in back alleys and such.


&gt;In the case of pregnancy, the fetus is the one violating its mother's bodily autonomy. Do you think a woman should have to tolerate a rapist and not fight back to avoid violating the rapist's autonomy? Abortion is a reaction to a violation. If a fetus could live outside of its mother, I would not argue that she had a right to kill it just because it's her fetus.

One of the reasons a fetus is not classified as a parasite is because it never at any point in time came from the outside and invaded the mother; it was concieved inside her body, (99% of the time as a result of her own choice.) TBH the rape situation makes such a small percentage of abortions it has become a strawman to avert the usual argument(is abortion immoral). How does this argument affect the morality of abortion?

I believe an exception should be made for life of the mother. That being said, the life of the mother makes up such a small percentage it is not worth talking about in the grand lense of abortion.

You may be wondering why I don't advocate the same for rape victims, well my answer is that the child concieved is not at fault for the crime, and rape victims report increased trauma after abortions,see [here](http://afterabortion.org/2012/abortion-doesnt-help-rape-victims-say-women-whove-been-there/) and [here](http://www.abortionfacts.com/reardon/rape-incest-and-abortion-searching-beyond-the-myths). I believe there should be more support available for rape victims of both genders, but killing an innocent child does not solve anything.

On pregnancy/bodily autonomy violation and rape: I would say that is quite different from being quite literally forced to have unwilling sex and undergo a painful bodily invasion from the outside. You are devaluing rape victims' experience when you compare pregnancy that was a result of reckless yet willing sexual actions to rape./u/socialworker80 has been a victim of rape and is a family molestation survivor. Maybe you should tell her how not being allowed to have an abortion is akin to how she was sexually violated.


&gt;If your point is to look foolish, then sure.

The stats about women who see adoption as immoral are new to me!  I'm glad to have them in my ""pro-choice arsenal.""  

You touch on this briefly, but do you know of any studies about the long term effects of adoption?  Both on the birth mothers and on the children.  It seems like a very solid argument that abortion is unlikely to cause any long term trauma (I've seen the studies), whereas adoption does (sources?).  I totally believe it and would love to have a study to read about that piece of that argument.",1,1495596021,2017-05-23 23:20:21
76,"Wow, our discussion had been very civil.  I'm shocked by the change in your tone.

&gt;car accidents aren't comparable because crashing a car is not the natural result of driving: getting from point A to point B is. In the same way getting from point A to point B is the natural result of driving a car, conceiving a child is the natural result of pregnancy. Contracting an STD is more comparable to a car accident then pregnancy, IMO.

Appeal to nature, eh?  Even if I were to agree that pregnancy is the natural result of sex, so what?  Why is a ""natural result"" better than an ""unnatural result""?  The natural result of the plague is death.  Should we withhold antibiotics to people who get infected?  I doubt you'd find many people who'd say yes.

Setting that aside, I disagree that pregnancy is the natural result of sex.  Most sex does not result in pregnancy.  [Here's](http://www.self.com/story/how-often-happy-couples-have-sex) a source that says the average couple has sex once a week.  A woman is only fertile for 48 hours of her cycle, so at most, 1 in 4 sex acts happen when the woman is fertile.  It's possible that they miss the window all together!  Let's say, though, that in this case they do.  [Only 50% of fertilized eggs implant!](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/conception_how_it_works/).  So now we're down to 1 in 8 sexual interactions between a couple that actually results in pregnancy.  

That is, a heterosexual couple.  Which eliminates about 4% of the population.  A fertile, hetero couple.  [12% of couples have fertility issues](http://www.resolve.org/get-involved/the-center-for-infertility-justice/blog/how-many-people-have-infertility.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/).  And let's not forget about age.  Of people over 18, [only 48% are below 45](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf).  So the majority of people having sex are infertile due to gender, biology, or age.  The fertile ones having sex only get pregnant at most 12.5% of the times they have sex.  And of course once pregnant there's nine months of sex that doesn't result in more pregnancy.  

So, no, pregnancy is not the natural outcome of having sex, or even really all that likely for any given sexual encounter, even in the absence of contraception.  

&gt;A being has already been created due to your actions; and you can no longer withdraw your consent because it is no longer YOUR BODY you are withdrawing consent on

If I say ""Sorry fetus, you don't have my consent to inhabit my uterus"" how is that not my body that I'm in charge of?  Why does the existence of that fetus mean I can no longer choose who has access to my body?

&gt;when two people consent to sex, they are agreeing/ consenting that it may result in the creation of another being

Agreed.  However, no one is consenting to allow that being to live inside of them for as long as it needs.  Yes, if a person chooses to have sex and gets pregnant, they are responsible for dealing with the result.  Such as, by having an abortion.  

&gt;I'd like to see you use this logic when it's your child living in their parents home. I'm pretty sure if you throw them out and they died you would be charged. It's called parental responsibility laws.

I have a baby.  If I no longer wanted to be responsible for her, I could give her to a multitude of other people.  I can delegate my parental responsibility or sign away my rights and let someone else have them.  Many other adults in her life could keep her safe, healthy, fed, etc.  How do you suggest that a pregnant woman does that?  There is no way for her to keep the fetus alive except by allowing it to live in and consume her body.  It is not ethical or legal to force this violation on her without her consent. 

&gt;in this case, being responsible means not killing a human being to relinquish that responsibility.

While this may be your opinion, you do not get to make that decision for anyone but yourself (thank god).  

&gt;There are suicide watches and psych wards because we don't consider individuals suffering from suicidal or psychotic thoughts/behaviour to be capable of making such a life-changing decision. 

Sure, there are times when people are mentally ill and aren't capable of making healthy decisions.  Are you suggesting that being a pregnant woman = a mental illness?  


&gt;Drug prescriptions exist because patients are not fully capable of choosing whatever medicine they wish to take simply because they have bodily autonomy; they need a doctor's consent and a prescription so that they don't accidentally kill themselves.

78,"A wild /u/justcurious12345 appeared. S/he tried ""ridicule the argument until it goes away."" It is not very effective.

1/ car accidents aren't comparable because crashing a car is not the natural result of driving: getting from point A to point B is. In the same way getting from point A to point B is the natural result of driving a car, conceiving a child is the natural result of pregnancy. Contracting an STD is more comparable to a car accident then pregnancy, IMO.

2/  your second paragraph about consent being withdrawn during pregnancy makes no sense. A being has already been created due to your actions; and you can no longer withdraw your consent because it is no longer YOUR BODY you are withdrawing consent on- you are simply quoting some stuff the pro-choice agenda tells you to boost your own ideas. 

3/ On consent and sex - when two people consent to sex, they are agreeing/ consenting that it may result in the creation of another being - and not just another being, one that is fully bodily dependent upon them. When a person chooses to act a certain way knowing a risk(and I hate using the word risk because as I stated previously, pregnancy is just the natural end of sex regardless of the intention)may fall through, they are responsible for the result.  And being responsible for the result matters a lot in this context. 

4/ I'd like to see you use this logic when it's your child living in their parents home. I'm pretty sure if you throw them out and they died you would be charged. It's called parental responsibility laws.

5/ And in this case, being responsible means not killing a human being to relinquish that responsibility. Abortion is used as a ticket out of responsibility; 98% of abortions are due to convenience and not rape or life of the mother. That's not taking responsibility for your actions; it's hiding from responsibility.

&gt;But as a society we usually agree that individuals are generally better at making their own decisions than the state is. I see no reason why we should second guess pregnant women's ability to adult any more than any other group.

We don't always take individuals' decisions to be the best. There are suicide watches and psych wards because we don't consider individuals suffering from suicidal or psychotic thoughts/behaviour to be capable of making such a life-changing decision. Drug prescriptions exist because patients are not fully capable of choosing whatever medicine they wish to take simply because they have bodily autonomy; they need a doctor's consent and a prescription so that they don't accidentally kill themselves. We have anti-rape laws because we don't believe a rapist should have the bodily autonomy to infringe upon another's body just because the rapist has bodily autonomy. We put limits on bodily autonomy sometimes because they infringe upon another person's bodily autonomy.

I could go on about this, but I think I've made my point.

106,"Religious influence was ""significantly at play"" in the case of a pregnant asylum seeker who was denied an abortion in Ireland even though she was suicidal, her solicitor has claimed. Medical records suggest that the woman known as Ms Y was questioned while in hospital about her religious beliefs and asked whether her baby ""deserved a life"" as doctors considered whether to terminate her pregnancy. Caoimhe Haughey, Ms Y's solicitor, claimed that, in her opinion, this amounted to religious influence.


""There is no doubt in my mind that religious influences and interference were significantly at play, given the fact that my client had her own religious belief, given the fact that her own religious belief was mentioned to her in a way that, in my opinion, was done with a view to make her feel guilty and ashamed,"" she said.
""She was told that the baby only needed her until it was born. And what is clear to me is that they were delaying carrying out any procedure on my client, notwithstanding promises to the contrary, in order to improve the viability situation for the baby.""


The Health Service Executive (HSE) said it had no knowledge of the allegations and it appeared they had not been raised previously. A HSE review of the case was abandoned following a legal challenge by Ms Y. It is understood that an independent review of the legal approach taken in the case has been completed.
Ms Haughey made a submission on Ms Y's case to the Citizens' Assembly, which last weekend recommended allowing abortion in a range of circumstances. Her case provoked national debate on Ireland's new abortion laws when it became public in 2014. The young woman discovered she was pregnant weeks after arriving in Ireland in March of that year. She said she had been raped in her home country and sought an abortion. She was alone and spoke no English and attempted suicide.


Despite interaction with various agencies, she was 22 weeks' pregnant when she was referred for assessment for a termination on grounds of suicide. She repeatedly requested an abortion but was ultimately told her pregnancy was too advanced. Her baby was delivered prematurely by caesarean and is in State care. The case highlighted the legal anomaly doctors faced in balancing the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act with the constitutional requirement of protecting the life of the unborn where ""practicable"".
Contemporaneous medical records noted how doctors ""hoped to maintain the patient on the ward"" until the foetus was viable. Another record said: ""We will have to make her an involuntary patient and keep her against her will.""


A clinical decision had been made to remove the baby by caesarean when lawyers became involved, the records show. The medical records disclose that Ms Y was asked if she wanted to see a priest, which she declined. On another occasion, she was asked: ""Do you think the baby deserves a life?"" The notes also record how she was told by a doctor that the ""abortion would not take the rape away"". Ms Y continues to suffer trauma as a result of her experiences around the birth of her baby, according to her statement of claim.


She has suffered ""very significant and permanent psychiatric injuries"" as a result of being ""denied a termination"" and ""coerced into prolonging her pregnancy"". She has ""continuing dreams about her baby which cause her to wake up"". The woman is suing the Health Service Executive and 10 other agencies on several grounds, including alleged negligence, breach of duty and false imprisonment.


Ms Haughey said she made a submission on her client's case to the Citizens' Assembly because she believes the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act ""does not work"".


""It is not workable to put a subjective decision into the hands of three individuals, two psychiatrists and one obstetrician who differ from case to case,"" she said. ""It is an impossible position to put doctors in.""",3,1495454209,2017-05-22 07:56:49

108,I feel like you misunderstood ,2,1495400314,2017-05-21 16:58:34
109,"Personally, I point out to those people that getting an abortion is the way I would take responsibility for an accidental pregnancy. Is it really more responsible to keep a baby you never wanted? One you probably can't afford? Or is it more responsible to pawn it off on someone else? I say it's best to just not bring it into the world at all. 

I usually also point out that consent to sex is not consent to having a child or going through a pregnancy. And that even if I consented to pregnancy I can revoke that consent. ",9,1495399085,2017-05-21 16:38:05
110,"I don't care what kind of adoption you're talking about, it is NOT a viable alternative to abortion. 

Adoption is a very important option for women to have, but abortion needs to be offered alongside it. Abortion stops the pregnancy and having a baby to care for. Adoption only stops having a baby to care for. They're two totally different things. You need both. ",5,1495398565,2017-05-21 16:29:25
111,"I have a few responses.  First of all, lots of sex happens without a resulting pregnancy.  Lots of people have sex for pleasure.  So I don't buy it that sex should equal baby as a natural consequence.

Secondly, let's talk about consent.  Consent is not transferable.  If I consent to sex, I am not necessarily consenting to an entire pregnancy.  I am consenting to the risk of pregnancy (and hopefully if I don't want to get pregnant, doing what I can to avoid that).  But I have a solution if I do get pregnant that is not giving birth.  

So, for example, let's say I consent to drive a car.  I am consenting to the risk of getting injured in a car accident.  Very few people would argue that if I did get in an accident I shouldn't be allowed to access healthcare for it.  Yes, I consented to the risk, but that doesn't mean I need to suffer needlessly.  This is true even if I opted not to wear my seat belt or drive drunk or any other scenario wherein the risk was higher that I might be injured.  Consent to one activity (sex, car driving) is not consent to another activity (pregnancy to term, suffering from injuries) even if the first activity has the second as a known risk.

Third, consent can be withdrawn.  Even if I intended to get pregnant, circumstances might have changed such that I no longer consent to having that fetus inside of me.  For example, I lost my job, I lost my partner, my partner turned abusive, I found out the fetus has conditions incompatible with life, etc etc.  So even if I initially choose to become pregnant, my consent at an earlier timepoint does not obligate me to continue an activity.  Sex is a good example of that.  If I consent to sex and then get a leg cramp or decide I'm not in the mood or whatever and withdraw my consent, my partner must stop.  My prior consent does not give them access to my body once my consent has been withdrawn.

It's not about responsibilities, it's about consent.  I don't have a responsibility to any other person to keep them alive with my body without my consent.  It doesn't matter how I'm related to them or if I caused their need for my body, I'm not obligated to them.  If I drove drunk with my kid in the car and got in an accident that caused them to need a blood transfusion, I would not be obligated to donate blood.  They're my child, they are going to die without accessing my body, and it's my fault that they're in that condition, but I am not obligated to give up my body for them.  Legally at least.  Morally, maybe, but the laws protect my bodily autonomy just like they do a pregnant woman's.

Additionally, I'll agree with the other poster that if a woman gets an abortion it's probably the most responsible decision she could be making.  I trust women.  I trust women to compare all their options, assess their particular situation and capabilities, and make a decision (with the help of their doctor) as to what is the safest, most responsible decision for them.  Sure, as with anything, there are people who might fail at that.  But as a society we usually agree that individuals are generally better at making their own decisions than the state is.  I see no reason why we should second guess pregnant women's ability to adult any more than any other group.

Concisely: I don't think that a responsibility exists to give birth to a fetus just because you're its mother , I don't think that consenting to sex is an automatic consent to a full term pregnancy, and I think we should trust pregnant women to be responsible with their choices as much as we do any other group.",12,1495396868,2017-05-21 16:01:08

137,"For me, personally, an anti-abortion person suggesting adoption is always going to seem calculated, because they don't really consider abortion a potentially good option.  As a pro-choicer, I don't think that abortion is the right solution for unwanted pregnancy for everybody, so I view adoption as a possible good alternative when abortion isn't the right fit.  But for someone who believes abortion is evil or morally wrong, who believes that it will 100% be the wrong choice for every single person . . . the suggestion to carry to term and put one's child up for adoption is always going to be a default, rather than measured counseling in regards to a specific situation, you know?

I also see a lot of conflating pregnancy and birth with raising a child; while obviously, an undecided pregnant woman is thinking both of the now and the future, there's a popular saying in the pro-choice community: adoption is the alternative to parenting, not to pregnancy.

There's also a lot of pretending, I think, that adoption is an easy solution, presumably because anti-abortion folks either truly believe (or at least push the idea that) abortion is so painful/traumatic/soul-crushing for a woman that adoption is far better for her emotionally and psychologically.  In reality, we know that abortion has a negligible  effect on mental health, so we can go in comparing the issues with each on an individual basis.  And nobody really knows for sure how a given reproductive decision will affect them- you can go in thinking you'll feel one way and end up feeling differently when it actually happens- but there's a lot of evidence pointing to adoption (especially certain types, like closed adoption) being very difficult for a woman to bear.  And so to for abortion.  The only difference being that the anti-abortion community uses intense pressure, scare tactics, and manipulation in favor of one option.  And in society, women who regret putting their children up for adoption (much like women who regret having children to raise themselves) are an uncomfortable topic that we don't want to address/deal with; their pain often gets swept under the rug (whereas at least women who regret their abortions are readily embraced/co-opted by the anti-abortion movement).

In 2004, Guttmacher administrated [a structured survey](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives) that was completed by 1,209 abortion patients at 11 large providers (with in-depth interviews conducted with 38 women at four sites), and in their findings, they noted: ""While fewer than 1% of women in the quantitative survey volunteered that they would not consider or did not favor having a baby and giving it up for adoption, more than one-third of interview respondents said they had considered adoption and concluded that it was a morally unconscionable option because giving one's child away is wrong.""  Regardless of what we make of that statistic, it's something that can't be ignored.  Ant-abortion folks like to pretend that the decision to abort rather than adopt is one of selfishness/self-centered pragmatism.  In actuality, for a lot of people, they have just as strong feelings about the morality of adoption as other people feel about abortion.

I think that the foster care system argument is a little bit of a pro-choice gotcha! question- basically, using it as a way to shut down any anti-abortion argument that involves lines like ""but so many people would love your baby/so many couples can't conceive so how dare you abort!"".  Basically, it's a rhetorical cudgel to slam over the heads of anybody whose argument is based on scarcity (with an added side of implicit accusation of/judgment for people wanting ""perfect babies"" rather than older children from the foster care system that are seen as less desirable).  I tend not to talk about the foster system much in my discussions regarding abortion.

Overall, the topic is so huge and fascinating.  Really, there's stigma attached, in varying degrees, to whatever option a woman chooses for her unintended pregnancy, and indeed even for being in the situation of unintended pregnancy in the first place.  It'd be wonderful if we could discuss the nuances, but it's hard to do when they're basically obliterated by the other side, which views abortion as unviable and thus not really up for discussion beyond its unacceptability.",14,1495302081,2017-05-20 13:41:21

139,"At the end of the day, if you restrict abortion at any stage of development, you are effectively telling pregnant women that their ""responsibility"" of being a human incubator overrides their rights as individuals. As a result you are stripping away a women's rights to her own body and prioritizing the potential of a fully developed human life over an already existing one.

Most pro-choice people would prefer not to end a potential human life, and abortion is a hard decision for most people. I'm certain most pro-choice people would be in favor of saving the life regardless of the stage of development if medical science were there (allowing the body to develop in an artificial incubator), and assuming the infrastructure existed to care for said lives (adoption for every new born whose parents did not want children). However, just because these things aren't a reality (yet), and abortion is an unsavory topic, doesn't mean women should have to forfeit the rights to their own bodies because of other people's moral hang ups.

158,"You're entitled to your opinion.  It doesn't make it objectively morally verifiable simply because you have latched on to one point in the life cycle and chosen to ignore all of the other biological events that occur.  A long time ago people were saying same sex marriage was immoral because of the ""biological fact"" that two men or women can't produce a baby on their own, and ""it isn't natural,"" and a host of other vague, overly simplified messages cherry picked from whatever they wanted them to be.  They ignored all of the other factors of love, family, oxytocin bonding, and shared assets that make a marriage.  The people who supported marriage equality understood that the issue was far more complex and nuanced than just being a fertile couple.  Abortion and personhood are complex and nuanced, otherwise many of you would not admit that at the very least, there should be exceptions for the life of the mother.  Funny you can never state objectively which percentage risk of death is always acceptable.  It kind of indicates that deep down, you know there are too many gray areas, but you latched on to your perspective and that's that.  Anyway, as far as same sex marriage opponents, it's fairly clear at this point in history they were latching on to one biological event to base their entire moral stance on.  If you want to do that with abortion, you're entitled to your opinion.  However, a biological event or factor, in itself, does not seem to make a sound and complete case for a moral stance that's applicable to all scenarios.

The thing is that for many prolifers a huge part of their argument is that we ought to use the most objective tool we have available to us to draw a line. That is science and more particularly biology. Using any other means to draw a line is arbitrary and subjective. It opens that door to discrimination and can be used at the whimsy of anyone with any ideology.

&gt;And anyway, the fact that you need to empty out an egg cell, meaning it contributes none of its own DNA, means that cloning is not biologically identical to human conception (where egg contributes 50% of DNA).

An identical twin has 100% of it's siblings DNA. This is irrelevant. I believe that the biological criteria that determine a human entity as an individual are that they are a living, human organism with separate dna from it's parents. This applies to clones as well.

""Human beings are much more than our genes"" refers to human beings as men, women, and children, which is the definition I already said operates in this article.  That means it touches on personhood.  If you finish the article, that much becomes clear.  It's about the significance of all of the variable stages in the human life cycle and how distinct fetal stages are, meaning conception is not the definitive, sole morally significant instance that many of you portray.  For example:

Early embryonic forms do not share basic commonalities that define us as human beings. For example, zygotes and blastocysts are barely visible to the naked eye and have no bodies, brains, skeleton, or internal organs. Are they materially substantial enough to count as human beings? Fetuses cannot breath or make sounds, and they cannot see or be seen (except by shadowy ultrasound). They absorb nourishment and expel waste via an umbilical cord and placenta, not via a mouth and anus as do all other human beings. Further, fetuses are not just miniature babies. At various stages, fetuses have eyes on stalks, notochords (instead of spines), fish-like gills, tails, downy fur, distorted torsos, spindly legs, giant heads, and alien-looking faces. In fact, an early human fetus is practically indistinguishable in appearance from a dog or pig fetus. Finally, the fetal brain is not yet capable of conscious thought and memory (which aren't fully actualized until two or three years after birth). But our complex brains are what set us apart from animals and define us as human beings. The brain is the seat of personhood[15].

&gt; Biologically a clone is a human being. The cell from your dandruff still needs to be combined with the an egg. See here.

I never said a clone wasn't a human being.  I suggested that early stage organisms don't deserve legally protected personhood in the same manner that human beings deserve it, meaning I believe in keeping abortion legal.  I suggested that conception is not the defining moral instance in matters of reproductive choice and I already elaborated on that.  

And anyway, the fact that you need to empty out an egg cell, meaning it contributes none of its own DNA, means that cloning is not biologically identical to human conception (where egg contributes 50% of DNA).  So I'm not sure what you were getting at with your own article.

Me neither! The thing is, no one does. There is no single point at which the fetus comes alive. Eggs and sperm are already live cells so there is no point in which ""life begins"". Anyone who says there is is just giving their opinion. You could say that a fetus comes alive once it is sentient but that is a little after week 20 and no one has an abortion that late just because they don't feel like being pregnant. 

&gt;My logic on the matter is this: Pro-life vs. Pro-choice is a give and take.

YES! I completely agree with this. I don't think abortion is ever really a good thing because its an incredibly emotional choice and an invasive medical procedure. I want to make changes so that the amount of women seeking abortions continues to lower. The way I see that happening is helping women avoid pregnancy in the first place and also making it possible for them to get assistance in raising their potential child. Anyone who opposes measures to help but wants to block abortion just wants to punish people. 

&gt; It's not my business what other people, particularly women, do with their bodies and, frankly, I don't care. Along with that, to me it makes sense that birth control is a lot more cost efficient than paying for the raising and care of a child for up to 18 years.

There's a difference between the abortion criminalization movement and pro lifers. Some people just don't want you to have to get an abortion, because it means somethings wrong. 

I definitely don't think that article invalidates the view that they think it's murder. Also, just because they want to punish women for sex, doesn't also cant believe mean it's murder and they can also want to punish everyone for having premarital sex, not just women.

216,"The following link is a fairly accurate depiction of my feelings on the matter, minus a few different ways I'd phrase things.  For the purposes of this article, 'human being' is a ""man woman and child"" (English Oxford living dictionaries).  I'm not going to write a novel in my own words at this point.  The explanation from prochoice action network is long enough.  

Basically, I don't cherry pick one biological instance (like conception) out of an extremely personal, medically variable, and rapidly changing situation.  Ultimately, biological instances aside, people disagree on when and how the laws should change.  You and I could agree that life started at conception, but that would not be enough to get us to where we could agree on laws about abortion because the mother's life and health would still be a huge factor, and while that may not bother someone else, it bothers me.  The mother is a living human being, actually does have full personhood, and has an established life.  So ultimately the disagreement doesn't come down to life of the blastocyst starting at conception.  It comes down to who and what has control over that life and at what stages, and why.  The why is pretty big to me (especially if it comes down to matters of rape, incest, domestic violence, fetal anomalies and potential disabilities, financial disaster, health conditions like preeclampsia, etc.).  I think it's ridiculous to try and infer moral laws that apply to a wide variety of situations just because one biological event has occurred.  I think the concept of the typical abortion ""done out of convenience"" is narrow-minded and inaccurate because each situation is so unique.  

I didn't get this way overnight.  I spent time with women who fight for our reproductive rights and met women who can't take hormonal birth control pills due to medical conditions, women who couldn't afford birth control because they didn't have health insurance, women who had no sex education, women whose parents kicked them out for who they loved, women who have irregular periods, body shame, obesity, HIV, diabetes, mental health issues, autoimmune disorders, and many other situations that may make them not want to have a baby ""at this time.""  I still think those women deserve to have sex for pleasure, and I think they deserve an abortion if they want one, especially since most abortions stop life so early in the life cycle that most of what's at stake is just potential (no pain is felt, no one loses a loved one that they've spent years with, no one is conscious of what they had, missed, or could have had in more than an abstract manner).  

But you have to consider all of these things together.  You can't just cherry pick one part of these scenarios.  Ethics are never like that.  Ethics demand a full analysis of the context and if there are generalizable factors, they certainly involve more than just ""life starts at conception.""

237,"Thank you for sharing. I came here to look over the subreddit and was surprised to find there actually is one (there really is a subreddit for everything). I have a friend whose break down of pro-life vs pro-choice comes down to whether or not one believes life begins at conception. I don't really share that view because I fully admit that I don't know -when- life really begins.

My logic on the matter is this:
Pro-life vs. Pro-choice is a give and take. If I support the defunding of organizations like Planned Parenthood and other places that provide not only abortions, but other means of birth control so that abortion doesn't necessarily have to be an option, then I feel that I (and everyone else who supports it) must agree to provide funding and assistance to people who have children they can't afford to provide for. That includes doctor and hospital bills, healthcare, etc. until the child becomes a legal adult, if that is necessary. And I know defunding Planned Parenthood, etc. isn't necessarily the view of the entire Pro-Life movement, just I know that's a particular volatile issue at this time.

If I support the Pro-Choice mindset, then I have to accept that people must have access to birth control and abortions. It has to be one or the other, I CAN'T say ""I don't want my tax dollars to provide birth control, and I don't want my taxes to support the welfare of people who are having kids they can't afford!"" because I've effectively decided to remove their choice, so they can't make that decision legally.

Now how I ultimately came to the conclusion of what side of the proverbial fence I'm on, I took these two ideas and weighed them against each other. That's not to say I didn't apply my own personal ethical beliefs on the matter, which pretty much boils down to this: It's not my business what other people, particularly women, do with their bodies and, frankly, I don't care. Along with that, to me it makes sense that birth control is a lot more cost efficient than paying for the raising and care of a child for up to 18 years.

Bear in mind, even if you consider the fetus a person from viability, there are still good reasons to permit abortion after this point.

Also, statistics indicate that women *almost never* seek third trimester abortion except in cases of severe feral abnormality or serious risk to the life or health of the mother.

272,"That's why pro lifers can't get around having to make a case for personhood, as much as they'd like to.  If the scientific definition of life is all it takes, then you need to start protecting sperm cells, and probably other types of cells.  Your body's cells can be cloned into a separate human being, scientific advancements allowing.  When are your body's cells deserving of their own personhood?  You can see where the ""living being"" argument is rather weak on its own.  And even if you can consistently demonstrate personhood at a set point in the life cycle (for example viability outside the womb), you still have to contend with the inherent risks involved in birth, the fact that it is more dangerous to the mother's life than legal abortion (as per CDC), and that birth is unpredictable even in pregnancies that are medically classified as low risk.  So, the personhood of the fetus still has a greater impact, potentially, on the personhood of the mother, than most other people do (including a newborn, since newborns don't require a woman to risk her life during birth, as they've already been born).

I asked you if Justice Blackmun's argument suffered from these defects, and you never answered the question.  You response never addressed consistency, logic, strategic moving of goalposts, or result-driven decision making to ensure that ""person"" excludes preborn children.

Of course you can.  If a governing document, like the US Constitution, uses the term ""person,"" then its meaning can be distilled by the judicial process.  Deciding what terms mean is what courts do - every single day.

The question the Court had to decide in Roe v. Wade, therefore, was whether unborn humans were ""persons.""

In deciding that the term ""person"" excluded the unborn, Justice Blackmun (who authored the opinion) went directly to the Constitution and examined each instance where the term ""person"" was used (there's about 20 of them) and he concluded that in nearly all instances, the use of the word person was such that it only had an application ""postnatally.""

He also noted that when asked for legal authority holding that a fetus is a person under the Fourteenth Amendment, the attorney on the prolife side couldn't cite a single judicial opinion. The significance of this can't be overstated; this means that since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, there had never been any legal dispute in a published court opinion that questioned whether a fetus qualifies as a person. In other words, American civilization had long accepted the notion that ""persons"" do not include fetuses — without question.

He also noted that through the major portion of the 19th century, prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they were in 1972.

326,"I agree, but I'd just like to point out something that many others many not realize.  Biblical pro-life arguments are very weak.  The Bible consistently defines human life as beginning with first breath (God breathes life into Adam in Genesis 2:7, into people in Isaiah 42:5).  While God knew Jeremiah before he was formed in the womb, this only specifically applies to Jeremiah.  Exodus 21 describes a scenario in which striking a pregnant mother which results in miscarriage is ONLY punishable with a fine (vs. eye for eye and tooth for tooth for more serious injuries), which places a LOWER value on the life of the fetus than the life of the mother, and that scenario assumes the fetus was wanted.  Numbers 5 describes the scenario of a priest carrying out an abortion using a toxic solution to be consumed by the mother if the husband suspects the child isn't his.  There are also descriptions that discuss the quality of life after you're born, and some of those suggest that an untimely birth is preferable to a miserable or wicked life.  I could go on.  Anyway, the Bible doesn't say a fetus has no value at all, but it repeatedly implies that the value is less than the value of the pregnant woman and of babies, children, and adults.  There just isn't a strong Biblical case for pro-life arguments to the extent that anti-abortion laws are warranted.  I wish this was more commonly discussed, because the pro-life movement can't get around having to demonstrate legal personhood.  It's either that or moral absolutism, which never works, even for things that we all agree are crimes.  For example, murder is acceptable if it's full and legitimate self-defense, and then it isn't called murder &amp; no one is so stupid as to try to claim ""MURDER IS WRONG"" and wave signs saying that in front of all of the houses of the attorneys for people who were defending their lives.  However, that is the equivalent of what some pro-lifers do.  Their arguments never seem to allow for all of the gray areas.  They always rely on shitty analogies that don't translate to the situation of a pregnant woman.  And then they try to fall back on a faith that doesn't even support what they want to do.  It's such a tragic, preventable, and destructive misuse of faith. ",3,1494100129,2017-05-06 15:48:49

328,"&gt; do you want us to agree that abortion is immoral and that we should all feel shame for supporting a woman's right to choose? Or that we should start shaming women who have abortions? Are you here to shame people who have had abortions?

Shame is mostly a useless feeling. If 'shame' doesn't make someone stop doing something wrong, then why have it? It's only useful if you recognize that something you've done wrong is wrong and stop doing it.
I'm here to debate the morality of abortion and see what kind of arguments there are because the arguments I've heard in real life and in YT videos are very weak. I stated so on the OP.
Also, morality for me, again, is not about shame, it's about doing the right thing. For example in times of slavery, the debate wouldn't be to shame slavers, but in order to see the morality of actions and if there were a slaver, shaming him wouldn't be really useful unless it leads to him stop enslaving or trading with people.

&gt; my example of sloth to rape is...interesting?

It's a logical step from what you stated and what you implied. You stated/implied that the morality of something is not important:

&gt; who cares if it's immoral or not?

And:

&gt; Some people think sloth is immoral, but I think it's a pretty enjoyable way to spend a weekend. And someone else thinking it's immoral isn't going to change my mind or behavior. Or make me feel shame.

Strongly implies that it's shame or pleasure that are your personal considerations on morality. The logical conclusion is that you don't care about morality only about whether it feels good or feels bad(shame). That is if you felt good doing something immoral without feeling shame then you wouldn't care if it's immoral or not, based on your words.

&gt; outcome you are looking for (determination of abortion as moral or immoral) has no purpose other than to place a value judgment on someone else's decision.

I'm not here being mean just looking for excuses to yell and shame people. I'm here to have an interesting debate, see new opinions and ideas, to polish my arguing skills and to see if there's value in abortion that I hadn't considered before. If that leads me to conclude that abortion is heavily immoral, then of course there's a judgement on the action(although the person). I don't even judge murderers, rapists, thieves, etc.., although I do judge the actions as moral/immoral and act accordingly, which is actually what everyone else does. Not judging actions is impossible and if it were possible it would be idiotic not to. I don't value passing judgement in the other people, so it doesn't go around where you seem to think it's going or how my motivations are.",1,1494020674,2017-05-05 17:44:34
329,"Firstly, I didn't claim to be making a grand argument. When I make a grand argument, you'll know it.

Second, your response leads me to question (again) your motive for starting this debate in the first place: do you want us to agree that abortion is immoral and that we should all feel shame for supporting a woman's right to choose? Or that we should start shaming women who have abortions?  Are you here to shame people who have had abortions?

Luckily, I've never had the urge to rape someone, and you going from my example of sloth to rape is...interesting? I can't even watch MMA because I find it too violent, in case you need an example of the level of violence at which I feel uneasy, which is irrelevant to this debate. (And I'm pretty sure it's not). Also, other barriers to me being a rapist are that it's illegal, and I'm too much of a diva to go to jail; and I would have safety and hygiene concerns.

By looking at some of the comments,  it seems that you are male, so we can probably assume that you will never personally have to choose to terminate a pregnancy. So this debate serves no purpose to help you make that decision. So unless you are a physician, thinking about whether or not you will be offering this service to women, then it seems that the outcome you are looking for (determination of abortion as moral or immoral) has no purpose other than to place a value judgment on someone else's decision.

&gt;And if she misses a pill altogether? Has a drug interaction? Used an even less effective form, like withdrawal? Didn't use anything at all?

This isn't very complicated. If you aren't using birth control, I don't think you should be allowed to get an abortion. If you are protecting yourself you can get one. There's no reason to deliberately not take your pill if you dont want to get pregnant.

&gt;You're not supposed to use the perfect use statistics. Try 92% effectiveness. I wouldn't call birth control failure ""easy to avoid,"" either: it's just something that happens. It is easy to avoid having unprotected sex, but again: people make mistakes. 

If you read the link I posted you'll see the reasons why the percentage is lowered, it's entirely user error. Skipping days or vomitting the pill back up. We all have phones now, put an alarm on it reminding you to take your pill. Bam 98% effective.

&gt;Being pregnant *is* risking that, especially when it's unwanted and the woman was not prepared for it.  
You don't know if your mental health is at risk until you're actually experiencing it. You might expect things to be fine and, suddenly, they're not. I agree that if you don't want to become pregnant you should take reasonable precautions, but I don't agree that ""don't get pregnant"" is the only way to do that. Getting an abortion for a pregnancy you didn't want is part of being personally responsible.   

This is all fair enough, but is not common, they're exceptions not the rule and would fall under an abortion for health reasons, not an elective abortion. Yes I'm ok with getting an abortion because your health is significantly affected.

&gt;You also can't know how complicated your pregnancy will be until you've given birth. Why ask someone to take that chance at all? Even if it's rare, it's still their life we're talking about. 

This argument doesn't really make sense when the solution is ending a life that will soon develop into a person.

&gt;Birth control is a precaution, and it should be used any time someone is having sex and doesn't want a pregnancy. However, abortion is an important option to have in the event that the BC wasn't effective enough, failed, or wasn't used. And in my country we have to go to the ER for free healthcare and it's rushed and doesn't cover everything a pregnant woman needs because they'll just tell you to see your primary care or gynecologist, even if you don't have one and can't afford to get one. 

In my country there's plenty of free services that will provide the healthcare that is required. Yours should too, generally they simply require you to wait a long time to see the DR.

&gt;If a woman becomes pregnant and is barred from getting an abortion because it's illegal, they are being forced to continue the pregnancy. How does that not make sense to you?   

That's fine they're being forced to continue it but they weren't forced to start it if they aren't using birth control. 

&gt;No one chooses for their BC to fail, and sometimes oversight happens 

That's fine and I'm fine with those people getting abortions.

&gt;and people have sex without protection. Doesn't mean they deserve an unwanted pregnancy.   

Honestly I believe it does. If they don't want it don't have unprotected sex. Condoms aren't hard to use and they're not expensive.


&gt;You're right, I'm totally overstepping my boundaries telling people it's okay to want to take their medical care into their own hands and that it's okay to, you know, make decisions about their body.  
You don't see how that's different than telling someone that, because you disapprove, they shouldn't be allowed to have access to some medical care?  

You're right. I'm totally overstepping my boundaries telling people it's not ok to end a human life because they're Lazy.

&gt;It's not about being wrong on the internet; I don't give a fuck how wrong someone is on the internet. But as far as I know, you're a real person. And groups of real people *like you* are jeopardizing my ability to take care of my own body. And that kinda sucks. 

If you're being responsible about sex, how am I jeopardizing your health? 

&gt;What gave me the impression that you believe women deserve to be punished for using BC that is less effective than you approve of or not using it?

When have I said anything about approving of birth control? Unless we are talking about pulling out, which we all know doesn't work, most methods of birth control work very well.

&gt; Uh... maybe the fact that you believe those women should be *forced through an unwanted pregnancy despite any risk to their health*? I thought I made that pretty clear.  

Most of the time there's no real risk to their health. There's a chance sure, but the odds are not high.

&gt;And I don't believe I said you hated women. Yes, I said your position is sexist. Because it is, unless you think men should experience a similar ordeal when they don't use protection (pain, emotional turmoil, fined thousands of dollars, possibly having to raise a child they never wanted). In that case, it's still fucked up and wrong, but I'll take back the accusation that it's sexist. 

I support child support, so yep I do support that.

&gt;Again, that is a ""perfect use"" statistic, which is theoretical. The ""actual use"" statistics are condoms are 85% effective and BC pills are 92% effective.

Is it not your position that this *should* be law? And if so, who *could* judge women for what they choose to do with their own bodies? Who is qualified to do that, if not a woman and her doctor? 

&gt;So, if she's on birth control but it fails? I would say that's adequate protection. She is using it and the odds of a pregnancy resulting from missing a pill by a few hours are quite low.

And if she misses a pill altogether? Has a drug interaction? Used an even less effective form, like withdrawal? Didn't use anything at all?

 &gt;Yes, 98% reliability is ""notoriously unreliable."" If birth control fails I have no problem with them getting an abortion but this is a very easy mistake to avoid. 

You're not supposed to use the perfect use statistics. Try 92% effectiveness. I wouldn't call birth control failure ""easy to avoid,"" either: it's just something that happens. It is easy to avoid having unprotected sex, but again: people make mistakes. 

&gt;I don't think anyone who's pregnant should risk that, regardless of whether she wants the baby or not. If you're the sort of person who's mental health may be risked as a result of a pregnancy, you should be personally responsible and not get pregnant. The instances of women who risk their life to give birth are incredibly rare. 

Being pregnant *is* risking that, especially when it's unwanted and the woman was not prepared for it.  
You don't know if your mental health is at risk until you're actually experiencing it. You might expect things to be fine and, suddenly, they're not.

&gt;Unless they're a rape victim, they aren't being forced into it. If they chose not to use protection they weren't forced into it. Pick up any primary school health textbook and get to know the basics of sex.

If a woman becomes pregnant and is barred from getting an abortion because it's illegal, they are being forced to continue the pregnancy. How does that not make sense to you?   
No one chooses for their BC to fail, and sometimes oversight happens and people have sex without protection. Doesn't mean they deserve an unwanted pregnancy.   
In what primary school health textbook do they talk about how a woman isn't being forced to continue a pregnancy if they are barred from ending the pregnancy by their government...? 

&gt; So? You can't have an abortion before you're pregnant. What's your point? 

What? My point is that, if I were to find out I was pregnant, I would want to be able to get an abortion because *I can't know how it's going to turn out*. I won't know if it's dangerous until I have either finished delivering the baby or the pregnancy becomes dangerous. At that point, the damage is done. I'd rather opt out of that before it begins. 

&gt; Who the fuck are you to tell people it's ok to have an abortion? Oh, wait,this is reddit. Nobody's opinion matters here. The only thing that makes my opinion important you, because you took the time to respond. You could ignore me. But then someone might be wrong on the internet. Can't have that.

You're right, I'm totally overstepping my boundaries telling people it's okay to want to take their medical care into their own hands and that it's okay to, you know, make decisions about their body.

&gt; Condoms are 98% effective. The pill is 99% effective if used at the same time everyday.

Because it's my idea? You know I'm not actually a law maker? I don't have the power to make these changes. But yes you got me, if somehow this was made into law and could be enforced, I alone could not judge these women.

&gt;Also, what about mistakes? We're all human, we all make mistakes sometimes. If a woman is a few hours late on her BC pill, 

So, if she's on birth control but it fails? I would say that's adequate protection. She is using it and the odds of a pregnancy resulting from missing a pill by a few hours are quite low.


&gt;Using BC is a normal expectation, yes. I expect people to use protection if they're having sex. But that doesn't mean that BC is perfect (especially condoms, which are notoriously unreliable), and it certainly doesn't mean people are perfect. And still brings us back to the essential question: why do you believe women deserve to be punished so harshly for having BC that failed or for making a mistake? Why do you think that is okay?

Yes, 98% reliability is ""notoriously unreliable."" If birth control fails I have no problem with them getting an abortion but this is a very easy mistake to avoid. 

&gt;does she deserve to be forced to risk her life, sanity, and financial stability to give birth to a baby she didn't want? Is that her punishment?

I don't think anyone who's pregnant should risk that, regardless of whether she wants the baby or not. If you're the sort of person who's mental health may be risked as a result of a pregnancy, you should be personally responsible and not get pregnant. The instances of women who risk their life to give birth are incredibly rare. 

&gt;Pregnancy is expensive, first. It's less expensive in countries with good healthcare, but still more expensive than not being pregnant. 

Most first world countries have services have free prenatal and postnatal healthcare and if you're in a country where this isn't the case, take some precautions. 

&gt;Being forced into pregnancy and childbirth is emotionally traumatizing. If you can't see that then I'm not sure what to tell you. And grab a middle school health textbook to get the basics on how destructive it can be physically.

Unless they're a rape victim, they aren't being forced into it. If they chose not to use protection they weren't forced into it. Pick up any primary school health textbook and get to know the basics of sex.

And if they are the victim of rape I fully support them having the choice.

&gt;
And how do I know if I have a health issue like that until it's too late? Sure, I might know. But many women don't find out about it until they're pregnant. Sometimes not until they are pretty far along.

So? You can't have an abortion before you're pregnant. What's your point? 

&gt;
Who the fuck are you to tell people when it's ""fair"" for them to get an abortion, anyway? Again: what makes your opinion so important?

Who the fuck are you to tell people it's ok to have an abortion? Oh, wait,this is reddit. Nobody's opinion matters here. The only thing that makes my opinion important you, because you took the time to respond. You could ignore me. But then someone might be wrong on the internet. Can't have that.

&gt; For some reason, you believe that women who have sex fun should be punished for that. I won't speculate why here, but the why doesn't really matter. It's an unreasonable, sexist position to have no matter why you hold it.

What gave you that impression? I'm happy for anyone to have sex with consenting adults. I just think they should use protection.

This whole, ""You think this because you hate women"" bullshit is just that, bullshit. It's not an argument, it's an attack on someone's character that's completely baseless, Because I disagree with you I'm sexist? Ok? 

&gt;
But those two methods are both pretty unreliable, no other BC is 100% effective, people make mistakes, and cost isn't even the issue here. The issue is that women deserve access to abortion because it is a part of women's healthcare.

Maybe they're unreliable if you can't figure out how to unroll a condom or swallow a pill at dinner every night. Luckily they have classes for that now.

Condoms are 98% effective. The pill is 99% effective if used at the same time everyday. https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill 

Using them together properly gives you odds of 0.02% of getting pregnant.

370,"&gt;Yeah I think everyone should be using protection if they don't want kids. What a ridiculous suggestion. 

What a ridiculous attempt at deflection. 

If you'll notice, what I asked was this: 

""So childbirth is a way of punishing women for not **""adequately""** protecting themselves?"" 

Added emphasis to make sure you didn't miss it this time. What is adequate to you? Why do you make the standards? Why should I care what you think about my birth control method? 

Also, what about mistakes? We're all human, we all make mistakes sometimes. If a woman is a few hours late on her BC pill, does she deserve to be forced to risk her life, sanity, and financial stability to give birth to a baby she didn't want? Is that her punishment? 

&gt;Using a condom properly isn't exactly a high standard. Why are you having unprotected sex if you don't want a kid?

Using BC is a normal expectation, yes. I expect people to use protection if they're having sex. But that doesn't mean that BC is perfect (especially condoms, which are notoriously unreliable), and it certainly doesn't mean people are perfect. And still brings us back to the essential question: why do you believe women deserve to be punished so harshly for having BC that failed or for making a mistake? Why do you think that is okay? 

Who said anything about having unprotected sex regularly despite not wanting a kid? Wasn't me. 

&gt;I don't live in a third world country where getting pregnant results in emotional, financial or physical ""destruction."" 

You either don't live on Earth, which is impressive, or you are woefully ill-informed about what pregnancy is, which is more likely. Pregnancy is expensive, first. It's less expensive in countries with good healthcare, but still more expensive than not being pregnant. Being forced into pregnancy and childbirth is emotionally traumatizing. If you can't see that then I'm not sure what to tell you. And grab a middle school health textbook to get the basics on how destructive it can be physically. 

&gt;If you have a health issue that might be exacerbated during a pregnancy, I feel that's a fair reason to have an abortion

And how do I know if I have a health issue like that until it's too late? Sure, I *might* know. But many women don't find out about it until they're pregnant. Sometimes not until they are pretty far along. 

Who the fuck are you to tell people when it's ""fair"" for them to get an abortion, anyway? Again: what makes your opinion so important?

371,"&gt;When someone engages in sexual activity, they are engaging in activity that is geared towards creating a human life utterly dependent on them for survival.

I don't know what kind of sex your having, but the kind of sex I have is much more fun than that. I'm definitely not trying to get a ""human life utterly dependent on [me]"" when I have sex. I'm trying to have some fun, connect with my fiance, and... well, no, that's it actually. Have fun and connect. No babies. 

&gt;You can't engage in that activity and than pretend you have the right to 'withdraw' your consent to that life at any time during pregnancy.

Well, personally, I wouldn't have consented to being pregnant in the first place. So that fetus never would have had my consent to live in my uterus. 

But you know the great thing about abortion? Even if I *had* consented to it living there, I could still withdraw my consent during the pregnancy. It's like sex: if I say I want to have sex, start having sex, and then realize I don't want to continue, I can stop. Because something changed and I'm not feeling it anymore. Or because something changed and I *can't* do it anymore, even if I want to. 

&gt;Prolifers are fighting to restrict women. Couldn't possibly because abortion kills a human being.

Some anti-choicers are the way they are because, for some reason, they honestly believe fetuses deserve more protection than grown women. I say that's ridiculous, but you're right: some of them honestly do believe abortion is murder and that is why they are anti-choice. 

But let's be honest here. Other anti-choicers simply believe women deserve to be punished for having consensual sex for fun or they believe their god/s told them to think that way or they just don't know any better. I'd say most anti-choicers, honestly, but that's anecdotal. 

&gt;Maybe they should accept that actions have consequences, and accept that they must learn to deal with it. 

Yes, and they/we have. The fact is, sex *does* have consequences, and we all need to realize that and deal with them as they come. One consequence of sex is emotional attachment, so what do you do? You evaluate, before having sex with someone, how it might affect your emotions and you proceed or not based on the answer to that question. Another is STI's, so you get tested regularly and wear condoms with new partners. And another consequence is pregnancy, so you use birth control and you have a plan. You decide if you're going to abort, give it up for adoption, or keep it, and you have something in place for your decision. 

Why do people not understand that getting an abortion *is* dealing with a pregnancy? 

&gt;Less than 1% of all abortions are preformed because of rape. This argument does nothing to invalidate arguments on why abortion should be illegal.

I mean, it is important though. Rape victims still exist, even if they make up a small portion of abortions being performed. They're still important. 

&gt; You just compared being raped to being forced to take consequences for your actions.

They compared one non-consensual bodily invasion with another non-consensual bodily invasion. Seems pretty solid to me. ",2,1493789855,2017-05-03 01:37:35

In other words, they will keep living because of the metabolic and chemical processes within them but they do have a conscience that cares whether they live or die.

But at this you're again, discriminating(in a neutral meaning) who deserves life or not. You say plants can be killed because they don't have X,Y or Z, even though they are alive. I don't disagree with it, and it's a part of the abortion debate, but I do think we can discriminate between things, and make the best of it that we can. I see that there's a difference between humans and other animals, and between animals and plants.

&gt; With that being said, if you want to preserve plant life veganism is the way to go.

I agree with that. But my issue is more of all or nothing. If taking life is bad, then taking less life is still wrong, just not AS wrong. But is it wrong to eat plants? Most would agree that eating your wife for example is wrong, but only a small number believe that eating plants is wrong or equivalent. It's hard to see the line, but I do believe there's a line. I still need to think more on this.

&gt; This however is a very extreme scenario. I just don't agree with the notion that it isn't okay under any circumstance and that is what pro-life means (atleast in the US). I would argue that it would be more immoral forcing an 11 year old to carry a child than to abort.

I agree that there are certain cases where it an abortion should be permissible, just as there are certain cases where murder should be permissible. I don't necessarily agree on the rape case, I'm also torn, because while I feel for the raped woman, I don't think it makes murder right, as in two wrongs don't make a right. In life-threatening scenarios then yes, I agree.
Most abortions though, specially in the US aren't in those extreme cases, most abortions fall more into the irresponsible birth control category.

&gt; I think we have alot of similar ideas and perhaps they would be even more similar if we lived in the same place. I believe the abortion debate is different in the US than anywhere else.

It's probably true, I didn't know what pro-life meant but I definitely agree that we should reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies in the first place, that should be paramount.

I don't think this discussion will be more fruitful, because we already agree on the important parts, and I want to thank you for such a pleasant and constructive conversation.",2,1493405375,2017-04-28 14:49:35
385,"&gt;I agree totally with you. I do believe each of us has a spirit-although I don't think that for other people it's a convincing argument, so I don't debate that- and ascribe more value to human life. I went through a phase where I was a vegan, but then I also wondered that plants had lives too and I do believed there was a superiority to human life to plant life. I then wondered what was then I to eat? Humans can't survive on nuts and fruit only, so it would seem that the taking of life was a requirement for life. I rebelled against it but saw no possible resolution to the dilemma.

I think I can help you a little with this! The overall philosophy of veganism is to cause as little harm as possible. We know that its not feasible to cause absolutely no damage at all. Our homes displace wildlife and sometimes we need medication that has animal products. But what we can do is limit the damage as much as possible. Now, I'm not under the impression that plants are sentient. I study Biology, currently working on a masters in Genetics and so I feel I can make a good judgement on where the line is drawn in terms of what organisms are truly living and which ones merely have metabolic processes. Plants do not have feelings, they do not feel fear or love and most importantly they do not feel pain. They have no mechanism that would allow for them to want to live. In other words, they will keep living because of the metabolic and chemical processes within them but they do have a conscience that cares whether they live or die. 

With that being said, if you want to preserve plant life veganism is the way to go. In America, 70 to 80 percent of our corn, wheat, oats and soy are fed to the 10 billion land animals who are killed annually. Worldwide, 60 to 70 percent of the plants are fed to 60 billion land animals. So if humans stopped eating flesh, then fewer plants would be harvested; remember, a single vegan directly consumes about one-tenth of the plant material that is either directly or indirectly consumed by a single carnivorous human. So the path with the lease suffering would easily be veganism. 

Ah so now that I finished my rant we can move on (:

&gt;I can say from personal experience that even being informed and a somewhat logical person there have been times where even having condoms in my literal hand I decided not to use them at the spurr of the moment. 

Me too! Well I mean I've had partners that didn't use them - while I was on birth control but like I said we should always use 2 methods. I have to admit I would even forgo any form of bc when I was in high school. I only had one partner and we thought pull out method was effective. Now that I'm older and more responsible I can't believe I did that. I had every resource needed for safe sex I just didn't think anything would happen. Thank goodness that never lead to any pregnancies... anyywho I think that in situations such as that, if I were to have gotten pregnant then I ought to carry the child. Having willfully engaged in unprotected sex where there was option not to do so. So I wouldn't say I support abortion in every capacity then. But there are scenarios in which I would so I cannot claim to be pro-life. For example, in a situation where a very young girl were raped I would think the best course of action would be abortion. This however is a very extreme scenario. I just don't agree with the notion that it isn't okay under any circumstance and that is what pro-life means (atleast in the US). I would argue that it would be more immoral forcing an 11 year old to carry a child than to abort.

I think we have alot of similar ideas and perhaps they would be even more similar if we lived in the same place. I believe the abortion debate is different in the US than anywhere else. Pro lifers here get a bad rap because they pull ridiculous stunts and its frequently in the media. Things such as gathering outside clinics (that offer many services other than abortion) and harassing women as they walk by. We actually have people whose job it is to walk women into the clinics (99% of whom are there for a mammogram, pap smear or birth control!) because they may be physically attacked. They are mostly comprised of people who believe sex is exclusive to marriage (which is fine but its a personal choice) and they protest better access to birth control because ""women should just keep their legs shut"". Maybe its different in other countries, I actually really hope it is. I can get with the protection of babies - but I wont believe that is your goal unless your also supporting everything we know to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies in the first place",2,1493398878,2017-04-28 13:01:18
386,"&gt; So I suppose I should say at this point that I'm starting to agree with you more.

I don't mind big walls of text, in fact I prefer them, there's more material to ponder. You don't know how much I appreciate you being open minded, it's very hard to find a person on the internet who's open to having their thoughts challenged and it's a very courageous thing to do, I thank and applaud you for that.

&gt; But how many people who are pro-life because they ""respect the sanctity of life"" also eat meat and wear leather? I would argue that if you're pro life you ought to also be a vegan. And if you aren't then your following the same line of thinking as someone who is pro choice

I agree totally with you. I do believe each of us has a spirit-although I don't think that for other people it's a convincing argument, so I don't debate that- and ascribe more value to human life. I went through a phase where I was a vegan, but then I also wondered that plants had lives too and I do believed there was a superiority to human life to plant life. I then wondered what was then I to eat? Humans can't survive on nuts and fruit only, so it would seem that the taking of life was a requirement for life. I rebelled against it but saw no possible resolution to the dilemma. I expressed my points to everyone hoping for a resolution and everyone told me I was crazy, even people I believe to be wiser than me, so I saw that I was doing something that was unnatural for me, unhealthy and dangerous and possibly even contradictory and everybody from different ideologies all thought I was being ridiculous and without resolving it, thought that yes, maybe I was in a ridiculous path that I refused to see it's ridiculousness, so I reverted my position and gave it no further thought other than to not eat from places where I know they treat animals in extremely inhumane ways.
You could say the same about any other murder in history, where if you were anything less than a vegan it would be hypocritical to condemn murder.
It may be a contradiction but I haven't resolved that dilemma, because even though I believe there's a superiority on man vs animal because of our spirit, I reject the system where we have to kill in order to survive, but I didn't choose that system, if I don't follow it, I die. So I agree that it's a contradiction in my ideology, or at the very least a point of tension that needs to be resolved, I just don't know how in a sensible, reasonable, realistic way. By the way, it's not the only contradiction in my philosophies, I try to resolve as many as I can and to be as consistent as I can, but sometimes it's extremely hard to resolve such a conflict and it has been years since I had explored this conundrum, so maybe I can now resolve it(at the very least, I'll break my head trying to solve it once more :P)

&gt; This is why I and many others think that the pro life movement just seeks to punish women for sex. It comes off as hypocritical. But I would be willing to change my mind on that in the future if things change.
I think what needs to happen is a rebranding of sorts. The pro life crowd has gotten a bad rap. Partly because although there are individuals like you who want to save the babies there are individuals who are sexist and want to punish women for engaging in sex. This is what the pro choice side gets up in arms about. Because we hear about the misogynists and the ridiculous laws they're trying to pass all to emotional abuse women who choose abortion.

I live in a different country so I'm not as familiar with the pro-life movement. At the beginning of this post I thought pro-life just meant that you were for the life of the unborn. I don't really know who started the movement or what does it mean currently but it seems that it's mostly done by the Catholic Church and I understand why pro-choicers see it as a movement against sexuality(as the Church does) and why birth control always comes to the panel, it seems they are extremely against birth control, go figure.

&gt; Better access to cheaper or free birth control. Allow kids to get birth control without parents knowing. Put more resources into creating a birth control for males. Emphasize that you need to use two forms of birth control at all times. Try IUD and a condom. The pill and pull out method. Whatever works but you need two incase one fails. Also bring more attention to the IUD. The pill realistically should not be the #1 form of birth control. It's only 99.9% effective in a lab setting. IUD is the most effective form of BC for people with vaginas

I agree. Although condoms are very cheap(and you can ask for free condoms) synergic birth control is the way to go. That's how I did my math of the 3 women in 10k. I used to date a chemist who used IUD but always demanded I use a condom. If people are taught to combine multiple birth controls synergistically(IUD, condom, pull out and fertility awareness are the ones I used, which complement each other and are safe and easy) then the actual possibility of getting pregnant even being fully active throughout a decade is nearly null.

&gt; More comprehensive sex ed beginning at an appropriate age. Starting in high school is too late.

It's a minor point but I actually disagree that the problem of sex education is the issue. Most people know about sex long before that. Even in my school that was catholic everyone knew about sex, pregnancy and condoms since like age 10? What is part of it is a more responsible use of birth control as per the previous point, most people don't know that's a possibility and it's safe. Nevertheless I think that the sexual drive for reproduction is pretty strong and during sex the animal part overrides the logical one and people will still be pregnant. I can say from personal experience that even being informed and a somewhat logical person there have been times where even having condoms in my literal hand I decided not to use them at the spurr of the moment. Or when I was deeply in love with my girlfriend I would stop using condoms, while knowing the dangers consciously, my subconscious didn't care, it WANTED for both of us to get her pregnant(because she was the same).

***

I agree on all your points about the bigger solutions to abortions and to a better life for the family. If we all had a heart that strives more for unity and compassion things would be very different. Sometimes we as humans put so much faith in our own faulty reasoning, philosophies and disregard another key part of being human, which is our heightened sensibilities. This is an actual good point I saw on a Hitler speech(I'm definitely not in favour of Hitler at all, but I have always been curious about how and why was he able to move a whole nation of sensitive, intelligent human beings in order to do the things he did) when he said ""Rich people say why should I help the poor. But it's not rich people helping poor people, it's Germany saving Germany"", if we extend that to humanity with disregard to many false notions of society and we as humans helped us other humans, we could advance extremely fast. We now use our resources selfishly, and wage war against ourselves in many fronts, instead of standing united and strong, I believe. If someone was born poor, so what if ""they chose to be poor"",""their parents should have made better choices"",""it's not a good politic"",""the government is not your father"" and just help one another, what would the world be? Surely there will always be a small portion that will want to abuse things, but when we're talking about human lifes and making humanity better, what does it matter in the big picture? I don't know, I'm just ranting xD",1,1493344935,2017-04-27 22:02:15
387,"Prepare for a wall of text haha I'm sorry in advance! (:

&gt; What takes for a person to go beyond that is actual philosophical ideas, and that's why we should combat those wrong philosohopical ideas that make people behave immorally.

This is an idea that I completely agree with. Throughout history there has always been disagreements of who deserves rights and who does not. In recent times there are debates of whether homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight people or whether transgender people deserve the same rights as cis people. As a vegan I believe that other animals deserve the same rights as humans and so I can empathize with your point that unborn humans deserve the same rights as ones that are born. So I suppose I should say at this point that I'm starting to agree with you more. As a society we have decided that murder is wrong. Murder defined as taking the life of another individual without their consent (i only add the last part because I think physician assisted suicide is different than murder) but anyway.... we say murder is wrong and then justify murders for our own satisfaction or convenience. I'm sure you understand what I'm saying but I'll give you a couple examples:

- racists in the old south partook in lynchings because philosophically they were convinced that POC were less than them and didn't deserve rights. YET they had laws against murder and would consider it completely wrong if a white person was killed

- people in our society get very worked up when it comes to cases of animal cruelty. In 2015 a man intentionally ran over 9 ducklings with his car and when the news went viral he received countless death threats. People all over social media wishes horrible things upon him and he was eventually sentenced to 1 year in prison. YET the same people likely regularly eat chicken nuggets which are made of... yep ground up male chicks

So I'm assuming from your stance of pro life that you are frustrated with people saying murder is wrong and then saying BUT! It's not wrong to murder X group because they are less than. I understand that and I empathize with that. But how many people who are pro-life because they ""respect the sanctity of life"" also eat meat and wear leather? I would argue that if you're pro life you ought to also be a vegan. And if you aren't then your following the same line of thinking as someone who is pro choice. You respect the sanctity of life but you limit it to certain groups. You feel that for whatever reason it is okay to murder animals because they are less than humans. It's the same line of thinking that someone who is pro choice is making when they say the an embryo does not have the same rights as a human who is already born. 

This is why *I* and many others think that the pro life movement just seeks to punish women for sex. It comes off as hypocritical. But I would be willing to change my mind on that in the future if things change.

I think what needs to happen is a rebranding of sorts. The pro life crowd has gotten a bad rap.

This is what the pro choice side gets up in arms about. Because we hear about the misogynists and the ridiculous laws they're trying to pass all to emotional abuse women who choose abortion. 

Not wanting abortions to happen is okay. But making abortion illegal and restricting access to safe medical procedures that the person is likely to otherwise attempt at home should not be the main goal. You need to get ahead of that and make changes so that women aren't even wanting to get an abortion. We need:

- More comprehensive sex ed beginning at an appropriate age. Starting in high school is too late. 

- Better access to cheaper or free birth control. Allow kids to get birth control without parents knowing. Put more resources into creating a birth control for males. Emphasize that you need to use two forms of birth control at all times. Try IUD and a condom. The pill and pull out method. Whatever works but you need two incase one fails. Also bring more attention to the IUD. The pill realistically should not be the #1 form of birth control. It's only 99.9% effective in a lab setting. IUD is the most effective form of BC for people with vaginas 

Also consider some people end their pregnancy because they literally cannot afford to have a child. To fix that we need: 

- Better maternity leave and paternity leave. We need to take care of working mothers and fathers so it isn't greatly hurting their career when they have a child. 

- Cheaper child care. Possibly heavily subsidized. This is a huge issue with the lower class. They need more money so they need to work more but can't because child care is so expensive. This will also help mothers who haven't finished school. That's a huge demographic for abortions. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a family member that will babysit for free.

- Cheaper insurance and better government assistance programs for food and necessities. If you are self employed or do not work for a large company with benefits, insurance will nearly make you go broke. I was charged - I kid you not *$60,000* for the delivery of my daughter. I didn't need any sort of huge medical intervention. I had pitocin to speed up the process and delivered vaginally (TMI?). I cannot even imagine the astronomical cost of a child who needs to stay in the NICU or a mother who needs other emergency treatments. Fortunately we have great insurance but everyone is not so lucky. On toP of that my daughters insurance costs $350 per month. My husband - a staunch republican, likes to say that people need to get a job and they wouldn't need to mooch of the government. I think this is a very pervasive belief and one that stops us from expanding government assistance. I like to remind him that we were fortunate enough to have the resources to go to college and that it takes him 7 hours of work to pay that; it would take someone making minimum wage nearly 40. 

These are the things we need to think about and take action on. This is what the pro life community needs to focus their attention to. Preventing abortion at a legal level should not be the main objective. Allow mothers to know that they have resources and that it will be okay. Couple that with access to birth control for everyone and you're going to see a serious reduction in abortions.

394,"**Trump Thinks This Is Pro-Life?**




PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — When President Trump and his (male) aides sit at a conference table deciding to cut off money to women’s health programs abroad, they call it a “pro-life” move.


Yet here in Haiti, I’ll tell you the result: Impoverished women suffer ghastly injuries and excruciating deaths. Washington’s new women’s health policies should be called “pro-death.”


When women and girls don’t have access to family planning and reproductive health care, they’re more likely to suffer pelvic organ prolapses, in which the bladder, uterus or bowel may protrude from the vagina. Or they suffer a fistula, a childbirth injury that leaves them leaking urine or feces, stinking and ostracized, and sometimes unable to walk. Women with prolapses or fistulas sit in their huts, humiliated, wondering if they are cursed, waiting to die.


In a room here in the Haitian capital, women with cervical and breast cancer wait for nurses to examine their ulcerated bodies. Beyond their almost unbearable physical pain is their mortification that they smell of rotting flesh, and in some cases incontinence. They are heroic in their quiet refusal to give up.


It’s not that these horrific conditions are caused by U.S. policy, but Trump is now halting all funds for many organizations working tirelessly to prevent this suffering. First came the “global gag rule,” ending funding to overseas health aid groups linked in some way to abortion, including counseling that mentions it as an option.


The latest is that Trump just cut every penny the U.S. provides the United Nations Population Fund. This organization has nothing to do with abortions but is a central player in the global effort to fight for women’s health.


“If the U.N. Population Fund has less money, more impoverished women in Haiti will die,” said Holdie Fleurilus, a nurse at Innovating Health International, which runs the cancer center I visited.


Across town, Dr. Raymond Fleurimon, the medical director of the Isaïe Jeanty Maternity Hospital, was equally blunt: “If U.N.F.P.A. is out of the game,” he said, using the initials of the fund’s old name, “this maternity ward will collapse, it’ll be completely dysfunctional, and more women will die.”


“What a nightmare,” warned Dr. Rahel Nardos, a women’s health expert, cautioning that less money for the fund meant more prolapses and fistulas.


Republicans pushed to cut off the money because they think the fund colludes with China’s government in forced abortions there. But I lived in China for years, reporting extensively on the subject — and the critics have it all wrong.


Yes, China has relied on forced sterilizations and forced abortions. The U.N. Population Fund initially was oblivious, and in 1983 it stupidly gave a gold medal to the Chinese official overseeing forced abortions. But that’s history, and for decades the fund has put strong pressure on China to end the coerced abortions.


Moreover, the fund persuaded China in 1992 to switch to a more effective IUD, averting half a million abortions a year. Over the years, that’s 12 million abortions the Population Fund has prevented there. Can any anti-abortion group match that?


Those affected by Trump’s cutoff of funds for women’s health are people like Darling Leonce, a pregnant 16-year-old I met when she showed up for a prenatal exam at a one-day clinic set up in a remote part of southeastern Haiti. The clinic was supported by the U.N. Population Fund, and it was the first interaction Darling had ever had with a doctor or nurse in her life.


Darling never went to school, can’t read or write, and had never heard of birth control. Yet here she received her first-ever physical exam and was encouraged to deliver in a hospital rather than in her village. A nurse coached her on breast-feeding, gave her prenatal vitamins and acquainted her with contraception.


“Choose your partner carefully, and don’t have a kid just because you have a boyfriend,” the nurse advised.


Politicians in Washington don’t have a clue about the hideous things that happen when women are marginalized and health care is unavailable. What the Population Fund does is help girls like Darling avoid unwanted pregnancies and the nightmare of a fistula, a prolapse or cancer. That’s why The Lancet medical journal called Trump’s cutoff of funds “misogyny.”


Oh, and on abortion — one more thing.


When contraception is unavailable, people find ways to get abortions even where it’s illegal, as it is here. On my way back to the capital from the one-day clinic, I stopped at a pharmacy in a small town and asked for misoprostol, an abortion drug. For $15, the sales clerk handed over more than enough pills for an abortion.


The birth control provided by the U.N. Population Fund averted more than 3.7 million abortions last year alone, health advocates say. So if you’re against abortion, you should support the U.N. Population Fund, not try to destroy it.


Yet a group of blundering men in the Trump administration posture as moral leaders, and the result is that women in places like Haiti will suffer fistulas, prolapses and agonizing deaths in childbirth or from cervical cancer. Some of these women will be humiliated by the failures of their flesh, but the real shame belongs to sanctimonious zealots in Washington who don’t have a clue what they’re doing.


And this is pro-life?

396,"The first article you linked me, besides the fact that it's source was obviously created to advance an agenda and a quick google search exposes some intellectually and ethically dishonest [practices](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2011/02/04/why-is-live-action-doctoring-its-planned-parent/175992),isn't very convincing because it admits *itself* that there is more nuance to the conclusion than you are letting on. They use Poland as an example, but somewhat dismissively state that they do not have the data on abortions that occur illegally, so they are missing some key information there and clearly don't know the rate at which abortions are actually occurring. They also use Ireland as an example of low MMR, but even admit themselves that it is very easy and commonplace for Irish women to go to neighboring countries like England to have abortions, so that claim is definitely questionable. The article seems to gloss over some very important facts that don't necessarily confirm it's general viewpoint. Meanwhile, [this](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/news/abortion-rates/en/) study from the World Health Organization reports that abortion rates have recently declined in developed nations but stayed the same in developing ones. 88% of abortions performed were also done in developing nations. If you look at the [abortion laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law) in the [developing countries](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/developing-regions), the general trend, with some notable exceptions, is for their laws to be much for restrictive than those in further developed countries. This also strengthens a point that I made in my previous reply to you, that abortion rates are much more fundamentally tied to economic welfare and social safety nets than they are to legislation. It makes sense that people living in countries where poverty is most common are more likely to not want to have children. People who are unable to support themselves aren't going to feel like they can raise a child, or even go through the process of [pregnancy and delivery](http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-costs/). 

I actually looked up the original [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036613) referenced in the second article you linked, and the reported results simply don't support what you are implying. It links the low MMR rate with women's educational opportunities, delivery by skilled attendants, clean water, and sanitary sewer access. It even states that ""The slope of the MMR did not appear to be altered by the change in abortion law."" Correlation =/= causation. Also, as a counterexample, when Ceausescu banned abortion and family planning in Romania, it actually had very [serious consequences](http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/overplanned_parenthood.htm) to put it mildly, for mothers and children alike. [Here's](https://np.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/4xpo8q/my_parents_in_the_romanian_air_force_in_the_1980s/d6i0zzq/) an interesting account from a Romanian Redditor who lived through this time that confirms this. There's even a harrowing but well-done [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Underground) about the inhumane conditions that the unwanted children of this regime faced.

398,"Your formatting is wrong :P

&gt; Do a pedophiles wants trump the rights of his victims? Absolutely not. Is it okay to avoid bodily harm at the cost of someone else? I would say yes. I know some people disagree

Oh ok, I now get what you mean, and I agree to a point. We don't always know what's right and what's wrong, even when we believe we do. The only thing we CAN do is try to be closer to the truth and go with that, and that works for everything else, including for example science. Objects do fall for a reason. Is the theory of gravity the truth of why this is? In the future we could discover that this was wrong(as it has happened several times) or that it was incomplete, yet for us is true, not because we want to believe it, or because people say it is, or because we feel it is true, but because it's the closes to true we have based on reason and experimentation. The same would apply to morality.

The issue with your example is for example the pedophiles would disagree with you. Then what happens, do we simply say ""oh well, we agree to disagree, keep at it""? We need to deepen on the subject, although to touch on a previous point, we aren't pedophiles because we have reasoned that it's immoral, there's a natural morality sense in us that doesn't even make it an option except for certain individuals. You'd have to have a low level of empathy for it, while most humans have a high level of empathy, plus the biological nature of how our own human sexuality works(there's a reason why we aren't attracted to kids). The same works for a mother, she doesn't NOT kill her baby because of a philosophical stance, but rather because of a biological ""compass"" within her that wouldn't even allow her to consider it. What takes for a person to go beyond that is actual philosophical ideas, and that's why we should combat those wrong philosohopical ideas that make people behave immorally.
So, it's not enough to say ""I would say yes. I know some people disagree"" but to actually justify that, which is the purpose of the debate.

&gt; This would bring us to an impasse and discussing this matter is essentially the difference between pro choice and pro life so I don't believe it would be productive.

As you say this is the crux of the matter, therefore I believe it would be productive to address it because it's the underlying issue. So to not make this lengthier, let me just ask you, what is the justification for the difference between an embryo and a born human? I mean, a toddler is evidently different than a 25 year old, but that doesn't justify the killing of it. So how do you justify the killing of an embryo? Any human while unconscious will not feel fear while you kill it, but that's not justification enough because.. well... we don't kill other humans when they lose consciousness. So why is it important in a fetus?

&gt; I would say that the merciful thing to do would be to not begin that life at all.

You're saying that it's merciful because of the harsh life they will lead. But as I said, it's key that you answer: why is this different from an unborn human to an already born human? If that human will lead a harsh enough life that it's better to never have been born in the first place, then in the name of that very ""mercy"" I should kill those children who have been born already, but life is going to be harsh still, and it's only going to get harsher.

What would I do? Well, I don't actually agree with the premise that it's a common thing in the US, so it's not a very relevant scenario. Most scenarios aren't even because of real mercy towards the baby but rather because of the mother thinking of herself rather than the baby(you may not call it selfishness, but by all definitions it is). If I were the baby I would still would prefer to be born, even in poverty, even with abusive parents, even in a dysfunctional family, I would still prefer to be alive. If a person in that scenario really prefers to be death they would kill themselves. Death is not out of their reach, yet people in those scenarios value life, and don't kill themselves. Suicide is actually higher amongst the ""privileged"" bracket",1,1493246406,2017-04-26 18:40:06
399,"&gt;There are no ""right or wrong"" morals. There is no ultimate truth when it comes to morality.
I think you misunderstood what I meant when I said this. I suppose i worded it in a bad way. I should have been more direct in saying that in some cultures, self preservation is above all. What some people would call selfish, others would call putting themselves first. I only agree with this principle in regards to something that personally affects you and your bodily autonomy. For example, if you were about to get in a car accident and you could chose to swerve into a motorcyclist rather than get hit that would be a question of your morals. Do you save yourself before someone else? Would your answer be different if say, you would only lose one of your arms in the crash but if you hit the motorcyclist they would die? Not everyone would answer the same. 
I make this distinction that the scenario has to involve your own bodily autonomy because I wouldn't go as far to say you could only care about yourself in every scenario. Do a pedophiles wants trump the rights of his victims? Absolutely not. Is it okay to avoid bodily harm at the cost of someone else? I would say yes. I know some people disagree

&gt;The problem with this argument is that it equally applies to a toddler or an infant. Or even people in the foster care system. Do you think the merciful thing is to murder them? If you answer no, then you're also contradicting your own argument, I believe

Being that we are on different sides of an argument I don't think that we can talk about this point. I do not agree that an embryo is equal to a human that has already been born and you do. This would bring us to an impasse and discussing this matter is essentially the difference between pro choice and pro life so I don't believe it would be productive. But I would be curious to know what your plan would be for those children if abortion was made illegal. What would we do with all of the children that are now in foster care? How would we deal with mothers that don't have the money to pay for proper pre natal care? I would argue that a life in which a child has no stability, no guardian to call their own, no special attention, a fear for the future without the little resources that they do have and little hope for the situation to improve is just horrible. I would say that the merciful thing to do would be to not begin that life at all. A fetus at 10 or 12 weeks does not have consciousness and they will not feel fear.",1,1493244703,2017-04-26 18:11:43

401,"&gt; There are no ""right or wrong"" morals. There is no ultimate truth when it comes to morality.

What you are referring to is moral relativism. I've debated it several times and it's such an inane position that I grow tired of debating it.
 
You are basically saying that raping a 3 year old kid for your purpose is morally equivalent to picking your nose. Neither is good, nor right, they are just *different*. This is morally disgusting and absurd in all ways. I can go to greater depths if you wish, because I think you are an intelligent and open person and I can maybe convince you why moral relativism(in all the forms I've been introduced to it) leads to such an absurd proposition, but maybe by showing you two extremely different examples you can see that they're obviously different and can't be conflated to being the same morally and being just a matter of preference. You're basically saying that slavery isn't wrong for example, or that burning someone to death isn't any more wrong than let's say helping a homeless guy to transform his life in a productive manner, both are morally the same but just a matter of preference like you would say 'gouda cheese' is preferable to 'cheddar cheese'. If you saw someone raping their child you wouldn't go 'meh, some people have weird sexual preferences', you would know it to be wrong and stop it. Patently absurd but I believe you are a reasonable individual with whom having a discussion about this will not be a waste of time.

&gt; I think this statement is too easy to say when you yourself cannot physically become pregnant.

Meh, even if I could become physically pregnant I would have still have had a real experience of pregnancy, so that would leave mothers as the only people 'in the panel' sort of speak. I can't get pregnant, but if I knock someone up I'm expected to take care of not only the child, but of her, not for 9 months but for a whole longer time. Biologically women have it worse, economically/socially fathers have it 'worse'. I'm actually fascinated by pregnancy, and see motherhood as something short of a miracle, and I worship women's faculty of birthing life. If I could, I wouldn't resist against it, I would be awed and fascinated. But that's just me, someone might answer differently.

Rapes are a small case of abortions. When we talk about abortions, we're almost never talking about rape. We CAN talk about rape and abortion, but we first have to deal with the most normal of abortions, which aren't rape. BTW, if I were raped and got pregnant(in your hypothetical scenario), killing the baby wouldn't even cross my mind. When false positive kind scenarios have happened, and I thought I was going to be a father with a girl I wouldn't have chosen as life partner, having all the social and economic pressure, I was bummed but abortion never crossed my mind. But all of these are opinions. We're talking about something that trascends opinions, which is morality.

Just a question, if you don't believe in right and wrong, why are you even debating me? What I'm doing, from your position, isn't wrong, you just don't like it. Why don't you just avoid it instead like you avoid for example listening to music you don't like? Why do you even bother to justify your position? After all, all moral claims are a matter of preference, and preference doesn't need justification right? Your behaviour contradicts your moralistic views.

&gt; You should understand that the pro-choice side is not pro-abortion.

If you're in favour of abortion, then you're factly pro-abortion, but let's not discuss semantics.

&gt; I do not like abortions

If there is no moral right or wrong, it's just a matter of preference, isn't you saying 'I do not like abortions' saying you dislike abortions while at the same time morally defending it?

&gt; In my opinion, sometimes the most merciful thing to do is prevent an embryo from growing any further. I don't want any more children to be subjected to the foster care system and we currently have no plans or resources to fix it.

The problem with this argument is that it equally applies to a toddler or an infant. Or even people in the foster care system. Do you think the merciful thing is to murder them? If you answer no, then you're also contradicting your own argument, I believe

",1,1493238723,2017-04-26 16:32:03
402,"&gt; Yes, but self defense is moral because of reasons, rather than because society at large says it is.

Morals stem from what society at large says is correct. There are no ""right or wrong"" morals. There is no ultimate truth when it comes to morality. Our sense of right and wrong comes from our upbringing, the environment around us, our experiences etc. Some societies do not believe that killing is immoral. Some believe that anything is moral in the pursuit of personal gain. You cannot say one is right and one is wrong. They are simply different.

&gt;So I state that if you want to have sex, be responsible for your own birth control, and if you get pregnant, you can't wiggle out of it, specially by killing another human being.

I think this statement is too easy to say when you yourself cannot physically become pregnant. You cannot know what it would be like to be forced to support another organism with your own flesh and blood. To know that it may kill you. 
Imagine a world in which men are physically able to carry children. Imagine that you always use condoms and engage in responsible sex but you are raped and become pregnant. Would you refuse to take a pill that would prevent that 4 celled organism from developing into a child? Would you give up the rest of your life for that child rather that prevent it from growing? I wouldn't and I don't think it's reasonable to expect anyone to carry that child to term.


&gt;I don't see it particularly effective as we're sexual beings since around age 13
This is true and the scary thing is that girls are getting their periods and becoming fertile earlier than ever before. A significant number get it even before 3rd or 4th grade. These girls are still children themselves. Would you argue in favor of forcing an 11 year old who was raped to carry to term? I can't imagine any scenario in which that would be the right thing to do. Their bodies aren't meant for it and there is a very high chance of life threatening complications. Forcing a child through a pregnancy would be extremely cruel to the point where I would consider it to be child abuse if they didn't not abort.
Would you still not want to allow abortion in this case? If you say you would allow it that opens up the question of what other scenarios would it be acceptable in?


&gt;That's why I say I'm pro-life in the sense of seeing abortion as immoral and something that should be fighted

You should understand that the pro-choice side is not pro-abortion. I do not like abortions. I had the choice and i decided not to have one. I want women to have all the resources in the world so that they don't feel forced into an abortion. But taking away abortions does not solve the problems. If someone is going to want to abort their child they aren't going to want to raise them. We already have so many children in foster care that are neglected. They have no sense of stability for their entire life and then when they reach the age of 18 they usually become homeless. A huge percentage of homeless people were children who aged out of foster care. If we take abortion away this problem becomes exponentially worse. We don't have the resources to take care of these children, to shelter them and feed them. No infant deserves to lay in a crib next to 8 other babies who were also abandoned in an understaffed and underfunded orphanage. Babies need near constant love and attention - I know this because I have a 5 month old. In my opinion, sometimes the most merciful thing to do is prevent an embryo from growing any further. I don't want any more children to be subjected to the foster care system and we currently have no plans or resources to fix it.

403,"The good thing about working at home in a computer is that I can engage in discussions like these and answer promptly, turning a regular internet discussion to something more dynamic.

&gt;  But I think abortion is just too unique of an issue to compare it to anything else. We can use such analogies in a pro-life conversation after we've equated abortion with murder and say then say murder is wrong and we already have laws in place to protect those who are born so why not the unborn. But it isn't black and white. There truly is no other scenario to which we can compare. 

I agree that abortion is a unique scenario in some ways, in fact, I also argued it on this thread I believe. Nevertheless, my argument of Nazi Germany and slavery, wasn't to be compared necessarily to abortion, but to the broader statement you made(or at least implied) that if a society chooses how to govern themselves, they have a say on morality, or even towards the minorities, even if that laws are democratic. Democratic laws do not equate to good or moral laws necessarily, just as authoritarian laws does not necessarily equate to bad or immoral laws. Of course, this is relevant to your argument and the discussion about abortion, but the uniqueness of abortion does not escape this, so I believe it's a false equivalence fallacy. If it can be said that abortion is so unique it escapes my counter argument about law and morality, I think it can also be said that it escapes your original argument of law and morality.

&gt; There are different laws in place for when a murder occurs in self defense, whether it be to prevent grievous bodily harm or just protect bodily autonomy

Yes, but self defense is moral because of reasons, rather than because society at large says it is. That's the key point. If self-defense were immoral, it wouldn't matter (for ethical discussions at least) whether most people want it or not. As it stands, self-defense is moral in certain cases and thus, as law tries to regulate morality, it's also made legal.
That's why I see value in the self-defense argument of abortion where it relates to life-threatening scenarios. Not because a larger group of people have decided(even sometimes from ignorant positions) they find it good or not, but because it's a logical, reasonable argument.

Morality stands above laws, and laws are how we humans try to achieve a moral society.

&gt; Also consider that the only 100% effective method of birth control is abstinence.

Tell that to Mother Mary ;)
Just kidding. You could even argue that abstinence(as practiced) is also not 100% effective as you could be raped for example, in spite of your best efforts. The world is chaotic and you can't always control things, but by and large they are in your control. I have no guarantee that if I walk through my door a piano won't fall upon me. Yet, coloquially speaking and for all intents and purposes, I'm certain it won't happen. If you use proper birth control you are guaranteed that you won't get pregnant.

&gt; So should humans stop having sex unless for the purpose of procreation?

Not at all, the risk is so low it's almost inexistent if you're responsible. The issue is, at least in the US, it's a matter of improper birth control and irresponsible sexuality. Driving cars is a serious thing, that's why there's a limit of age when you can start driving, and there's always the risk of crashing, but most people that drive responsibly won't get in a car crash, if for some reason you do crash into someone, you can't wiggle out of it. Abortion is a more special case in the sense that besides rape, the only one responsible for you getting pregnant or not, is yourself, so if you get pregnant it's because of your own actions. There are many people who argue that you shouldn't have sex outside of marriage, and while being married you can have sex like bunnies if you want, and if you have kids then you'll start a family. I see value in that, but of course, won't force that unto anyone else, not even me. So I state that if you want to have sex, be responsible for your own birth control, and if you get pregnant, you can't wiggle out of it, specially by **killing** another human being.

&gt; For example, some people do not believe that you can even use birth control because they believe that it is wrong to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting itself.

That's why I say I'm pro-life in the sense of seeing abortion as immoral and something that should be fighted, but I don't relate to the movement as it's mostly religious and I'm not a religious man myself. I see many of their arguments hypocritical and only stand with them in the value of human life and its defense.
I don't see sex only as valuable in marriage, so I don't think that sex outside of it should be punished or condemned. I see certain aspects of it which I agree, but at the end of the day, I engage in casual sex and have never condemned it(I'm very liberal when it comes to sexuality).
So, I understand their position, but don't agree on it, and I see hypocritical to be against abortion while at the same time being against contraception. I don't see it particularly effective as we're sexual beings since around age 13 and the natural inclinations towards sex only increase in time, that's why most people lose their virginity at 16 or so.
The morning after pill? I'm not very familiar with it, but as far as I understand it it's not contraceptive but abortive, so the logically consistent position for me to take is to be against it too
Yes I would be against that pill too, because an embryo is still a human being, just not in the developmental stages where it's deemed a 'fetus'. But for this discussion when I mean fetus I mean the unborn human being regardless of its developmental stage.",1,1493234431,2017-04-26 15:20:31

406,"You make good points about Nazi Germany and what the law should be. But I think abortion is just too unique of an issue to compare it to anything else. We can use such analogies in a pro-life conversation after we've equated abortion with murder and say then say murder is wrong and we already have laws in place to protect those who are born so why not the unborn. But it isn't black and white. There truly is no other scenario to which we can compare. Even if we equate abortion with murder I don't think we can end the conversation there. There are different laws in place for when a murder occurs in self defense, whether it be to prevent grievous bodily harm or just protect bodily autonomy. Murder isn't so cut and dry in these scenarios. We recognize as a society that sometimes it is necessary to protect yourself and your body even at the cost of another individual. 

And to be fair, as I said to you that abortion is unique I know that my analogy is not completely on par because there is the question of whether consenting to sex is also consenting to pregnancy even if you've taken measures to protect against that. But the fact remains that pregnancy is an invasion of ones body. Fetuses work in the same way that parasites do (I feel weird saying that having had a child of my own) but biologically it is true. A woman's body is never the same after having carried a child and giving birth. There are many complications, many life threatening things that can go wrong even in a healthy pregnancy.

Also consider that the only 100% effective method of birth control is abstinence. No pill, or condom, or serialization procedure lowers your risk of pregnancy to absolute 0. With exception of having reproductive organs completely removed. So should humans stop having sex unless for the purpose of procreation? Should a husband and wife who do not want another child, nor can afford one not be intimate with each other? Where do we draw the line? Are there any types of ""abortion"" that you feel are okay? For example, some people do not believe that you can even use birth control because they believe that it is wrong to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting itself. Would you allow the morning after pill? What about a pill that would stop the mother from producing enough progesterone to allow the embryo to turn into a fetus?",2,1493232436,2017-04-26 14:47:16

408,"&gt; I don't agree that abortion is immoral. I made that clear in my first post. But i understand why you feel that it is and I respect your opinion. I can also very well understand why you feel the way you do because for most of my life i was anti-abortion.

I'm grateful for your understanding on my position and try to grasp pro-choicer's position and to also understand where they are coming from even though I maybe believe in most cases they are wrong.

&gt; With that being said, lets talk about whether abortion should be legal.

I think before getting to the legal status we should first reach a conclusion on the morality of it. Law should reflect morality, so it's integral for it. An immoral law is a law that should not be followed. An act that's unlawful but moral should be carried on even if it infringes upon the law.

&gt;  But some people don't follow that same pattern of thinking. Some people do not equate abortion with murder. Some people do, but believe that the mothers life and choice comes first. There are many different lines of thinking for pro-choicers. You can argue that they are wrong but you cannot change the fact that most of the population is pro-choice (in the USA).

There is a difference of opinion even between both movements, but there's a reality. Is abortion wrong or isn't it? You could have an opinion upon it but above opinions there's the truth of things. Who decides truth? That's difficult, but what you can do is justify your position with reason, compare the ideas and see what position remains standing, not based on popularity but upon reason. Many people have had different ideas upon why objects fall, for example, but there's an objective truth of why do objects fall. Same thing with morality, someone might believe that raping is a moral thing, others might not, but with reason we can come closer the truth of it. It's not enough to say 'this is my opinion', your opinion should be justified.

It's true that on by and large the Law, at least in concept, should be determined by the people. Yet this spawns another interesting debate that it's relevant but let's not go there in order not to extend this already lengthy exchange of ideas. Jews were condemned in Nazi Germany, Hitler was appointed democratically, and the laws were also democratic. The nazi germans had law at their side when they were rounding up jews, but had they Justice on their side?
There have been nations that have benefited from the slave trade, where the majority agreed upon it, but nevertheless it was an immoral thing.
If what's best for a nation is to declare war on their innocent, smaller neighbor and take their resources, does that make it a 'good' thing to do?
If the US as a population decided that it was OK, for example, to burn black people, would it be enough to say 'this is what we as population have decided' to justify it ethically?
All of these cases are unethical, even if they are democratic or popular.

&gt; Certain religious texts say abortion is immoral but we have separation of church and state

I'm not really arguing that abortion is wrong because of religion.

&gt; We make laws based on the moral code of the majority population and the majority population wants access to abortions. That is the difference between abortion, kidnapping and rape.

I agree that's how it is. I state that system is incomplete and allows for unfairness. I refer back to Nazi Germany. The rounding up of jews was lawful, and it was done as democratically as the abortion laws, yet, we can say that rounding up jews was a disgusting, immoral thing to do, regardless of whether it was a democratically chosen process.

About your veganism, if you believe that eating morals is extremely moral, then I'm with you, you should stand up against it, just as abolitionists stood up against slavers. It's not enough to say it's immoral but let's society keep at it. If you truly believe that eating meat is equal to murder or something like that, then I won't disparage you of telling that to me or fighting against it even if it goes against what's 'politically correct'. That's how we as a society evolve. Not all the time society is right, in fact, historically most of the time it did atrocious things, but we didn't as society reflect upon it unless people pointed that thing out.
Most people avoid these things out of a false notion of respect. If someone was beating up an old man in the street, you wouldn't 'respect' that person's ideas or behaviour, you would stop it, and that's the right thing to do.",1,1493227708,2017-04-26 13:28:28

We, as a population decide what we want the law to be. Most of us want abortion to be legal and so it is. 

Certain religious texts say abortion is immoral but we have separation of church and state. No higher being makes the laws, we are free to decide ourselves what is moral and immoral. I'm a vegan, I believe eating animals is extremely immoral. I would love for it to be illegal because I believe animal and human lives are equal and the ending of those lives should be carry the same consequences. But I'm a very small minority. It doesn't matter whether I'm right or not because the majority of the population here wants to eat meat and so they will not make laws which hinder that.

We should agree that first of all abortion is immoral. It's legal status is secondary to this. If we can agree on this then we have to address the legality issue(of whether it should be legal or not) by comparing it with other crimes.
You state that it should be legal because it doesn't prevent crime and it hurts the perpetrators.
So I compare it with other crimes, and ask if you honestly think they should be legal if it didn't prevent crime or hurt the perpertrators and I compare it with kidnapping or rape. I then ask if it were to be proven that making those acts illegal didn't prevent crime and carry inherent risks, should we then make them legal?

If you explicitly say that yes, then we can talk about the legality of abortion, otherwise it's not the main point. In case you explicitly say that yes, all other unsafe crimes should be made legal if they didn't reduce the number of crimes committed and that abortion is unethical, I will address the legality underneath.

&gt; The point is that making abortion legal is not going to stop women from having abortions

It doesn't make any sense at all that making something illegal would not stop at least certain number of women.  The issue is what's the rate? I don't think nobody can venture anything other than a conjecture. I believe we just don't have reliable data, so you can't really say it doesn't serve as a deterrent.

The only thing that comes to mind is the controversial 'War on Drugs'. Does legalizing drugs make society safer overall? There's the precedent for example during the Prohibition. But I believe there's a big difference between drugs and abortion. Many drugs aren't a morality/criminal problem, they're a personal or healthcare issue. Abortionists don't go around killing **other** people than unborn humans, contrary to for example Al Capone. If I smoke a joint in my house or take some MDMA with my girlfriend, there's not any real societal harm. Meanwhile a society killing its own offspring, murdering other humans sets a bad precedent, it's bad for society AND those other humans. That's the only scenario where a similar case could be made, but even that case is not that strong.

Then there's the weaker point of whether or not **should** we make it legal even if it can be proven that it doesn't serve as a deterrent. For this I bring that in legality issues a big element is precedent. Setting a precedent for the killing of human beings is not a good one. What is also the essence of the Law? What is it's reason of being? We can all agree that Justice and Law are good by their very nature and a case could be made that some things are bad. Depending on your own philosophy, we should not commit certain things to be done out of the inherent morality of those actions. It's a weaker and not as thought of argument, but for example, should we allow necrophilia? By most moral standards there's no victim, there's no big damage unto society, it's that person's right how to exercise his own sexuality, so if he decides to have sex let's say with the corpse of a dead girl without a family, what real argument can be given for its immorality? Yet I believe that there are certain acts that are immoral in of themselves. If I cheat on my girlfriend and she never finds out, I think that I still did wrong. It's just plain better to just say don't do it even if you can't grasp what's really immoral about it.",1,1493177580,2017-04-25 23:33:00
422,"It's hardly a paradox.  It just shows their lies for what they are.  If they really cared about keeping fetuses alive, they would support the policies that have been proven to reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions.  Contraception, more welfare, decreased social stigma, etc.  They do none of this and in fact consistently support the things that actually increase abortions.  This betrays their true motive- controlling and oppressing women.",5,1493176462,2017-04-25 23:14:22
423,"&gt;If it serves as deterrent for at least two abortions it's saving lives. How much of a deterrent does it have to be for it to be enforced by law?
You need to consider the second part of what I wrote. Some women may choose to carry to term but many more will find another way to have an abortion. I would predict that more lives would be lost because although more children would be born more women would undergo unsafe abortions where them and their fetus ended up dying. 

The point is that making abortion legal is not going to stop women from having abortions. I think when most people hear abortion they think of a D&amp;C where you need a sterile surgical environment, an OBGYN and recovery time. There are several other methods of abortion that are far more discreet. You need appropriate hormone levels to maintain a pregnancy and we have several drugs that throw these way off. Your going to have doctors giving abortion pills but also doctors prescribing other meds that are known to cause miscarriage. You aren't going to be able to prosecute a doctor whose prescribing medication for ""low testosterone"" or ""seizures"" even if he did it only so the women could miscarry. It just isn't feasible. We've seen several times in history that making something illegal does not diminish the demand for it to enough of a degree. Abortions will go underground and women will still have them. If you care at all for their well-being you will allow them to do it in a safe environment ",2,1493171889,2017-04-25 21:58:09
424,"&gt; I think we agree on this point but I don't agree that it is enough of a deterrent to save lives.

If it serves as deterrent for at least two abortions it's saving lives. How much of a deterrent does it have to be for it to be enforced by law?

The secrecy of a crime makes a crime harder to persecute, such is the issue for example with rape. Rape is a crime extremely hard to persecute because if the identity of the rapist is not known then you can't prosecute anybody, most victims don't come forward, and when they do it's near impossible to prove rape vs consensual sex. Does that mean that we should legalize rape? Those are two different things: the difficulties of prosecuting a crime vs the morality/legality of it.

You have precedents though, you have to look at countries that don't legalize abortion and see what's happening there. For example, my country's status on abortion is legal only in certain cases(or at least it was last time I checked), which means it's illegal in most cases(as the cases where it's legal are the extreme rarity). Yet, women don't get investigated when they miscarried, and as far as I know almost no one is charged with it other than doctors. Which is what I think would be the best route, as in most cases women won't go to such extreme lengths like hurting themselves for abortion, but rather will go to a clandestine doctor. If there's no clandestine doctor, her options are limited.

Even without the precedent is easy to see that crimes aren't usually prosecuted because the police body is not that big. You can see that with regular murder, the murders that are actually investigated properly aren't that much, most are just datafied into statistics and not investigated, and not all deaths are thought of as murders. Suicides/accidental deaths, etc... are recognized and usually not investigated as murders, same thing with natural miscarriages. Police may investigate doctors suspected of performing abortions and investigate them, which is far easier than investigating all possible pregnant women or women who have miscarried. If a scared, young woman can find a clandestine abortion doctor, surely professional undercover policewomen could too. But again that's besides the morality of it, and whether should the Law enforce itself on immoral acts against other people. Most of us would argue that is the essence itself of the Law. Just as you see it in other crimes. There's a parallelism between your reasons for difficulties in the prosecution of abortion and the difficulties in the prosecution of rape, alongside the risk of the act itself, and yet, nobody argues(rightly) for the legality of rape.",1,1493154297,2017-04-25 17:04:57
425,"&gt;If all things were equal and no abortion would be stopped by having it being illegal but women died in failed abortions, I would agree that yes, even though it's immoral, we should reduce the damage as much as possible.

I think we agree on this point but I don't agree that it is enough of a deterrent to save lives. You may have a small number of women that give up and carry to term but you will have many more women that seek abortion anyway and in that case, with an unsafe abortion it is much more likely that the mother will die as well.

Also, I understand why you think it should be illegal if you equate it with murder. But crimes are done in secret. A woman typically has an abortion at around 10-12 weeks. If she does not tell anyone of the pregnancy they usually will not be able to physically tell until closer to 18-20 weeks. How would anyone know that she or someone else performed an abortion? If abortion were made illegal it would really be more of a symbolic move to say that the government does not condone the action. I don't see any way in which we could prosecute or investigate these crimes. Surely you would have several cases in which a mother was investigated when she naturally miscarried. I could see this becoming an issue with mothers being stereotyped and more likely to be investigated if they were a POC, young or poor. So then you have women grieving over the loss of their child being accused of terminating that pregnancy forcefully. And the vast majority of women who seek abortion would not be caught ",2,1493146910,2017-04-25 15:01:50
426,"&gt; With exception to the math about birth control I agree with your points.

I think I have the math in one of these comments, I can look it up for you if you want. The facts around the birth control success rate are from a pro-choice side so they're not biased in favour of my point, and possibly biased against my point, but I accepted them because I believed them to be the standard neutral rate. The math I did is also logically valid, so if the method is valid and the facts are true then the conclusion should be equally true. I can deepen on this if you want.

&gt; Regardless of how you feel it is going to happen. So you can either outlaw it and have women and girls put themselves in grave danger or you can allow it safely.

I understand this point and it's one of the arguments that have kind of swayed me over to legalizing abortion because of certain statistics showing that the number of abortions are the same regardless of the legality of abortion. That didn't strike me as consistent with all other crimes(where penalizing them reduces to a certain extent the number of crimes commited) or even being common sense.
But I still need to research the data properly, as abortion statistics are unreliable, specially where it's illegal, so I think those statistics are just approximations without way of verifying them.

If abortion is equal to murder, should a a crime(for whatever reasons, understandable or not) be protected in that act by the law? I think not in those cases were the crime hurts other people, specially in the case of murder. Let's say bank robbers for example. Should we make bank robbery legal because doing it illegally carries certain risks(you can be shot) for the perpetrator? And that's a minor case because you could argue that 'safe' bank robbery does not hurt anyone except the bank(not a real person) in a very minor way, while abortion is more hurtful towards another human being. Does this mean that I want women to die or even punish them because of having abortions? Not at all, I just want them NOT to kill babies. If all things were equal and no abortion would be stopped by having it being illegal but women died in failed abortions, I would agree that yes, even though it's immoral, we should reduce the damage as much as possible. But as it stands I don't believe it is, and I do believe that making it illegal is consistent with what the Law intends to be and that it does serve as a deterrent to a certain extent.",1,1493145596,2017-04-25 14:39:56

Pro-choice women are not going to go through an unwanted pregnancy. You can shut down all the planned parenthoods and they will perform abortions at home. Doctors will perform abortions in secret. You can find ways to do it on the internet.

428,"Your response was a big appeal to emotion. I don't mean that in a bad way at all, in fact I agree that there should be an empathic/understanding emotional component in decision making. I actually in many instances value more the emotional argument other than the philosophical ones because philosophical ones that have appeared to be true in many cases have been the reason for many great tragedies, that could have been avoided if we were more empathic.

Nevertheless, you would also have to consider, what requires more 'humanity', whether conceding points you don't believe in to make someone feel better OR refusing to take another human life? If we're making the humanity argument I think most people - certainly most I know - see the act of taking a human life as more inhumane, and even those who don't still have that empathic connection(even though diminished) but it's overridden by their ideology. Most women with 'big hearts' that I know would give their own lives for their children. Not saying that all people who commit abortion are selfish, because many may be good persons and have good intentions, but ultimately they are choosing to kill another human being out of their own convenience and that's a selfish act.

Does 'giving up her dreams'-you could argue that it's more of a postponing than an actual giving up- justify murder? Believe me I do have sympathy for people in bad scenarios, which as far as I know usually aren't because of that scenario but rather because relationship problems. If they have a strong relationship with their partner they can overcome those problems, but many don't. I understand that position not just from the mother's perspective as many friends have been in that scenario, but also from the father's perspective(something not previously talked in this discussion). What most do, what's natural/humane/empathic to do is not to say 'well, this puts me in a bad position, let's kill it', but rather 'well this sucks' and make the best out of it. Not only do I have sympathy for the mother, I also have sympathy for the human being killed by those who should protect them. I try as hard as I can to not be judgemental against people, and for the large part I succeed, I don't judge murderers, rapists, etc.. in the sense of condemning them, but I do say that what they're doing is wrong and should be stopped. Even if someone murdered because he needed the money, or because the person they murdered is going to rat them to the police of a serious crime, or because they are a conflicted person. I have empathy for them to an above average level if I may say so... but that still doesn't justify it and doesn't mean they are correct or that they should be allowed to commit those things. Abortion is not any different. I can understand for example, a mother having birthed a baby who reminds her of her rapist. Thinking she would be strong enough to raise her baby, but upon seeing her baby for the first time, looking into his eyes seeing her rapist. I understand that, and can feel for her, but in no way does that justify leaving that baby to die, or actively killing the baby, no matter how bad she feels.


Yes, birth control fails, although I've done the formula and with proper birth control 3 out of 10,000 women will get pregnant over a whole decade even if they have the normal numbers of sexual partners. Birth control fails for example, when you use a condom irresponsibly. Vasectomy can fail, although very rarely, and I do understand those positions, where it might be tragic, but it still doesn't justify the killing of another human being. The majority of abortion cases aren't because of those statistical outliers in birth control but out of improper use/responsibility of birth control.

Suffering is not the only element of morality. Is an important one of course, a major one, but not the only one. If I were to see a homeless woman that was drunk wasted unconscious, can I rape her and kill her? She after all would not suffer- she's unconscious-, nobody else would suffer-nobody would miss her-. Does that mean that I am not commiting a serious immoral act?

To be honest, I doubt most of the times in abortion cases the mother is thinking about the baby, what's best for the baby, but rather she's thinking about the seriousness of her own situation, what's more convenient for her, what's the easiest way out of her situation. Those are all good things when they don't involve other people, less of all killing another human being",2,1493093017,2017-04-25 00:03:37
429,"&gt; Who is mandated to give blood or bone marrow? Ever?

Not sure what you mean by this.

&gt; Is it possible that you don't understand how central a uterus is to a woman's body?

I do understand this, but unfortunately you didn't understand my point, so let me clarify it.
Obviously I understand the woman is giving to the fetus, but what I actually said is that she doesn't have an choice in the matter, contrary to deciding to give an organ to another person she's not directly responsible for, she can't decide to NOT give her own blood supply.
Remember what I said about pregnancy being a very special scenario, that it's not like any other? So the comparison is not deciding giving an organ(or blood) to another human being-although I would argue against the morality of disconnecting your supply if for some magic reason you were responsible for another human being's critical condition from which they will recover and which you know if you disconnect they will surely die- but rather about forcibly killing that human being, do you understand the difference?

&gt; And it is impossible to be passive in relation to one's own body

Sure it's possible, you don't take an active part in several of your bodily processes.

&gt; Is eating an active thing or is refusing to eat more active?
Refusing to eat is more active than for example simply not eating because your body hasn't given you any hunger signals, and eating is an active thing, kind of like sex for example. Not sure what's your point.

&gt; Is falling active or passive?

If someone pushes you it's an active part on their side, while your falling is passive, if you're jumping for example it's active, although I still don't understand what your point is as there's obviously an active/passive component in these scenarios. Falling because of inertia and jumping have different modes(active/passive) depending on the context.

&gt; People must decide with their bodies, what types/how much risk to expose them to, how much care to give them and how to prioritize that care. They literally cannot walk away from their bodies to let them do their own thing. It's nonsensical to suggest that a woman is required to remain a passive bystander in her own body.

I don't disagree with you, I completely agree that bodily autonomy/integrity are important issues and we have a right. What I'm arguing is that those rights aren't absolute, like all other rights. The context matters and there are and should be restrictions on bodily autonomy/integrity, and the killing of another human being should be one of those restrictions.

430,"Who is mandated to give blood or bone marrow?  Ever?  

Is it possible that you don't understand how central a uterus is to a woman's body?  Is it possible that you don't understand that pregnancy changes impact nearly every bodily system: respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular?  Pregnancy involves giving the fetus unfettered access to the woman's arterial blood supply, causing permanent autoimmune changes, and reduction in bone density. Even a woman's hair growth and shoe size are impacted by pregnancy.

The two main types of abortion involve either scraping the lining of the uterus or causing the lining to shed, separating the fetus from the uterus. It is absolutely akin to stopping nourishment. If the fetus were able to live without the uterus, it would. But the uterus belongs to the woman. The blood and in the woman's arteries and calcium in her bones are hers. 

And it is impossible to be passive in relation to one's own body. Is eating an active thing or is refusing to eat more active? Is falling active or passive? Urinating?  Breathing? Taking medicine?  Staying in bed all day? Leaving your house and going to work? Is running from a predator active or passive?

433,"The reasons you gave of why bodily autonomy is important they all have to do strictly with movement and what it enables you to do, rather than of the body itself. If you can't move/speak then the reasons you gave of why it's important are nullified. That means that its importance is not intrinsic to the body itself but rather to the functionality it gives you.

I'm still not sure why bodily integrity is so important and how it ties exactly to the abortion debate. You can get to choose not to give your organs away because if you do you die in most cases(except a few of them) and you can't get them back. Donating is an active choice outward in your part, while your body nourishing a fetus is an internal process in which your body isn't asking for your choice and you can't stop doing it. What abortions does is kill the baby rather than you stopping the nourishment of it. They are distinct cases so aren't really equivalent.

Furthermore I'm asking for more clarification about the bodily autonomy right. It's clear that restriction of movement can be limited, but the movement of the body being an integral part of the bodily autonomy right, how then do you justify the permission of that restriction of movement? My previous example still applies, autonomy of my body also implies autonomy of its bodily functions, that is to say, if I wish to pee in a tree, I can, and if you influence with that you're restricting my autonomy. That is clear when speaking of its autonomy, so if there's something that I'm missing or you have a reason of why that restriction of autonomy is correct(or at least not really an infringement of the right of bodily autonomy). Also because many women pro-abortion equate it to the right for example of sex, and while is true that the right to sex with whoever you want-or to be more exact, the right to choose your sexual partners and your sexual activity as you see fit- belongs to the right of bodily autonomy, it's clear that right is not absolute. If that's not what you mean by bodily autonomy too, then within that movement there's a confusion of terms.",1,1493072614,2017-04-24 18:23:34
434,"I understand your argument and I agree with you on a few points. The issue it that far too often, discussions about abortions become very philosophical. We debate, is the fetus alive? Does a fetus have the same rights as a human that has been born? Does the mothers choice overrule all of this? But I encourage you to take a step back and really think about how these decisions and resulting policies affect real women. We are debating over one of the hardest choices a woman may make in her lifetime. Even if a woman knows that an abortion is what she really wants it's a traumatic experience to realize that you are pregnant when you didn't want to be. An abortion is an invasive procedure that can carry many risks. It isn't something a woman does on a whim or takes lightly. Sometimes it's the only thing that allows her to want to keep living. 

Imagine a 20 year old girl, on her third year old college preparing for med-school discovers she is pregnant. Do you want her to give up on her dreams? Do you look that girl in the eye and tell her to face the consequences of having sex with the guy she has been dating since 8th grade? Do you feel empathy as she sits in front of her guidance counselor and watches all her hard work go down the drain and she changes her life plan? Do you hold her hand and give her a shoulder to cry on when she sees photos of her peers getting accepted into grad school while she sits at home completing two community college classes at a time because that is all she can possibly afford now? Is this the life she should have to accept because her birth control pill failed?

Put yourself in the shoes of a mother with of two wonderful children she carefully planned for who discovers she is pregnant a third time. Her and her husband are in no position to take care of another child, financially or emotionally. He got a vasectomy but sometimes these things happen anyway. They don't qualify for assistance, so will you pay her bills? Will you comfort her when her marriage is falling apart because her husband is working every hour he possibly can and she feels so alone? She's under a crushing amount of stress and she can't afford to eat properly so she doesn't produce enough breastmilk. Her baby is constantly crying and her two small children feel neglected. Will you be able to make it better? Will you help the children who watched their parents go from happy and full of life to broken and angry?

I understand why you hold the opinion that you do. In a perfect world we wouldn't have unintended pregnancies but we do. We have pregnancies that are not at all the result of carelessness. Birth control fails and when it does the best we can do is go the route that causes the least suffering. Sometimes, that is abortion.",1,1493072287,2017-04-24 18:18:07

457,"I'm not sure what you're meaning by bodily autonomy. Maybe we should start with that, because what you seem to be portraying is more into bodily integrity, which some people say it's the same concept, so it would be a good thing if you can define that bodily autonomy and what it entails.

For example, does sex and masturbation, peeing, etc...(bodily functions/needs/wants) are covered in that bodily autonomy/integrity of yours?
I also don't have clear why you're lumping the self-defense scenario into the bodily autonomy/integrity. Maybe that will be clearer if you define it.
Also, the fact that I can't sell myself in slavery is not in and of itself an argument against bodily argument/integrity? The government is telling me what I can do or not do with myself.

Besides that, you make a good case for bodily integrity on a legal basis in your country and while it's important to the conversation, the main issue I'm talking about it's the morality/rationality rather than the legality of things.
The primary scenarios you mentioned have to do with the donation of your own organs, and I agree that it's important for us to have a decision on it, but I see abortion having some key differences and why the justification is enough, important and relevant.
But before doing that I think important to say that there are certain scenarios you mentioned where there are things that are legal but its morality is dubious. For example, in case of death the non-donation of organs seems to me immoral, even though it's legal, as it doesn't actually infringe on anyone's rights as that person is dead.

I would also believe the morality for not donating to someone who needs it, when there's no fatal risk for you. But here's another key difference: passive obligation vs active obligation, and by the way, this is relevant also to the legality issue. There's a difference between loitering not being allowed vs forcing the citizens to pick any piece of trash in the street. There's a difference between actively killing a fetus and not giving an organ to a fetus for example.
There's also a difference between the responsibility of the parents vs a stranger.

Pregnancy is a special case unlike any other I can think of, because of the natural bodily dependence of the fetus, so I can't think of any similar case but it's not important, let's say an hypothetical.
If for some reason I provoke a scenario where my son needs me to donate blood for him once or he will die. Is it immoral for me to refuse it on the basis that I don't really want to stop eating for some hours(a requirement for donation)? At the very least there's a clear distinction between this scenario and me having to donate to everyone. Not only morally but also legally.

It's clear that autonomy is more important than bodily autonomy. Autonomy of actions, the freedom it provides is more valuable than the bodily one, and the bodily one arises from the value of autonomy of decisions. Yet, if for some reason I were stuck in a winter storm in a cabin with a toddler and I knew that in a few weeks the storm would be gone and the parents would come for the baby, am I morally obliged to not let the toddler die? Isn't the case stronger if I were the cause of the toddler being in that scenario? Both autonomy or bodily autonomy are important, but neither are absolute.

461,"DNA is an acid you utterly insipid retard.

IT HAS NO ""HUMAN"" PROPERTIES IN AND OF ITSELF. PERIOD.

Therefore your ""muh dna"" argument is completely predicated on the presupposition that one sequence of DNA (x) is distinguishable from other strands of DNA (not x) to an extent that you can classify x DNA as possessing some sort of intrinsic special metaphysical attribute in such a way so as to justify asserting that therefore x is special.

Your argument sucks, you're appealing to ""human"" DNA when you actually mean to appeal to the human genome, and your logic is terrible.

Theres no singling out one set of DNA from other sets of DNA as significantly different to an extent that you can derive some sort of intrinsic (moral) value to it in the absence of an extrinsic objective metric to compare it too. Humans share 50% of their genome with a banana and something like 98% of their genome with chimpanzees and other apes. You're basically arguing in circles using the color grey to prove that other shades of grey are not grey because your grey  is the only grey. It's fundamentally absurd. The only reason you're able to categorize and classify things as being one color or another is by contrasting it against other colors and you have yet to articulate the procedure by which you categorize grey things as well as the metric by which you have conceptualized the color grey instead parroting ad nauseum that ""grey is grey due to grey being grey"" sufficiently defines what grey is and what grey is not and that ""if it is grey then it is grey"" stands as a legitimate argument in defense of the assertion that ""x is grey therefore x is grey."" It's redundant to the point of infuriation.

You can't choose to have sex and claim to retain bodily autonomy at the same time.

You can't engage in that activity and than pretend you have the right to 'withdraw' your consent to that life at any time during pregnancy. Your argument is purely emotional. Prolifers are fighting to restrict women. Couldn't possibly because abortion kills a human being.

466,"Despite your protestations, is not standard in the US/western society to consider bodily autonomy to be secondary to right to life. Examples:

- You can be sentenced to death with due process, but you cannot be sentenced to medical experimentation, organ donation, or even blood donation; these are considered cruel and unusual punishments. 

- There is no legal precedent for forcing someone to relinquish use of their organs for any reason at all. If you stab someone in the kidney, you can be punished for stabbing them, but not forced to give them yours.

- All forms of body donation are fully voluntary. There is no legal requirement to donate blood or bone marrow, even though these are life-saving donations with relatively small physical consequence for most people. 

- You (and your next of kin) retain control over your remains after your death, even if donating them would save lives, or in the case of medical research, many lives. 

- Killing people in self defense is considered permissible, and not considered murder.

- You cannot choose to sell yourself into slavery, even if that money were to be used for a life-saving medication for you or a family member. 

- Even if you consent to organ donation or medical experimentation, these are not enforceable contracts, even if someone's life is at risk. You can back out at any time up until the organ is removed from your body. You do not need to finish medical trials you start. 

Saying that bodily autonomy is secondary to right to life flies in the face of legal precedent regarding the use of one's body and organs.

This is because civilized society depends on us treating individual bodily autonomy as sacrosanct. If we don't, people could be subject to rank utilitarianism, where the government decides that your organs would do more good with someone else. A truly terrifying thought. Bodily autonomy also allows us to preference the intact, already functioning body over the more precariously situated recipient and gives people freedom to use their bodies fully to pursue varied life choices, rather than having their lives forcible disrupted whenever someone needs a bone marrow transplant. It allows us to plan for our future, determine our own level of risk, assign our own understanding of purpose to our bodies and lives.  It gives a vehicle through which to be a moral actors, as all of us has something that is fully ours, that can be kept, given or sacrificed at our own will, according to our own priorities. It acknowledges that if any of us are to have any self-determination whatsoever, we must be the captains of our own bodies. 

It also acknowledges the fundamental drive that people have toward bodily autonomy. Even people who are willing to die for a cause or another person retain their belief in themselves as moral actors who set their own purpose and conditions for the sacrifice that they make.  They embrace the choice that they make without relinquishing the right to make the choice. ",2,1492600050,2017-04-19 07:07:30

No I’m not. Dummy. I am saying that the word human is not a metaphysical property. It is just a word to communicate the properties that make up human dna. Nothing more or less.

&gt;DNA is a substance. It's literally just an acid. If you had a collection of vials of various strands of unlabeled DNA and you had to sort them out or categorize them according to the organism they come from, you wouldn't be able to without conceptualizing the referential organism first.

Yes you would. You would just use the object itself as a reference.

&gt;What you are basically doing is analogous to asserting that ""water is wet"" and then when asked how you differentiate water from other wet liquids you merely state that ""other wet liquids (that aren't water) aren't water.""

No it’s not. I am saying water is H20. I am saying other wet liquids have a different biological makeup no matter what you call them. And no matter what you call water. Water is H20.

&gt;BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! No, dumbass. I have other priorities beyond talking to a profoundly retarded individuals such as yourself.

Sure. One of them should be to take a biology and physics class.

&gt;Yawn. Not an argument.

Actually it is an argument. It’s what you fail to understand and address because it doesn’t fit in with your preconceived ideas. You’ll need to address this in order for what you’re saying to make any sense. Here it is again,

“Of course you can. You are mixing up semantics with physics. I don't think you understand that we do not establish the essential properties that distinguish the two. Those properties already exist in physical reality.
We merely classify them and attach names/words.
Allow that to sink in. The physical properties are already there. Independent of us.

Therefore, you can know that the strawberry dna and the apple dna are different without attributing either to one word or the other.”

&gt;Wrong. This is a fallacy. All you can determine is that one set of DNA is different from the other. You can't determine which object is the Apple shipped strawberry and which object is the strawberry flavored apple because there's no aesthetic difference between the two.

If the definition of strawberry flavoured apple and apple are equal to the makeup of the dna (which is what I’ve been saying all along) then yes you can.

***

&gt; Do you have any ideas why there is not a a universal belief that abortion is wrong, as we do with murder or incest

I can't really say with expertise as each nation's ideology is different. But I do believe it falls down into each nation's ideology. Similar ideologies produce similar cases. For example, in my knowledge, in certain periods largely infanticide wasn't deemed wrong(up until a certain age), while now we largely(I wouldn't use universally) see it as wrong.

It's interesting you mention incest. Consensual incest between two adults is not condemned, although it's hard to pinpoint what's wrong with it. The main case against it are people born with deformities but you can argue against it, and well, if that woman believes abortion is not wrong, they would just abort it. Yet there are very strong feelings against it.

Another example would be for example necrophilia. I think it's universally(I believe it applies to this case, or at least, almost universally) heavily condemned. Yet, if a person is dead, why is it so heavily condemned. It's because both incest(even if it's consensual) and necrophilia provoke disgust in us. It's not our moral sense of 'right' or 'wrong' but rather our gut saying 'wtf', I believe. But that's also affected by ideology as in certain cultures throughout time incest has been permitted.

Another useful case is cannibalism. We all disprove of it in the modern world, but there have been(and I believe there still are) societies where it's accepted. It has to do with ideas. In those cultures an immoral thing is permitted, even though on by and large it's condemned by the rest of societies.

Murder for example hasn't been universally believed to be wrong. Maybe you mean wrong within those members of society, but that lends credence to the whole 'moral relativism' and 'tribalism'. If killing another human being is wrong, it shouldn't be limited by whether or not that human being is a member of your 'tribe'. But it was, so it shows that the belief in murder wasn't based on morality but rather in something else. Globally there are several instances in the last century that show that no, humanity doesn't think it's universally wrong to commit murder. I submit that abortion is another one of these cases.

Why is there not a universal belief that abortion is wrong, contrary to murder, incest, etc.. Well I believe I've shown a few reasons(ideology, disgust) for the disparity between these cases. But it's also interesting you mention murder, because the word 'murder' is a legal term. If I killed a black man when slaves were property, it wasn't in most cases 'murder', although it was a killing that was wrong. I agree that like 'baby', we can use the word 'murder' for the 'wrongful killing of another human being'. Therefore it's interesting, because the only think that separates a killing from another killing is the 'wrongness' of those cases. Pro-abortionists believe there's no wrongness in killing that human being. I believe there is. The default of killing is that it's wrong, and for it to be permissible there needs to be a **strong**, valid justification. For example self-defense. The justification for pro-abortionists ultimately falls down into it's not a 'real' person. Is that the justification you use when you deem abortion not a wrongful killing of another human being?",1,1492276601,2017-04-15 13:16:41

So the killing of a human being needs no justification?
I think we can both agree that killing human beings is immoral, but yet, permitted in certain scenarios. And yes, you do need a justification on those scenarios, and the justification needs to be valid.

498,"&gt;Technically speaking, a majority of women get abortions before the 9-10 week mark, and before that time period the fetus is gender less. 

Well, to be more accurate most abortion take place by 12 weeks.
See graph [here](http://www.liveaction.org/news/factchecking-the-the-claim-that-fetuses-arent-people/). And the sex of a human being is determined by chromosomes and are present at the moment of fertilization. Sex organs are visible by 6-7 weeks. 

But check out the development of a fetus/preborn child [here](http://www.ehd.org/resources_bpd_illustrated.php?page=8). Sexual organs are already present by 6-7 weeks. Pretty cool.

2.  People can give their children up for adoption in lieu of feeding them. 

3.  In situations that are resource constrained enough that people are not *able* to surrender their children, infant death from malnutrition is not criminalized, but simply treated as a tragedy and the parents are presumed to have done their best with the resources they had. 

4. People *require* bodily autonomy because they cannot avoid making (sometimes very hard) choices regarding how to best spend their resources (of which their body is one).  How to approach infant feeding is another.

Remind them that the majority of women who abort are already mothers, and have responsibilities to other children, they may have responsibilities to their country/religion, etc.  Here, you have to demonstrate that bodily autonomy is not a luxury borne out of selfishness (often the narrative pro-lifers are starting with) but a necessity for any person who must make difficult moral decisions. 

I tend to find that pro-lifers have impoverished imaginations with regards to the situations that pregnant women may find themselves in. Because they can't imagine the varied situations, they can't respond empathically. This also drives ""the only moral abortion is my abortion"" effect because they can see their own need for autonomy more clearly when it hasn't been oversimplified.

9,"&gt; In the worst cases, yes. But mostly I just want to lock up pretend physicians that kill babies.

Why do you limit it only to the worse? What makes one bad but others okay? As you said, it is always murder. At the very least, shouldn't even taking a plan B pill put a women in for accompanist to murder? 

&gt;Obviously yes. If not technically murder in negligent cases then certainly some severe case of negligent homicide.

You do realize _nobody_ will see the imaginary children you are conjuring (in order to be a self-righteous, morally lazy dick) because _they are imaginary_? Even if a pregnancy were to be viable, your little mental masturbations will not be what is born. So you can shelve those.

You do realize your view includes getting weird at women for ""killing"" imaginary children _who could never exist in any form of real-world equivalent counterpart_ had the pregnancy continued because one of the dozens of unviable (and some including death of the woman) outcomes would have been the result?

12,"Passing through a vagina makes a child sentient? I was under the impression that didn't come until later once it's learned there are things beyond basic survival instincts.

Also wasn't aware that passing through a vagina started the nervous system allowing the child to feel pain. Perhaps you mean interpret pain? In that case you're looking for about 25 weeks of development, that's when the brain is meaningfully active and not simply ""under construction."" Although there is no real way to tell when it's able to actually interpret pain being as it occurs before the child is able to communicate. Therefore I posit that we must proceed under the assumption that it can interpret pain as early as the biological systems are in place to do so.

Why does completing a gestational period matter? What impact does completing a phase of development have on the validity of your personhood? I assume you have completed your childhood. Are you more worthy of the title of ""Person"" for having done so? Does that mean you are less worthy than the elderly?

I will agree with you that technology has afforded humans the ability to completely stop the direct reliance on the mother's bodily resources for nourishment at the point of birth. However without 24 hour care that infant will die rather rapidly so it's certainly no where near self sustaining at the point of birth.

The only way your sperm comment makes any logical sense what so ever (outside of humor specifically because of it's absurdity) is if you were going to use it for artificial insemination. Also if you wanted to be scientifically accurate about it you'd need to say ""half of my future baby girl,"" because you're goo on its own cannot become a person. It can *only* lay there and die where as a combined sperm and egg will become a human barring complications or the deliberate acts of people to stop it.

Now I will not at all disagree with you that rabid pro-life people can spew bullshit with the best of them, but so can rabid pro-choice people. Neither tend to care about or be particularly well versed in the science of fetal development, and both are just as callus about the points that matter most to the other side.

Saying this man is foolish to grieve the loss of what he viewed as his child from an objective point of view is pointless, callus, and stupid. All emotions are subjective and therefore irrational. So if you're going to judge him for attaching his emotions to that fetus, you should also judge yourself just as harshly for attaching your emotions to whatever it is you attach yours to.

Edit: You've edited your post while I was writing a response, allow me to clarify my position to your edited points. 

I agree that the completion of the gestational period is important, I just don't see why it's an important criteria for *caring* about it. Particularly when it's quite clear that both parent's cared deeply about it long before it was born.

You also raised the real crux of the pro-life vs pro-choice argument. The argument over which is the more fundamental right, the mother's right to bodily autonomy or the fetus' right to live. Ultimately I'm in the pro-choice camp specifically because of this argument. I don't agree that the mother has the right to abortion all the way up to labor. If she want's to induce early, ok fine but that is not the same as an abortion. My feeling is that around the 25 week mark abortion (specifically the termination of the fetus' life) should be illegal (barring complications that endanger the mother's life) because the brain has become active. That means on some level that fetus is now developing it's personality and has the ability live outside the womb which makes it as worthy of protected life status as an infant.

With all the above said I take huge issue with the pervasive pro-choice stance that the ""glob of cells"" isn't worthy of love, being cherished, or grieved by parent's who wanted it. In this particular case, even by your own most significant criteria of being birthed the child in this image was a person who lived a 10 minute life.",1,1490347276,2017-03-24 05:21:16
13,"It's sentient, one. It can feel pain, two. It's disconnected from the mother and has completed its gestational period, three. You can say ""it can feel pain at X weeks though"" - that's not the argument here, this is about the mass of cells that dude was holding. And even then, we don't know if the pain it feels can even be remembered or experienced consciously. So my second point is specious, yet, intuitively the fact that it's outside the mother and now no longer in gestation is an important factor. 

I could have also wanted my sperm to be a ""future baby girl"" and took a picture of a petri dish with my sperm in it. It may sound ridiculous, but the logic is there, and that's what scary about fundamentalist pro-life bullshit that's peddled around the internet. 

Stupid non-science people are given platforms where they don't deserve one. even if i grant you that it's a living breathing being that can remember and feel pain, i still don't think that means the mother doesn't have the right to evacuate it from her body at any moments notice up until the moment it's out of the vagina. she is not a prisoner. she has rights and she can and should assert them whenever she needs to.

Actually the flu presents a much, much higher risk of death. Also, the risk of transmission is very high when in close quarters. You obviously do not understand what RO and attack rate mean. Sorry but I just don't think you aren't being intellectually honest. 

&gt; If you were trapped on a plane with someone with some kind of super flu that took at least 6 weeks for everyone to recover from with 100% transmission and for some reason you weren't allowed to ask them to cover their face with a mask or shirt sleeve, etc and weren't allowed to go to a different seat and they weren't allowed to go sit in the bathroom or something and the airline said ""You either have to kill him or deal with it, we're not turning around or landing early"" then yes, I think you would legally have a right to kill them if necessary to defend yourself. See how outrageous this scenario has to become to be anything like pregnancy?

I don't see it. I know that you have decided that pregnancy is more risky than the flu and that it is ok to force people to take that risk (even though the risk of death is much higher than if pregnant) but haven't given any statistics that confirm this. I have however, shown that this is not the case. Either way, you are being inconsistent by saying that in one case we will force you to take the risk and in the next case we won't. It just seems like you don't care about the facts.
 
&gt; Again, we have to make it a super flu with 100% transmission, 100% chance of making you so ill you need 6 weeks or more to recover (during which you can't even drive), no chance of anyone else caring for the child, and no masks or pieces of fabric to make into masks are available.

Trust me, a mask won't protect you from the flu while caring for a child. And can't drive? What? You have obviously never been pregnant and have some serious fear mongering going on in your head. Have you ever had the flu or been pregnant?

&gt; And many women get 12 weeks or even longer. 6 weeks is the absolute minimum that every mom needs, medically speaking.

And many people have LIFELONG complications for the flu. I don't see how this is any different. Sorry but it just seems like you are grasping at straws here. 

&gt; Yes, some​ threats are so small that no force is warranted*.

Well, I don't think was a direct answer to my question. But ok. Than I guess you will have to set up some parameters. When for example, statistically speaking is the risk of death small enough for a person to be forced to take it?

Both of which go to transmissibility.

Your plane scenario is a bad analogy because you AREN'T stuck.  So it's not like pregnancy.  Also it's unlike pregnancy because the risks are lower.  

&gt;First of all, tons of people end up with long term problems from the flu that render them sick for longer than 6 weeks. The flu can lead to chronic fatigue, additional infections, pneumonia and worsen asthma, diabetes and heart conditions. It can lead to seizures, stroke, encephalitis and DEATH.

Sorry. You'll have to elaborate. I'm not sure exactly what you are saying here?

&gt;I counter your accusatory question with one of my own: do you want both hypothetical conjoined twins to die?

Nope. This was the scenario I had posed originally. Are you referring to this? If so, no one is at any significant risk of death.

&gt;Imagine a scenario where conjoined twins will detach naturally in 7-9 months. Doctors say with their help the separation would most likely happen successfully and safely. One twin suddenly develops a condition rendering her dependent on the other twin for 6 of those months. The healthy twin decides he does not want to wait for the 6-9 months. He wants to separate immediately despite the fact that the other twin will die as a result. I don't think anyone in their right mind would say he has a right to detach. I don't see how this scenario differs at all from abortion.

59,"&gt;Do you have evidence to suggest it's higher than 30-60%?

Yes. The flu is highly contagious. Your link does not say that there is a 30-60% of getting it if you are sitting beside someone. It only gives an [RO](http://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#Overview1) and [attack rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_rate). 

It also clearly states that if you are in close quarters (short distances) with poor air circulation (which a plane clearly has) your chances are high.

&gt;""However, transmission may occur at shorter distances through inhalation of small-particle aerosols (droplet nuclei), particularly in shared air spaces with poor air circulation.""

&gt;""In the absence of appropriate ventilation and air exchange, airborne transmission may play a greater role, such as in a crowded space where air exchange is limited."" 

&gt;Getting off an airplane affects everyone on the plane and costs a lot of money. If it only affected you and the sick guy there would be absolutely no reason not to stop the plane to let you get off.

I think there'd be plenty of reason and you'd be stuck until the plane could land safely. So either way you'd be forced to stay on and not kill him. However, I think you are missing the point. Not sure if you are doing it on purpose. But the point of the plane scenario is to mimic the fact that you are stuck. There is no way out. In order to make it analogous to pregnancy.

Use a different scenario if it makes it easier for you. A parent is stuck in a cabin with their newborn. The newborn is coughing. The parent is scared that he might get the flu. Can he kill the child or leave her out in the cold to die?

&gt;How many people have to be home sick with the flu for 6 weeks or more? Is it less than 100%? If so, you're wrong.

First of all, tons of people end up with long term problems from the flu that render them sick for longer than 6 weeks. The flu can lead to chronic fatigue, additional infections, pneumonia and worsen asthma, diabetes and heart conditions. It can lead to seizures, stroke, encephalitis and DEATH.

Again, all these things are besides the point. I asked in my last response, “Just to be clear, I am hearing that your argument is that if the risk to your health is small enough you can be forced to NOT kill the person posing the threat but, if it passes a threshold you can. Is this correct?”

Take extra steps to manage your fertility (get on a LARC, have your local Planned Parenthood give you an extra Plan B pill to stock in your medicine cabinet, etc) and do what's within your power to get politically involved (donate resources, time, or money to PP or other whole women's health clinics; vote in midterms; shop at businesses that support or donate to causes like NARAL or PP) and your anxiety will go down because you know you're doing everything in your power to fight against this fascist Cheeto.",11,1489757575,2017-03-17 09:32:55

That's exactly what pregnancy is, and you seem pretty Keen on forcing people through that.

&gt; As in there is a very real, identifiable and imminent health risk.

Pregnancy is a real and identifiable health risk.

Letting women's health deteriorate until there is an emergency before letting them abort will kill people.

&gt;  while a parent can not be forced to donate a kidney (not considered a regular need), the state does force parents to do things like feed, clothe, shelter, hydrate etc. (considered regular need)... I mean parenting can be risky too but we still can not kill our children to avoid it

The state does not force you to do those things. You can opt out of parenthood by giving the kids up for adoption. The only way to avoid pregnancy risks, once you're pregnant, is abortion.

&gt; There is a difference between positive rights and negative rights. The latter involves obliging action. The former involves obliging inaction. So for example, the state can not force you to give the fetus use of your uterus (that would be a positive right). But at the same time you can not steal her uterus (that is because the fetus has the negative right to not be stolen from).

This is exactly what I've been saying. Right to not be killed does not equate to right to force someone else to keep you alive.",1,1489697068,2017-03-16 16:44:28
109,"I will concede that it usually takes time to recoup from pregnancy. Not necessarily 6 weeks though and definitely not 100% chance. I've given birth. After my second child I was up and walking half an hour after giving birth. But I think this is a moot point anyway. 

I think that the chances of getting the flu are very high if you are sitting right next to someone or even in the same plane as them since the air recirculates. So I don't see changing seats as a viable option. Obviously there is no getting off the plane once you are airborne so that won't work.

It's an ethical exercise anyway. The point is, to imagine a situation that is analogous to pregnancy (and there aren't many real life ones, conjoined twins might come close) and see if you'd apply the same moral principals in those like circumstances.

Personally, I don't think you would. I could be wrong. But I don't think killing another human being to exercise bodily autonomy is justifiable in most or any situation other than serious harm or risk of death.

110,"&gt; There are people dying right now because they need a kidney. You could donate one to a stranger, at a risk of death of only 0.03%. You've stated here that choosing not to use one's body to keep another human alive is murder. 

Really? Where did I say that? I never used the word murder this whole time. Nor did I say one should be legally compelled to use their body to keep another person alive.

I feel like you aren't being intellectually honest if you need to keep putting words in my mouth to make a point.

&gt;You cannot consistently see yourself as anything but a murderer when you decide donating a kidney is too inconvenient for you to bother with.

I don't think the kidney analogy is analogous to abortion. Which has been my point all along. There is a difference between positive rights and negative rights. The latter involves obliging action. The former involves obliging inaction. So for example, the state can not force you to give the starving man a piece of your bread (that would be a positive right). But at the same time you can not steal his last loaf (that is because the man has the negative right to not be stolen from).

In the same way, we can not force a parent to donate a kidney to their child (that would be a positive right). But we CAN force the parent to not kill their child (the child has a negative right to NOT be killed).

However, children also have additional positive rights under parental responsibility law or duty of care. That is to have their basic needs meet, to be feed, hydrated and sheltered, by their parents. So while a parent can not be forced to donate a kidney (not considered a regular need), the state does force parents to do things like feed, clothe, shelter, hydrate etc. (considered regular need).

This is really key to understanding the prolife position. We can agree to disagree but, I think it is still important to actually understand where the other person is coming from. Not just assume.  
 
&gt; In a legal system where abotion is permitted on health grounds, all abortions are legal. This is the system in my country. It works well, as anyone who wants an abortion can get one.

I am thinking more along the lines of self defense. As in there is a very real, identifiable and imminent health risk.

111,"&gt;  Just as a note, you keep referencing legality, legal obligations, and legal precedents. That's not the point of my hypotheticals. 

Pro-choice is a legal opinion.  It means that it should be a legal right for a woman to choose based on her own ethics.  So, I'm willing to talk about *my* ethics and morals, but that has no influence on what I think should be legally permitted.

&gt;That's important for my first question, as to the definition of reasonable force. I'm not asking for a legal definition of the term (so no lawyers required). I'm asking for what you meant, exactly, by the term when you used it originally. 

I meant it as a legal term- self defense is a legal right.  It's a defense to support a not-guilty plea.  




&gt; an immoral action, because you don't know whether the man presents a threat, or if killing him is necessary. 

I assumed he was calmly walking toward me, as in he doesn't stop until he gets to me.  If I am helpless and restrained, presumably by the person walking towards me with a knife, how else would you expect that to be perceived except a threat?  At what point would you decide it's definitely a threat and it's ok to press the button?

&gt;He could be lying, of course, but pressing the button ""just in case,"" would, I think, be immoral (though of course, it would be entirely prudent to keep your finger on the button just in case!)

Sure, it's reasonable to wait and see if he's a threat or not.

&gt; It would seem immoral to kill someone who you know is not going to kill you, but on the other hand, it seems completely unreasonable that you would therefore have to submit to him. I'd have to think about this one more.

You don't know how badly he'll hurt you, he could plan on torturing you.  Even if it's ""just"" a little stab, that's pain and suffering that I think you should ethically be allowed to defend yourself from.  Also I REALLY don't think there would be an scenario where I trusted a stranger who was going to hurt me with a knife to do it just enough that I could fully recover.  Even when kinksters do consensual knife play, it's edge play because it's risky and easy to make a mistake.  And they're not doing any stabbing.

&gt; I think that it would be immoral to press the button. The man will die anyway, but not by your hand. It would seem immoral to directly kill an innocent person, even to save your own life. 

If he's going to die in either scenario, why is it unethical to save your own life?  You're doing it under duress, it's not like you're freely choosing it.

&gt; you're directly killing an innocent, with the added factor that he would not otherwise be in danger.

Again, it's under duress.  If someone dies either way, someone's life is more valuable.  It's icky and I'm not sure what I would do, but I don't know that I would feel obligated to die to keep someone else alive.  For all I know he could be a pedophile or something right?  I know that I'm a good person with lots to offer the world.  It seems ethically neutral to me I think.

&gt; A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will break your legs in a few minutes, and then release you and provide medical care; unless, of course, you press the button.
&gt; I would say that it is immoral to press the button. 

Yes I would feel like it was unethical to press the button in this scenario.

&gt;I'm trying to isolate the concept of innocence here: the morality of killing someone who, while they may be threatening you, are doing so through no fault of their own.

Well in your scenarios the stranger isn't threatening me at all.  They're an innocent bystander, whereas the fetus is an innocent threatening party.  To go back to the lifeguard example.  They're not intentionally threatening you by drowning.  There's nothing that makes them responsible for grabbing for you- it's a natural response in the panic of drowning.  That said, it's perfectly reasonable to save yourself even at the cost of their life.  They are certainly a threat, intentional or not.",1,1489635655,2017-03-15 23:40:55

114,"Just want to say first of all, thanks for responding. My hypotheticals and scenarios were a legitimate thought experiment, where I'm not sure of what I believe in all the cases, so I do appreciate responses. These were all moral hypothetical dilemmas that I came up with on the fly, more or less. The aim is to apply moral standards or reasons to a hypothetical situation, to see if they seem to stand up to scrutiny. That's why, for example, in my hypotheticals, there's a lot of unrealistic factors. I restrain you and give you only one way of interacting to isolate the concept of lethal force in self-defense from everything else, so that we can test how far that moral right seems to extend.

Just as a note, you keep referencing legality, legal obligations, and legal precedents. That's not the point of my hypotheticals. I'm asking if it would be *morally justifiable* to take certain actions in these scenarios, not legal. Also, I'm asking for reasoning as to why or why not. I would be very confident in betting that nothing similar to these scenarios have ever happened in real life; at least, I hope not! The goal is to isolate certain elements in a moral dilemma and test our reasoning and application of moral standards. That's important for my first question, as to the definition of reasonable force. I'm not asking for a legal definition of the term (so no lawyers required). I'm asking for what you meant, exactly, by the term when you used it originally. Looking back over it, I see that you were indeed speaking in terms of legality. So I've admittedly changed the subject: instead of asking if it's *legal* to take some action, let's see if it's *moral* to take some action. So, starting from the axiom that, all other things being equal, it's moral to act in self-defense when threatened by another, let me give my answers to my own hypotheticals:

&gt;The man is advancing towards you with a knife, stating that he is going to kill you.

I don't think there's much question here. You reasonably believe that you are in imminent danger of your life, from this man who will directly kill you, and you have no other means of removing the threat to your life. So, you defend yourself by killing the man who is directly threatening you in order to save your life.

&gt;The man is silently but calmly advancing towards you with a knife.

This is harder. I would think, morally speaking, you would not be justified in pressing the button. Understandable, certainly. But an immoral action, because you don't know whether the man presents a threat, or if killing him is necessary. Without further information, I don't think it's moral to preemptively kill a man because he has the means and opportunity to kill, without knowing that he has the intent.

&gt;The man is calmly advancing towards you, stating that he plans to cut the rope and free you.

I think it would be immoral to press the button in this case. Again, the man has the means and opportunity to kill you, but you have reason to believe he will help you. He could be lying, of course, but pressing the button ""just in case,"" would, I think, be immoral (though of course, it would be entirely prudent to keep your finger on the button just in case!)

&gt;The man is advancing towards you, stating his intention to physically assault and injure you. However, he will not kill you, will release you afterwards, and will ensure you receive medical care and make a full recovery after the attack. For the purposes of this hypothetical, you believe him.

This one I'm not sure I have an answer for. It would seem immoral to kill someone who you know is not going to kill you, but on the other hand, it seems completely unreasonable that you would therefore have to submit to him. I'd have to think about this one more.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker, stating that he will kill both of you in a few minutes, unless you press the button and kill the man in the room with you.

I think that it would be immoral to press the button. The man will die anyway, but not by your hand. It would seem immoral to directly kill an innocent person, even to save your own life. Again, it would be understandable if you did press the button, but I would argue immoral.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will kill just you in a few minutes and release the other man, unless you press the button.

I think this is clearly immoral if you press the button. There's the same consideration, in that you're directly killing an innocent, with the added factor that he would not otherwise be in danger. So you're valuing your own life more than his. Understandable, but immoral to press the button.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will break your legs in a few minutes, and then release you and provide medical care; unless, of course, you press the button.

I would say that it is immoral to press the button. Same considerations as the previous scenario, but you aren't even doing it to save your own life.

&gt;With your last three examples, they are completely unlike pregnancy because it is the fetus causing the risk/injury to the mother.

I wouldn't say that they're *completely* unlike pregnancy/abortion. I added them in to isolate a different factor. In the first set, the man in the room was the real or possible direct threat, an agent responsible for his own actions. However, in the second one, the man in the room with you was a helpless victim of the circumstances, just as you were. He didn't place himself in the room, nor are his conscious or deliberate actions threatening you. However, as seen in the first and second hypothetical of the second set, his continued life is threatening you. I'm trying to isolate the concept of innocence here: the morality of killing someone who, while they may be threatening you, are doing so through no fault of their own.",1,1489613705,2017-03-15 17:35:05
115,"I meant can a parent shift a child back to non-existence ethically as an infant, child, adult.

116,"Yes, I think that's a fair summation.

&gt;  Is it a reactionary force in proportion to the threatening force? Is it the lower of two choices: proportional force, or the minimum force available to you? 

I'm not a lawyer.  That said, here's my understanding of things.  You can defend yourself until the threat is neutralized.  If someone is trying to punch me and I'm able to restrain them on the ground, I can't then use self-defense as a justification to punch them.  However, as long as they are still a threat to me, I can escalate my use of force to protect myself.  If possible, I'm often obligated to retreat (though not in all states).  

In your scenario and in pregnancy, retreat is not an option and there's no ""restraining on the ground"" non-lethal use of force.

&gt;*The man is advancing towards you with a knife, stating that he is going to kill you. 

I think legally it would be very reasonable to assume your life was in danger and you should use force to protect yourself.

&gt;*The man is silently but calmly advancing towards you with a knife. 

Given that you are restrained and he is a stranger, I think most people would be afraid for their lives in this scenario as well.

&gt;*The man is calmly advancing towards you, stating that he plans to cut the rope and free you. 

Probably reasonable to be afraid and have your finger on the button, but I don't think it would legally hold up to shoot him.  Maybe, given that you are restrained (presumably by the man) and a stranger has a knife, it would be.  I doubt there's legal precedent for this.

&gt;*The man is advancing towards you, stating his intention to physically assault and injure you. However, he will not kill you, will release you afterwards, and will ensure you receive medical care and make a full recovery after the attack. For the purposes of this hypothetical, you believe him.

Yes, absolutely reasonable to defend yourself from injuries and pain and suffering using lethal force if necessary.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker, stating that he will kill both of you in a few minutes, unless you press the button and kill the man in the room with you. 

I think legally you would not be in trouble for pushing the button.  I doubt this specific scenario has occurred.  However, with lifeguards, they are obligated to try to save a drowning person.  However, if that person gets ahold of them and is putting them at risk, they are taught how to escape the hold, swim away to safety, and try to help again.  They are not legally obligated to put their own life at risk to save someone else's.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will kill just you in a few minutes and release the other man, unless you press the button. 

Again, I'm skeptical that there's legal precedent, but I think you are probably not legally obligated to die to save someone else.

&gt;A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will break your legs in a few minutes, and then release you and provide medical care; unless, of course, you press the button.

Hmmm, not sure on this one.  I can't think of an example where a person is legally obligated to endure non-lethal physical harm to save someone else's life.

With your last three examples, they are completely unlike pregnancy because it is the fetus causing the risk/injury to the mother.  If an outsider said ""Abort or I'll break your legs"" or ""Abort of I'll kill you"" it would be different, in my mind.  But ultimately I do think you'd be within your right to abort in those scenarios.  Granted that would be tragic for wanted pregnancies and absolutely illegal for the outsider to make those threats.",1,1489607786,2017-03-15 15:56:26
117,"There's a lot you gave in your response that I think is problematic. However, I'd like to focus on one part of it that genuinely made me think.

&gt;One necessity for self-defense is using reasonable force. In the case of pregnancy, the only way to prevent the injury your fetus will cause you is to abort. There's no other level of force with which you can defend yourself.

I'm going to try to abstract this, and then apply. Essentially, I think what you're saying here is twofold: When employing self-defense, you need to use reasonable force. Also, that force can be reasonable if you have no lower-force options available to you (in other words, even if an action wouldn't ordinarily be reasonable force, if at the moment it's the lowest force option, then it becomes reasonable due to the lack of other options short of submitting to the threat). Is that a fair summation of what you said?

Of course, we'd need to define reasonable force. Is it a reactionary force in proportion to the threatening force? Is it the lower of two choices: proportional force, or the minimum force available to you? Some other definition?

I'm trying to apply the principle in a hypothetical. Suppose you find yourself bound with rope in a chair, completely unable to move your arms or legs or stand up from chair. You can see, hear, and speak fine, but not move. The only movement you have is your index finger, which can press a single button on the chair's armrest. This button, you know, actuates a device that will instantly kill anyone in the room, except for someone sitting in the chair that you are on.

Now, suppose that there is a man in the room with you, and the following scenarios:

*The man is advancing towards you with a knife, stating that he is going to kill you.
*The man is silently but calmly advancing towards you with a knife.
*The man is calmly advancing towards you, stating that he plans to cut the rope and free you.
*The man is advancing towards you, stating his intention to physically assault and injure you. However, he will not kill you, will release you afterwards, and will ensure you receive medical care and make a full recovery after the attack. For the purposes of this hypothetical, you believe him.

Now, in which cases would you be morally justified in pressing the button, and why? Now imagine some different scenarios:

*A voice comes over the loudspeaker, stating that he will kill both of you in a few minutes, unless you press the button and kill the man in the room with you.
*A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will kill just you in a few minutes and release the other man, unless you press the button.
*A voice comes over the loudspeaker and states that he will break your legs in a few minutes, and then release you and provide medical care; unless, of course, you press the button.

If abortion is the only option to avoiding serious harm or death than I have already said the procedure should be an option.

If anyone else threatened to hurt you in a way that took 6 weeks to recover, you would absolutely be within your right to defend yourself.

One necessity for self-defense is using reasonable force.  In the case of pregnancy, the only way to prevent the injury your fetus will cause you is to abort.  There's no other level of force with which you can defend yourself.  

Therefore, every pregnant woman is absolutely legally entitled to defend herself from the bodily harm that is very likely to come from pregnancy and giving birth.",6,1489553962,2017-03-15 00:59:22

&gt;We all understand what forced-birthers believe, whether they are religious or not. They have lectured us many times, as you have done here.

&gt;By ""people like you"" I meant people who hold the positions you are presenting. 

Well you haven't ask me for my exact position so I think you are operating under false assumptions and prejudices.

&gt;As for laws in other countries, they are not relevant. Most of those countries are theocracies and I would never live in any of them, nor would I want a child of mine to live in one. 

I specifically said DEVELOPED or first world nations.

&gt;I only care about laws here. By the way, you might look up abortion rates in those countries. They are not different than here, except that some of them actually have higher rates. The only difference is that more women die, just as they did here before Roe v Wade. 

Actually, it's the exact opposite. Developed prolife nations actually have higher maternal rates and lower abortion rates. See [here] (http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrea-mrozek-if-abortion-saves-lives-whats-happening-in-chile), [here](http://www.liveactionnews.org/think-abortion-restrictions-increase-maternal-mortality-think-again/) and [here](http://liveactionnews.org/why-media-is-wrong-claiming-pro-life-laws-dot-work/).

It wasn’t an argument. It was just a comment pertaining to the discussion. My argument is and has always been that every living and human organism is equally valuable and deserve the same human rights. Particularly the right to life (the right to not be killed).

153,"&gt; You'd be wrong. Unless you're talking about very late term abortions, where the fetus is given an injection to stop the heart. In most countries, this is only legal in situations where the fetus is malformed or the mother's life is at risk.

The abortion pill is not always used for an abortion. There are other procedures such as D&amp;C, D&amp;E etc. which are also very common. That being said, I still don't believe the fetus dies because of underdeveloped lungs but rather being denied nutrients. He or she simply could not survive the whole process of evacuation. But this is moot point I think anyway.
 
&gt; I believe prosecutions for parental neglect are mostly wrong. Noone should ever be prosecuted for not doing something. 

Well at least you are consistent. So how do you feel about parental responsibility law?

&gt;However, the obligation placed on the father in your scenario is nowhere near as bad, as it doesn't increase his risk of death or injury like continuing a pregnancy does. 

Well, if I haven't already said it I am operating under the assumption that any prolife law would always make an exception for life/health of the mother.

&gt;A more similar situation would be a father choosing not to dive into a freezing lake to attempt to rescue a child that had fallen in.

I think this analogy is to extreme going the other way. If we allow for the above exception mentioned I don't see how it can be viewed like this at all.

Imagine in my scenario the father left his baby out in the cold because she seemed to think the baby might be developing a flu and he was afraid to catch it. Would that change the father's legal and moral obligation to his child?

158,"&gt; Yes, I do, and I think I did say that. You left out the part that abortion is not against the law. Your point was considered by better legal minds than mine when the court's ruling was made. 

Abortion is against the law in many other countries. In fact, it is restricted in most of the rest of the world actually. So I don't see how your point is relevant?

&gt;Contraception is not against the law. (Those on my side are not as stupid as the religious right thinks we are. We know that contraception, all contraception that works, that is, is next on their hit list. 

Actually you do not need to be religious or right winged to be prolife. Those things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, there are many [secular](http://www.secularprolife.org/abortion) prolifers. You also do not need to be opposed to contraception to be prolife. 

&gt;Your logic can be ratcheted all the way back to the ""every sperm is sacred"" song in Python's Meaning of Life. 

It is really important for you to understand that biologically the prolife position can never be used to defend the life of a sperm. An embryo and a sperm are very different from a biological standpoint. A sperm is not an organism for one thing and it belongs to it's hosts body (the male). This evident as it contains the same 23 chromosomes as him. This is why you will never see a prolifer holding a sign saying, save the sperm. Lol. If you are interested I can explain the biology further. Let me know. 

&gt;That's just an aside at this point, though, and not part of my current argument.) In practical terms, and this is just one point I know about personally, tests for older women (at greater risk for birth defects) do not come back until around 20 weeks. Now I know you and your friends are saint whatever and would be delighted to spend the rest of your life and your other kids' college money on raising a suffering child until its painful early death, but I, as an older mother, was glad to know tests and options were there. If abortion laws are tightened, I expect to see not only increased deaths from do-it-yourself abortions for usual reasons in younger women, but also career women in their thirties getting tubals or getting their husbands to get vasectomies to avoid the risk I have mentioned. 
This just seems like an emotional appeal.

I know that most prolifers would accept a law that allows for the exception of health/life of the mother and fetus anyway. 

That being said, there is always the option of adoption for mothers who can not raise children with special needs that are not life threatening.

&gt;Of course you won't know, because they won't talk about it, especially in front of people like you. 

I'm not sure how to take this comment? ""People like me""? I'm a stranger on the internet, you know nothing about me.

&gt;I had a perfectly normal pregnancy, by the way, but I do want the same rights and protections afforded to my grown offspring.

Well, glad to hear that your pregnancy went well. I just don't see your argument as very logical. It just seems riddled with emotional appeals.

I mean you would never argue that it is ok to kill a born special needs child. So, really the question is what's the moral difference between a born child and an unborn or pre born one?

Prolifers believe there is no morally significant difference. I think that prochoicers do think there is and that is the big issue of contention.  ",0,1489359812,2017-03-12 19:03:32

181,"&gt;but if I die you would likely be charged with some form of negligence resulting in death, or manslaughter. 

Not my main point, but even if you give the liver you'd still be in legal trouble.. the law doesn't care.

&gt;The anti choicers could argue that the fetus needing your organs would be no different than if you accidentally damaged my liver.

The difference is that the only two choices you have in life is to be alone forever or have sex (get married.. you can't have sex without marriage.. legally it could be annulled as it wasn't consummated..and even if so.. good luck finding a man who would go without sex.) So is this liver activity necessary for companionship? The real issue is the pro-lifer's view on sex..

256,"&gt; I don't agree with this. There are many animals that are conscious and yet we do not extend them the same rights as we do infants for example who haven't even yet reached there level of awareness.
&gt; Also, I still am not quite sure what is reasoning for objecting to the images? You say using animal imagery is fine because the animals are not affected but using the Syrian boy is not but, he also can not be harmed as he is dead. This is a little confusing.

What I'm saying is his family can be harmed by it. As far as the animal argument goes you may very well be right. Its hard for us to really know if an animal is sentient or if it is more akin to running a computer program. Depending on the animal, they usually lack lobes of the brain that we think may be essential for self actualization. The truth is we don't know that much about the brain and what specifically makes us conscious sentient beings, beyond the fact that we do need a functioning brain.

&gt; Surely animal lovers everywhere would say that they were caused great pain by there animal being abused.
&gt; I also think quite the opposite. It speaks to reason and logic. It forces one to examine the cognitive dissonance they are experiencing and try to rationalize the nonsense.

I'm certainly not arguing that abusing animals is ok. A birthed living animal does have a functioning brain (though we don't know to what extent), as does a human. A 9 week old fetus however does not. So there is a clear distinction between these cases.

You might be right in some cases to as far as how the image actually effects individuals. I will admit that for someone like me an image like that does encourage me towards a logical analysis of the situation. I'm not a good example though because nearly everything does that to me. It seems to me like most people respond emotionally.

Most people see the image and just think: oh how horrifying we have to do something. They don't put it into perspective, like by realizing that thousands of children die everyday for various reasons.

I also think it makes them less likely to accept, or even consider, an idea that would not involve helping that group of people, even though that could potentially be the most logical one.",1,1488296722,2017-02-28 10:45:22

258,"-﻿ Each year in the United States, more than 23,000 infants die before reaching their first birthday. 

-﻿ Though the mortality rate varies widely by state and county, the average in the United States is higher than in the rest of the world’s wealthy countries, worse than in Poland and Slovakia. 

- ﻿ White, educated American women lose their infants at rates similar to mothers in America’s peer countries. Most of the burden of the higher mortality rate here is borne by poorer, less-educated families, particularly those headed by unmarried or black women.

- ﻿ Across the United States, black infants die at a rate that’s more than twice as high as that of white infants.

- ﻿ Black women who received prenatal care starting in the first trimester were still losing children at higher rates than white women who never saw a doctor during their pregnancies.

- ﻿ Other researchers suggested that poverty and lack of education were to blame, as black women consistently experience higher poverty levels. Those factors matter, but they don’t account for the full racial gap. 

- After evaluating 46 different factors, alone and in combination—including smoking, employment status, and education—the authors of one 1997 study could account for less than 10 percent of the variation in birth weight between black and white babies.

- Another study found that even black women with advanced degrees—doctors, lawyers, MBAs—were more likely to lose infants than white women who hadn’t graduated from high school.

- ﻿ The research suggests that what happens outside a woman’s body—not just during the nine months of pregnancy—can profoundly affect the biology within. One study found that black women living in poorer neighborhoods were more likely to have low-birth-weight infants regardless of their own socioeconomic status. More segregated cities have greater black/white infant-mortality disparities; women whose babies are born severely underweight are more likely to report experiences of discrimination.

- ﻿ Health experts now think that stress throughout the span of a woman’s life can prompt biological changes that affect the health of her future children. 

- ﻿ Researchers now link much of that higher stress burden to racial discrimination. 

- ﻿ Personally mediated experiences include things like being treated differently at a doctor’s office than white patients; black women who report these kinds of experiences have been found more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. 

- Institutional discrimination—which refers to the ways in which unequal treatment has been baked into our social, economic, and political systems—impacts individual health too. 

- ﻿ In 2013, Krieger and her colleagues compared infant deaths in states with and without Jim Crow laws; they found that black infant deaths were significantly higher in Jim Crow states, but that after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the gap shrank and, by 1970, had disappeared (although the overall black/white gap persisted).
 
- ﻿ The state’s Republican leadership has only made things more difficult by cutting social support programs like food stamps. Last year, the state stripped hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from Milwaukee’s home-visiting program. Wisconsin Republicans have also fought efforts to increase the minimum wage, which could have a positive effect on the infant-mortality rate. A study released last year found that a $1 increase in the minimum wage in various states between 1980 and 2011 corresponded with a 1 to 2 percent decrease in low birth weight and a 4 percent decline in deaths of infants between 1 month and 1 year.",1,1488243860,2017-02-27 20:04:20

279,"http://leg.mt.gov/bills/2017/sb0299/SB0282_1.pdf

It's Senate Bill 282 (SB282), which I couldn't find in any of the articles about it.

I have problems with a lot of the new language, like its tendency to say ""unborn person.""  But looking past the precedent its choice of words sets, here is what it does:

1. Make abortions illegal after 24 weeks in Montana.  I'm not going to fight on that one.  24 weeks is the federal limit on how early an abortion can be illegal, and Montana wants to be a conservative state.  Take it up with the federal government.

2. Make it so that after 24 weeks a parent and medical team can't decide to withdraw care in the event of a preterm birth.  This one I'm also kind of okay with.  If you came in to labor and delivery and delivered at 32 weeks, you could not ask us to withdraw care.  Our pediatricians would take care of the preterm baby.  No objection.

3. But wait, it also redefines ""viable"" as after 24 weeks, editing out the old definition of ""able to survive outside of the [uterus].""  That means that it requires doctors to provide futile care for neonates born after 24 weeks with conditions incompatible with life, like renal agenesis.

4. It defines gestational age as the time elapsed since the last menstrual period.  This is a necessary line, because you need to differentiate gestational age from fertilization age, the time elapsed since fertilization.  In the Ideal Woman, this is two weeks.  Because many people have a different time between LMP and ovulation, if our first ultrasound shows a very different size of the embryo or fetus, we redate -- we generate a new date based on the estimated time since fertilization based on size, and then add two weeks because gestational age based on LMPs is standard.

5. It states that, if a pregnant person after viability (which, remember, is now 24 weeks after your last menstrual period, regardless of how your fetus is) has a condition that poses an ""immediate, serious risk of death or irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,"" the doctor *shall* induce delivery or deliver by cesarean.  I can't have a law that says I *shall* do a procedure -- only that I shall *offer* a procedure.

---

For each of those, you might say, ""well, if it ever went to trial the courts would use common sense.""  Maybe.  But put yourself in the physician's shoes.  It wouldn't be weird to have a situation that bridged some of these details.  Why should you have this risk on your mind?

The language of the law seems designed to evoke a botched abortion at 25 weeks resulting in a live-born neonate and a heartless abortionist leaving it to die in a steel pan somewhere.  Except for one D.C. madman, that doesn't happen.  Especially not in Montana, where there are no abortion providers after 24 weeks.

---

So here's how this law could affect you if you (or your patient) were pregnant:

- Prior to 24 weeks with a regular menstrual/ovulatory cycle: no effect.

- Prior to 24 weeks but your period is irregular: if your dating had to be corrected, this law contains no mechanism to allow for your new dating to be used.

- After 24 weeks with a devastating fetal anomaly: you cannot choose to provide comfort care only.

- After 24 weeks with a health condition and your doctor recommends preterm delivery at this time but you wish to decline preterm delivery due to the risks of extreme prematurity, i.e., you would rather risk death or permanent disability to get your baby one more week of gestation: there's no mechanism here by which a doctor can compel you to submit to induction or cesarean, but your doctor would be at risk of getting sued if something bad happened, because they did not induce you when this law says that they should.

- After 24 weeks, desiring a termination: doesn't matter, Montana doesn't have providers for after 24 weeks anyway.",1,1488076199,2017-02-25 21:29:59
280,"&gt; Well not if the line was drawn at fertilization :).

Y'know, I'm not sure that it would.  We (the left) have to fight for contraception, sex ed, and vibrators.  I think that the radical Christian theocrats among us would not choose to switch to feeding the poor, healing the sick, and welcoming strangers into their homes.  

&gt;I think if the line was drawn at 12 weeks (like in most parts of the world) then most people would accept it. Partially because most people are moved by emotion and after 12 weeks a fetus/preborn child looks very much like a more developed human beings in a more obvious way.  [etc., brainwaves]

I'm dubious about this as well.  There have been a lot of pushes for 20 week bans on ""fetal pain"" grounds (which, for the record, is not supported in scientific literature).  In each case, the groups behind it are actually really in favor of making abortion illegal; they've just given up on doing it all at once and are trying to do it incrementally.

But you make a slightly different argument -- that the hard-core theocrats wouldn't stop, sure, but they'd lose their popular support.  Now it becomes a debate about human nature, and I fall on the side that the evidence doesn't really matter for what people choose to decide, generally speaking.",3,1488074074,2017-02-25 20:54:34

284,"&gt; To view the fetus as morally equal I would have to have a reason to. With humans that have been born you can easily make the case that they are conscious. The reason we don't care how we treat machines and computers is because they are not.

I don't agree with this. There are many animals that are conscious and yet we do not extend them the same rights as we do infants for example who haven't even yet reached there level of awareness. 

Also, I still am not quite sure what is reasoning for objecting to the images? You say using animal imagery is fine because the animals are not affected but using the Syrian boy is not but, he also can not be harmed as he is dead. This is a little confusing.

&gt;Not only is it using an image that has caused real people serious pain, but it only speaks to emotion, not logic.

Surely animal lovers everywhere would say that they were caused great pain by there animal being abused. 

I also think quite the opposite. It speaks to reason and logic. It forces one to examine the cognitive dissonance they are experiencing and try to rationalize the nonsense.

285,"&gt;It's murder because it kills babies. Most people who have abortions - by a wide margin - are not considering it because they were raped, or because it was incest, or even because they are physically likely to be permanently harmed or killed by carrying the child to term.

I am so sorry for your loss. As a prolifer I can tell you that we are against elective abortions and not theraputic ones. Every prolifer I know makes exceptions in cases where the mother’s life is at risk.

&gt;You don't get to use marginal cases in reference to the whole. It sucks that this happened to your family, but you should be ashamed of trying to use this travesty as an argument against life, least of all because an appeal to emotion is a logical fallacy - you are attempting to manipulate the stupid by intellectual dishonesty. 

Your family was in a horrible and rare predicament and your wife choose to sacrifice herself for her son. She was brave and selfless and her actions are heroic.

&gt;Once again, I'm sorry for your loss, but it doesn't give you an excuse to promote death. And I hate to say it but if you had been intellectually honest in the first place, and been able to see the difference between what those protesters were progressing and your situation, your wife might be alive today.

I think that your wife made a choice to give up everything for her son. This was her decision and I don’t think there is anyone to blame. Mother’s often think about their children before themselves and she lost her life in order that her son would be saved. 

I would say that honouring her memory by giving your all to fatherhood would be heroic on your part now. In situations like these we tend to want to be angry and blame others but, the truth is that sometimes life sucks and you have to be strong.

&gt;anyone who voted for Trump is _____ (evil, hypocritical, hostile to or hateful of poor, minorities, etc, any other negative conclusion that you'd like to fill in the blank with)

What makes you say that?  It's a fact that he's the most explicitly racist candidate in a long time.  It's also a fact that republicans in general have a problem with racism.  Not that democrats are blameless, but it's not a ""both sides are equal"" situation.  I personally believe that anyone who could stomach a vote for Trump must be a little bit racist at least, but that is beside the point.  At the very least, they accepted his racism, which, as we've seen, kills infants (indirectly).

I didn't suggest a course of action, I was asking what the prolife response would be.  I have yet to hear anything.  Don't you think it's telling that so many people want to argue about if they're racist or not but not a single one has an idea about what to do to push back against this problem?  It says something about priorities, I believe.

&gt; it is reasonable to have an honest disagreement on the cause and solution.

Sure.  Show me where that has happened.  No one has pointed out any issues with the studies.  They've said racism doesn't exist, they've said this problem is unrelated to abortion.  Do you agree that racism exists?  Do you take issue with the studies cited in the article I posted?  That would be a disagreement about the cause.  And like I said, no one has offered any solution except, I suppose, my idea that republicans pressure their politicians to be less racist.  But, I'm happy to talk about other ideas or approaches.  That discussion has not happened.  Again, I question people's priorities.

&gt;There's no logical chain of arguments that I can make to connect your point to your conclusion that doesn't fail.

Ok, let me ask you some questions to help you here.  Why are you pro-life?  What is the importance of making abortion illegal, in your opinion?

&gt;substantiate it with facts

Fact: Trump supporters are more racist than other groups.

Fact: White Christians supported Trump by a huge margin.

Fact: Christians make up the majority of the pro-life movement.  

Sources posted previously, happy to post again if needed.

Maybe Republican politicians aren't listening to anyone, but in that case, why do they keep getting elected?  If Republicans really did take issue with racism, why wouldn't an anti-racist candidate have stood up to Trump and won?",1,1487968659,2017-02-24 15:37:39
288,"-I think it's likely that most prolife people voted for Trump. My issue with your use of that point in constructing an argument is twofold. 1, you've done no research or cited any sources to back up that claim; it's an assumption that reveals more about you than about reality. 2, you're making some kind of point by claiming that association exists. You don't make it directly or explicitly, but given the context of your post and other comments, it's an implicit accusation that anyone who voted for Trump is _____ (evil, hypocritical, hostile to or hateful of poor, minorities, etc, any other negative conclusion that you'd like to fill in the blank with). This is just close-minded political rhetoric. That kind of argumentation, due to the 2 issues with it that I've raised, has no place in reasoned argumentation and fact-finding. Now, I have to say this, because every time I do anything less than hate and denounce Trump, I'm accused of that most heinous of crimes, being a Trump supporter. I'll just state for the record that I did not vote for Trump, I think he's damaging to this country, his policies and actions as president are disastrous, I cannot stand his economic, trade, or immigration policies... however, I unabashedly applaud his prolife policies and stances. I do this while personally believing that he is not actually prolife, but merely using that issue to gain support.

-Yes, that article is a challenge for us, and we all should be doing what we can to lower infant mortality rates. However, an intelligent, good-intentioned person can reasonably disagree with the conclusions of you or the article, without being a terrible racist and hypocrite. If they grant the conclusions, then they can disagree with the best course of action to address it without being a terrible racist and hypocrite. If they agree with your conclusions *and* your suggested course of action, they can still decide that abortion is a far more pressing issue without being a terrible racist and hypocrite. Finally, even if every single person in the prolife person was a terrible racist and hypocrite, that does nothing to invalidate the actual arguments for the prolife position. There's no logical chain of arguments that I can make to connect your point to your conclusion that doesn't fail. You're not providing any evidence of your claims here. Your argumentation is to present some statistics and a conclusion from those statistics, and then immediately denounce anyone as a racist and hypocrite who does not fully endorse your interpretation of the cause of those statistics, and the best solution. This all goes back to the point I keep making: it is reasonable to have an honest disagreement on the cause and solution.

-""I also think that people who tend to be prolife tend to be culpable for more of the institutionalized racism that persists in the US, so I think they should especially feel motivated to address it."" This is merely your own prejudice and bias against prolife people, so unless and until you substantiate it with facts, it has no place in reasoned argumentation and debate centered around good intention and honesty.

Exactly.  Are these so-called ""pro-lifers"" going to admit that publicly?  I seriously doubt it.  

But it's obvious to me that they really don't like women being able to reject ""their traditional role"" (marriage, motherhood, and nothing else) by using contraception to prevent pregnancy.   So I think they will do whatever they can to restrict women's access to it.  That includes making it much more expensive for women to buy and/or refusing to sell it at all.

Without access, there is no choice.  And choice is precisely what ultra-right ""pro-lifers"" do not want women to have, no matter how many times they claim otherwise.",10,1487939242,2017-02-24 07:27:22

295,"No, I posted it here because I hoped that people in r/prolife would be particularly open to hearing about something that's killing infants.  It seemed like an audience that would be especially sensitive to this tragedy.  It also seemed like an audience with a lot of room for growth since it does not appear that pro-life people have many qualms about voting for racist politicians.  

I'm not saying pro-life people need to dedicate themselves to all pro-life issues- I'm not asking them to be against war or the death penalty, I'm not even asking them to be in favor of welfare.  I'm just asking for them to be consistently opposed to the death of fetuses/babies.  

I was under the impression that pro-life people care about infants.  I'm certain that most of them voted for Trump.  This article was new to me, I presumed new to most of the people here, and it gave me hope that there might be a way for prolife people to become allies and push back against racist politicians for the sake of babies.

296,"You know, I'm sure this will be ill-received by you, but looking at that post, the comments, and your post here, you are guilty of the same lack of logic and intellectual honesty that you perceive in pro-life advocates.
 
If you could diagram a flow chart of your line of reasoning in this issue, and why you made the post that you did in the subreddit you did, what would it look like? What was the point that you were trying to illustrate?
 
Allow me to state unequivocally that it is an absolute tragedy whenever a child dies. My heart truly does go out to any parent who suffers the loss of a child, and I mourn for those deaths.
 
Is that why you posted this article in the prolife subreddit? To express sadness, and be joined by others in that sadness? No. You did it to criticize and (hopefully) demonstrate the entire prolife position is actually hypocritical. You then react angrily and emotionally when, shockingly, members of that community defend their focus on abortion and the unborn.
 
Your rhetoric that anything less than a full-throated endorsements of the conclusions of institutional racism from statistical analysis about societal ills and problems, extrapolated from a variety of sources and methods and with a variety of variables is full-blown racism is hysterical, dishonest, and does not promote an open or honest dialogue. The effects, causes, extent, and best solutions of racism is something that good people of good intent can have honest disagreements on, without one side or the other being evil racists.
 
You're also guilty of a very dishonest tactic: defining the intent of the pro-life movement by their name, which is in reality a marketing term generated in response to the pro-choice group's own marketing label. In reality, these two groups came into being and are debating one issue: abortion. It would be better for both to call themselves and be referred to as pro-abortion and anti-abortion. However, prolife and prochoice are the popular terms, and that's what we have to deal with. It's juvenile and sophomoric to construct an argument by claiming that, if we call ourselves prolife, we have to have an equal devotion to a list of causes that could be marketed under the same term, and if we don't then we're hypocrites, therefore our position fails.
 
That argument is absurd on the face of it. However, what if we grant it? Let's assume that every single prolife advocate is a hypocrite if they don't devote an equal amount of time to other ""prolife"" issues as abortion. Let's go further. Let's say that they're all racists, bigots, evil hypocrites of the lowest sort, who are only interested in the arguments that they put forward because they further their secret agenda of persecuting women and minorities, or any other sinister agenda you care to ascribe them. *You still haven't actually addressed the arguments.* Hypocrites can be right, as can terrible people. I may be a terrible person, but if you don't address the actual arguments, then you're not addressing anything.

Now, let me go out on a dangerous limb here and submit for consideration that, perhaps, most prolife advocates are actually upset at the death of children, whether before or after birth. Ludicrous at first glance, I know, but let's grant it for just one moment. Could a person *reasonably* spend more time and energy on addressing the issue of abortion, and less time on addressing the infant mortality rate? Let's look at just a few facts. The article you posted stated that every year, approximately 23,000 babies die before their first year of life. That is truly terrible; I do not say that lightly. I meant what I said at the beginning of this. Every child's death is tragic. Now let's consider the number of abortions in a year. According to [the Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states), there were approximately 926,200 induced abortions in the United States. If someone has reached the conclusion that abortion ends the life of a living, human child with the right to life, which of these things would attract greater attention? Further, in general, which issue would seem more pressing? The deliberate and direct ending of innocent life, or indirect, not immediately attributable deaths that have a variety of causes, contributing factors, and possible solutions that may help or harm in various ways?",4,1487902375,2017-02-23 21:12:55

Brain waves are how we judge some one to be dead. Biologically an entity does not need to have brain waves to be considered alive.

Fair enough

&gt; Is that the biological definition? I'm trying to find proof of this but every definition I can find is pretty vague. It is a human organism, that's for sure. If it really is a medical fact then I'd have to adjust my argument a bit, but it seems that human being is more of a sociological term than it is a medical one. If there is hard evidence of this somewhere please show me because I'm happy to be proven wrong if I learn something.

Prolifers refer to living and human organisms or beings (being just means existence). That is, an embryo is living. An embryo is human. An embryo is an organism. And an embryo exists. These are all biological terms. Things that can be detected in physical reality and undeniablly an objective biological fact.

&gt;I've also found papers written by Doctors that go both ways. The ones that support it being called a human being are from religious universities.

Really? I'd like to see these. I am thinking your research is a bit bias. Not sure but it kind of sounds that way.

Here's what I always find. I have never found a credible biological source that says anything different than a distinct and living human organism begins to exist at fertilization.

&gt;&gt;Moore puts it even more plainly in Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology (7th edition, Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2008, p. 2):[The zygote], formed by the union of an oocyte and a sperm, is the beginning of a new human being.

&gt;&gt;Keith L. Moore’s The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology (7th edition, Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2003) states the following:A zygote [fertilized egg] is the beginning of a new human being. Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete … unites with a female gamete or oocyte … to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.

&gt;&gt;Development of the embryo begins at Stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote.""
[England, Marjorie A. Life Before Birth. 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31]

&gt;&gt;Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).""Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being."" [Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2]

A woman needs to be able to listen to her body and make decisions. I have a rare expression of an otherwise common genetic disorder. That rare expression makes it very dangerous for me to carry a pregnancy into the 2nd and 3rd trimester. (It is a cavernous malformation inside of my spinal cord, between C-3 and C-4)

But I wasn't diagnosed with this lifelong disorder until a year after having an abortion (at ~6-7 weeks.) 

I had the abortion because something felt really wrong. Every fiber of my being was telling me something was wrong. That's how I found out I was pregnant so early - I don't think I had even missed my period, but I went to the doctor because I felt awful.

Had I continued the pregnancy, there's a high liklihood I would be tetraplegic or dead now. But I'm not... because I was allowed to listen to my body and have an abortion. No doctor could have known. No politician for sure. Just me. I'm the only one who knew, or could have known, that something just wasn't right.

Turns out even that short period of pregnancy caused a small amount of permanent damage to my spinal cord. That's how I was eventually diagnosed. 

Now I'm a bit disabled, but I still have control of all my parts. I do have pain, neurospasticity, and heavy duty meds that control both.  Had it not taken 2 weeks and 2 separate appointments to get the abortion pill, I might not have that entirely life altering damage.

However, even sharing my experience far and wide, I've yet to change a single mind. I do live in Texas, so that doesn't help.

Most just say they support abortion when medically necessary, and completely skip the part where no one knew it was medically necessary. When I press that point, they say it's too unique of a situation to weigh it against the countless innocent lives being lost to abortion. 

Basically, my one life just doesn't stack up.

Edit: it's the same way as you can consent to sex, but you cannot demand sex because you aren't entitled to it and sex would violate someone else's bodily autonomy if they didn't grant consent. ",3,1487727073,2017-02-21 20:31:13

345,"&gt;I messaged a woman asking her what she thought of a story recently posted on here about a man who lost his wife in childbirth because they chose not to have an abortion despite knowing how dangerous her condition was (a choice which was very much influenced by aggressive protesters at planned parenthood pushing the idea that abortion is always murder). I simply asked the woman whether after reading that story she still felt that it is ""always"" murder.

I don't know anything about this women or your conversation. I can tell you though that as a person who identifies as prolife it is not a good start to bring up the rare situations that most of us make exceptions for. It kind of shows that you haven't really given any thought to our position and it can be frustrating for some. I'm not justifying what she did. I am just saying what could have been going through her mind.",1,1487725456,2017-02-21 20:04:16
346,"Hmm. See I've considered this and I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about it. The bodily autonomy issue is easy and doesn't really extend to amputations or assisted suicide so it really doesn't have a lot to do directly with abortion but it is to some degree similar as a ethical question.

Do I think assisted suicide should be allowed? Yes. It's pretty straight forward with someone who's suffering a terminal illness and would otherwise die a slow and painful death but with someone who isn't suffering a terminal illness I tentatively also say yes. If someone is mentally ill, or just wants to no longer be alive we should explore every possible solution to this problem first but if nothing works then they're obviously still suffering from the problem and I think should be allowed to make that choice. But an otherwise healthy individual who wishes to die would likely have the means of doing it themselves as well. In this case I think it would probably come down to the decision of the doctor but I also really can't say what other ethical issues that would present.

As for amputation, this is another one that gets a little weird. If they have a mental illness and all other solutions have failed, I guess it would make sense then to allow them to find someone who will do it. People that do have a mental illness that causes them to want an amputation will often hurt themselves in a desperate attempt to have their limb removed and at that point, that seems like a much bigger issue then just letting them cut the damn thing off. 

Transgender issues have already been mentioned, and it sort of feels similar to that. Transgender individuals tend to (but not always) want to undergo surgeries to change their bodies to better represent how they feel and I believe they should be able to. I know that they often still suffer from high rates of suicide even after undergoing gender reconstruction surgeries but I think more studies might need to be done about that before I can really be sure how much that has to do with being transgender as opposed to living closeted for so long or any other number of issues that might be related to that like not passing, transphobia, debt, lack of social support, etc.

I think for me, it comes down to the quality of life of the individual. If a person's quality of life is deeply effected by something like the desire for an amputation or untreatable suicidal tendencies or anything else I think we should do what we can to improve their quality of life or let them make the choice to end it. If the only way to improve their quality of life is to allow them to have a pointless amputation or plastic surgery or breast augmentation or sexual reassignment surgery or anything else then I think it's wrong of us to block them from doing that. If it's not a direct problem to their quality of life then make them pay out of pocket as the do with cosmetic surgeries, otherwise then I think it should be covered by medical insurance.

All that said, these are sort of speculative beliefs. I'm sure there are probably holes in my reasoning and I'm welcome to having them pointed out, there may be things I have quite considered or understand well enough that might make me seriously reconsider these ideas but for now that's as far as I've explored the topic.",1,1487725439,2017-02-21 20:03:59

There's a little variation in belief surrounding any possible exceptions (danger to health of mother, victims of rape, health of foetus), and that's about it. They think they're fighting against legalized murder. There's no room for discussion or compromise. Some believe in using contraceptives and others don't, but that's a fringe issue in the ""pro life"" camp.

Meanwhile the pro-choice side leaves the decision up to women and their healthcare providers, because pregnancy is a medical condition. There's willingness to compromise about a cut-off for the proceedure based on gestational age, except in cases of medically necessary abortions or rape.  The ""pro life"" movement has made it clear that they believe life begins at conception, and are not interested in compromising on gestational age.

He doesn't. It's intellectually dishonest to do so. Marginal cases should not be applied to the entirety of cases specifically because they are marginal. For example, Some people have heart conditions and should not ride the Rollercoaster. You do not have a heart condition. Should you therefore not ride the Rollercoaster? Another example: I have a basket full of jellybeans, all of them deadly poisonous except for ten (and lets make those ten exceptionally delicious for emphasis.) want one? 

&gt;or somehow thinks [this] (/And I hate to say it but if you had been intellectually honest in the first place, and been able to see the difference between what those protesters were progressing and your situation, your wife might be alive today.) is an appropriate response, is not worth engaging with.

By Op's own admission the protesters influenced the decision. Therefore, if he or his wife had understood the marginality and singularity of his wife's situation, the outcome may truly have been different. 

You're clearly mad that I'm right, and I do not care. 

Furthermore I don't see the point in being more personable about this situation anyway, since being as bereaved as he states he is contrasts with the lack of thought on the subject (I could reasonably expect it to be glanced over by people here, being that they aren't involved) and that contrast coupled with the obvious contradiction (she made her own choice Vs the protesters have blood on their hands) leaves very little doubt that, unless his actions are deeply shameful, he is lying. He is a troll. He is 'virtue signaling'.  Yet so many have drank his koolaid.

364,"Yes, but remember that consent is a two way street and doctors are also consenting to perform the procedure, for which they will be held legally and professionally accountable.

The medical system generally does a pretty good job of self regulation by requiring that the benefits outweigh the risks for any procedure performed. For example, a surgeon will expect to be prosecuted or struck off the medical board if they amputated a healthy limb simply at the request of a patient. And given that surgeries are team efforts, there are many opportunities for other team members to object if they doubt that the procedure is medically necessary.

As another example, in my city, abortion is still listed as a crime, however it is ""lawful"" if required to preserve the physical or mental health of the woman. There is no limit on the gestational age at which an abortion can be performed, yet I've never heard of anyone having an elective abortion on a healthy fetus in the third trimester but I have heard of many late term abortions being performed in hospitals where the woman's life is in danger, or where it is known that the fetus will not survive after birth.

Thus, how exactly would you draw the line with this? For instance, if one's brain literally doesn't match up with one's body and thus one wants to amputate a healthy limb of his or hers, should he or she be allowed to do this? Also, what about if a guy wants to get surgically castrated in order to, say, permanently reduce his sex drive?

In addition to this, off-topic, but I have another question for you--do you believe that a parent who forces his or her minor child to accept, say, a kidney transplant from him or her should be able to change his or her mind in regards to this later on and make his or her minor child get another surgery to retrieve his or her kidney (even at the cost of this child's death)?

371,"I think there's a good argument to be made that certain desires are the result of mental illness- that outside of very narrow circumstances (for example, terminal illness, extreme physical suffering), the desire to commit suicide originates from untreated mental illness, and as such, the first course of action should be to address and try to treat the underlying cause.  It's the same as you note in bringing up BIID; the question ends up being about whether we feel the desire is legitimate, or the result of a treatable mental state.

As such, I don't think it's particularly fair to compare those sort of extreme situations to abortion; not wanting to have children is not considered a psychiatric disorder.

(Although an interesting argument could be made not on the bodily autonomy argument but one of harm reduction, such as with the criminalization of abortion leading to maternal mortality/morbidity . . . if there were really a rash of BIID sufferers doing additional, unnecessary harm by attempting to self-amputate, would we consider allowing it?).

To address the discussion at hand, I feel very strongly that if we are to actually have reproductive choice, we must feel safe in making that choice.

The psychological warfare one faces when having even a medically necessary abortion is, to my mind, criminal. Women are forced to clinics which are typically specifically for abortion (rather than a regular, discreet, OB/GYN), are met with mentally unstable and vitriolic protesters, and then they have to comply with oppressive legislative constraints (in many states), all before they can have a medical proceedure.

Protesters should not be allowed within visual range of any medical facility, of any kind. As a legal matter, the presence of protesters is an agregious violation of patient privacy.

And pregnancy - even one that may harm or kill you - does things to a woman's brain/body that make us want to continue a pregnancy. We're biologically wired for babies. You were both very excited those first 11 weeks, before learning that complications could lead to fatality for child or mother. She was nearly into the second trimester, and flush with all of the hormones that keep us having children generation after generation. Biologically that's a difficult thing to overcome when faced with such a terrible choice, between a wanted child and one's own life.

Add to that the afformentioned psychological warfare, and I can certainly understand you feeling that there are ""pro life"" protesters with blood on their hands. 

I agree.

On a personal note, I suspect you're struggling to just get through each day.

And that's ok.

It's only been 5 months.  

Just hold it together as best you can. If you can find an in person support group, or even just a grief couselor or therapist, it might make the days a little easier. 

I know you've lost other family and are no stranger to grief. I hope the well meaning advice doesn't offend.

My absolute warmest wishes. Please feel free to PM anytime.

Edit: I reread the post (I am on my phone) and wanted to answer some of the questions you asked.

Paraphrasing:

&gt;Why is one choice morally superior to the other? 

It's not. That's why it's a choice. We need to foster as personal a choice as possible, because morality is personal. This is unlike any other life rights issue. The closest comparison I have, regarding social mores and laws, is that I'm not required to render aid to anyone. It is considered morally and legally acceptable to choose to step over a homeless veteran and his children on the street, choose whether or not to render aid in the event of an accident, choose whether or not to protect someone under physical attack, etc, **because** it is of potential risk to you. Pregnancy always comes with a level of risk, even in otherwise healthy individuals. Why in this one instance would women be morally or legally obligated to render aid? One could argue they created the person needing aid. I would counter that none of us chose to be women capable of reproducing, or chose to have sex drives, or have failure rates amongst every type of contraceptive available... and your wife certainly didn't choose to have a dangerous genetic disorder complicating a previously very much desired pregnancy.

&gt;What would you do?

I would have the abortion, and I wouldn't think of it as murder. I know this because I have a genetic disorder that makes pregnancy extremely risky, possibly resulting in tetraplegia or death. My mind is made up. I'm not trying to have children. That doesn't mean your wife made the wrong choice for her. She may have valued the potential of your childs life more than her own. She may have thought she'd rather take the risk, than mourn your son. I don't know. Again... it's just such a personal choice.

436,"&gt;No stupid, you CANNOT call a reptilian a ""human"" by your definition because they do not possess a ""human genome."" That's the whole goddamn point. 

Reread my comment. I specifically said if they possess human dna. I honestly do not know if you are being serious or not? How can you be this obtuse and then turn around and call me stupid. It’s actually quite funny.

&gt;You are only able to call a reptilian a ""human"" if you attribute ""humaness"" to some other universal property between genetically human entities and reptilians which are aesthetically indistinguishable from these genetic humans.

Says your opinion which I completely disagree with. If they are aesthetically indistinguishable but do not possess human dna then they are not human beings. Simples. I’m not sure why you can not follow such a simple train of thought.

&gt;Again, that's not how conceptualization and the universalization thereof works mate. Of course human DNA comes from a human being and apple DNA comes from an apple. The problem is you can't differentiate apple DNA from human DNA without referencing the object the DNA comes from. I'm asking you to tell me what that object is, because the object is not it's DNA. Do you get it now?

Yes you can. The object of reference is the physical properties of the dna itself. Do you get that?

&gt;Hey stupid, I'm parroting back your blatant sophistry. Whether or not anyone ""cares"" about whether or not the other accepts or rejects a certain proposition bears no effect on the truth of that proposition. Do you understand? 

Of course it doesn’t. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you this whole time. Finally something we agree on. As a side note, calling people names makes you look really ignorant and immature. You might want to consider that in your future conversations.

&gt;Humaness and/or humanity are neither defined by nor established by the ""human"" genome. The human genome is defined by the human entity it comes from (the human being) and the human being is the object used to establish the concept of humanness/humamity.

I don’t agree. Human is established by the human genome. The human genome is defined by the dna under analysis. And the object is the actual physical molecules that make up the strands. Do you get this now? You are talking about some weird philosophical shit that has no basis in ontological reality.

&gt;And do you think that that new species will be or not be called a ""human?"" None of the aesthetic properties change. The entity is indistinguishable from other ""humans"" of the past but with a ""significant"" genetic difference. The universalization of the ""human"" concept stays the same. So what do you call these creatures if not not ""human beings?"" Whether or not they have a different specieal name is a red herring.

Well this demonstrates that you know very little about dna. If there is a significant genetic difference than the aesthetic properties will inevitably change. That’s how animals evolve. 

&gt;I defined human beings as entities which exhibited personhood to illustrate a non-circular argument that refutes your innately circular definition of ""human."" 

My definition has never been circular and you never explicitly defined human beings once. What a waste of time. You are beyond dishonest in your rhetoric.

&gt;""Personhood"" is irrelevant unless you reject the presupposition that all human beings are people which tends to be one of the foundational premises of abortion prohibitionist ideology. 

I reject the notion that any distinct and living human organism is not worthy of personhood rights.

&gt;You're advancing the organismal apologetic which states that some sort of moral worth or moral value can be derived for certain entities by virtue of them possessing a specific genetic code and certain properties of life. This apologetic is absurd and not an argument.

Well first off, no I’m not. And secondly, just saying something is absurd doesn’t make it a truism. 

&gt;This isn't an ""opinion,"" stupid. I'm explaining to you the metaphysical nature of categorization. Entity X is not entity x because it has x genome. X genome is x genome because it comes from entity x. Define entity x.

And I don’t agree. In this case, Entity X IS human because it has human genes. Period. As I said, if you are more interested in talking about personhood you should just stick to that topic and stop parading all this other nonsense around. Human is a biological term not a philosophical one. You should stick to the term person if you want to discuss philosophy. 

You should probably be asking, why I think all distinct and living human organisms qualify as persons instead of talking about fucking candy rings and shit.
 
&gt;Lmao, you have the audacity to accuse me of being obstuse while simultaneously making an appeal to ""human DNA"" as though a distinction could be made in this context? Good lord you're dumb.

The pot calling the kettle black. You really need to work on your reasoning skills. You should ask yourself, does this style actually work with anyone? 

&gt;Hey Einstein, explain to me the metaphysical difference between an apple that tastes like a strawberry and a strawberry that looks like an apple. You're going to have to think long and hard about this one. 

I don’t care about the metaphysical difference. I am talking about physical reality. And there is a lot of physical differences at a molecular level. Do you really not know this?

&gt;Simply stating ""muh genomes"" is not a goddamn argument and will not stand to reason in this context because you WILL NOT be able to differentiate between the genetic codes of either to determine which is which without referencing actuall Apples and actual Strawberries. Again. Think. Long. And. Hard. Before. You. Respond.

Are you serious? Of course you can. WTF are you talking about? Look at the molecular composition under a microscope and you will see the difference. Run chemical analysis and you can track differences in sequencing and such.

If you gave a biologist dna from an apple and dna from a strawberry you realize they would be able to figure out which was which right?

&gt;Yes, stupid. Do you realize that apple DNA is apple DNA because it is DNA that was extracted from an apple?

No it’s not. It is because of the observable difference in the structure and sequencing of the genetic material. Do you really not get this?

I’m going to stop right here because I realize that you must be a kid. Please go read up on how we use technology to analyze dna and genetic material. The arrangement in plants and animals is very different for one thing. Sequencing can be determined using chemical testing. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26880/) is a start.

&gt;Appeals to authority do not discredit the the premise. Also, if the genetic code is alter in such a significant way in the future then perhaps biologist will in fact give that species a different name.

So what do you call these creatures if not not ""human beings?"" Whether or not they have a different specieal name is a red herring.

&gt;Now you are moving goalposts. If you wanted to discuss personhood you should have just said that up front instead of trying to be so deceptive about it.

I defined human beings as entities which exhibited personhood to illustrate a non-circular argument that refutes your innately circular definition of ""human."" ""Personhood"" is irrelevant unless you reject the presupposition that all human beings are people which tends to be one of the foundational premises of abortion prohibitionist ideology.

This isn't an ""opinion,"" stupid. I'm explaining to you the metaphysical nature of categorization. Entity X is not entity x because it has x genome. X genome is x genome because it comes from entity x. Define entity x.

Not an argument. Get some goddamn reading comprehension.

&gt; Red herring now. The chemical composition is irrelevant to the subject of flavor being the essence of edible food products, organic or otherwise. Does apple flavored candy taste like apples? Yes or no?

You do realize that apples also have their own category of genomes right?

Yes, stupid. Do you realize that apple DNA is apple DNA because it is DNA that was extracted from an apple?

&gt; No stupid, it's narrative reasoning.

It's a very stupid narrative I'm surprised you've even convinced yourself.

&gt;So, if I inject an apple with strawberry flavouring according to you is that NOT an apple anymore because it doesn't taste like one?

I can't tell you what it would be because you havent defined what apples or strawberries are beyond the genetic code that can be extracted from them. But this begs the question.

Yes or no?

Assuming that they are genetically human (in the way biology defines) then yes, they are human.

&gt; You're making a claim to support your demonstrably fallacious appeal to genetics and the genotype as the property which gives human beings their human quality rather than inherent humaness and/or humanity of human beings as being the property which gives the (human) genome it's human quality. You have it completely backwards mate.

That's the way biology defines human. We use things that exist in physical reality to define things.

&gt; Why should I care if YOU think that abortions should be illegal because you believe fertilized eggs should be afforded the same legal protections as actual people? You're the one in dire need of consulting a biologist mate, not me.

When did I say anything to you about my beliefs on abortion or ask you to care about them? Stop making assumptions. If you want to know something then just ask.

&gt; Not only is this is an appeal to authority, the fact of the matter is that your appeal to an arbitrary percentage of genetic variation fails to take into account evolutionary theory as it applies to the genome. Humans born 500,000 years from now will have a genetic code significantly different from our own. Are they not also ""human?""

Appeals to authority do not discredit the the premise. Also, if the genetic code is alter in such a significant way in the future then perhaps biologist will in fact give that species a different name.

&gt; I don't think you understand what ""empircism"" is mate. The argument has nothing to do with empircism and everything to do with demonstrating the irrelevancy of genetics and genetic difference in the descriptive categorization of entities. Human DNA does not exhibit personhood. Nor do entities which posess human DNA (such as fetuses, or artificially grown organs, or dead bodies) necessarily exhibit personhood either.

Now you are moving goalposts. If you wanted to discuss personhood you should have just said that up front instead of trying to be so deceptive about it.

&gt; You can observe DNA and test that an enity assumed to be a member of category X has the same genome as other known members of category X. So what? Genes derive their essential categorical quality from the entity they come from. The entity being tested does not derive it's essential categorical quality from the genes extracted from it.

Good luck proving that opinion.

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but has human dna then it's probably someone in a halloween costume. Please do not so be so obtuse.

&gt; Yeah, and you failed to validate this reject with any sort of cogent reasoning or argument. If it looks like a duck but it doesn't quack like a duck then it isn't a duck. If it looks like an apple but it doesn't taste like an apple then it isn't an apple.

If is have the genetic properties of an apple it's an apple. Even if I paint it blue and it taste like the fucking paint. It's still an apple.

&gt; This is a glorious strawman. I never claimed apple flavored candy rings are apples. I said they taste like apples.

I am going to ignore this because it actually makes no sense and I don't see it as relevant to the discussion. If you look back at what you wrote you did in fact refer to it as an apple.

You do realize that apples also have their own category of genomes right?

It's a very stupid narrative I'm surprised you've even convinced yourself.

457,"There are a number of issues with this picture, so it's difficult to know where to begin. So, in no particular order...

-The originator doesn't seem to understand what an electroenchephalogram (EEG) is. They repeatedly refer to people not having EEGs as being brain dead, and that fetuses lack EEGs. However, an EEG is not something that you have, it's a test. A test that measures brain activity by recording electrical activity in the brain. Here's a helpful link on the subject by a neurological clinic called the [Mayfield Clinic](https://www.mayfieldclinic.com/PE-EEG.HTM). 

-""...an organism such as a fetus is by definition not alive due to the lack of EEG."" I'm not sure if this statement comes from the originators lack of understanding of what fetus means, or what EEGs are/measure. According to [Invitra](http://www.invitra.com/differences-between-a-zygote-an-embryo-and-a-fetus/), embryonic development can be broken into 3 stages: zygote (unicellular development, usually up 24 hours after fertilization), embryo (multicellular development), and fetus (development from roughly 8 weeks to birth). If they are attempting to argue that fetuses show no brain activity at any point, that's an outright falsehood. According to [What to Expect](http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-brain-nervous-system/), at 16 days the foundation of the brain is started. By 7 weeks, synapses form, independent movement begins, and neural activity occurs. This demonstrates that brain activity actually predates the fetal development stage. If we define life to be brain activity, then this is the point we would have to say the embryo is alive. However...,

-Brain activity is neither the legal, scientific, nor medical definition of life or death. Looking at it scientifically, if we declare brain activity measurable on an EEG to be the definition of life, then all plants are not alive. Coral, starfish, jellyfish, sea urchins, and more are not actually living creatures. That, of course, is false; scientifically these are all living creatures. That is because the *actual* scientific definition of life, according to [Biology Online](http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Life), life is defined ""by the capacity to grow, metabolize, respond (to stimuli), adapt, and reproduce."" An embryo at all levels of development meet this criteria. If you are already moving to type ""An embryo can't reproduce!!!"", please do not bother, unless you are prepared to argue just as ardently that a prepubescent 10 year old is not alive. An embryo is of such a kind and nature that, given proper time and normal development, will be able to reproduce, and as such meets the criteria. 

As for the legal definition, I'm not aware of any law on the books in the United States that actually defines this; please point it out to me if you are. In any case, the legal definition of life is not relevant, as it's the legal definitions and laws that are at debate here. According to [Leaving Well](http://leaving-well.org/legal-definition-of-death.php), the legal definition of death is ""irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions; or irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem."" Clearly, a fetus does *not* meet this criteria; an embryo without brain activity does not suffer irreversible cessation. Give it a few weeks and it will naturally develop it! I think my scientific treatment of life answers the medical definition claim as well.

Here is a hypothetical: suppose we have a healthy, perfectly normal 25 year-old man. Now, suppose that he suffers some malady such that higher brain functions shut down. As measured on an EEG, his brain is without activity. However, the autonomic nervous system continues, and his body continues functioning. He needs only a supply of nutrients via a feeding tube, and perhaps the occasional turning to avoid his body from developing bed sores. Finally, suppose that doctors are in agreement that, though his situation seems dire, he will in fact make a full recovery within a few weeks and return to full faculty and brain activity. Should it be legal to directly or indirectly (by withholding food) kill this man, as long as his brain waves are nil, despite knowing that he will recover and be well again in a few weeks time?",1,1487365563,2017-02-17 16:06:03

I understand what you are asking but I think the question oversimplifies the concept. It's not just about variance but also about types of variance. As far as I know they have mapped out many different types of variances. None as far as I know have a significant difference greater than 0.1%. So I'm assuming biologist would start there.

It is such an emotional charged subject so sticking to words that aren't loaded helps.

I usually use both the term fetus and child to show I don't want to fight or shove my view down someone's throat. 

I think there is some common ground we share. That is the notion that abortion is not a wonderful thing and reducing or eliminating them is key.

I also haven't met any prolifer or prochoicer who is not for the idea of making adoption more accessible and pregnancy, childbirth and parenting more socially supported.

So we could focus on those things.

In fact, I think the best thing about the video was that the author showed that there is a middle ground and abortion restrictions after a certain point are something most people in both camps can agree on. At least after viability (21-24 weeks).

And that's just the method of birth. Taking away their choice to birth at all almost assuredly has negative correlations to maternal health and well being, and by extension, fetal health and well being.

The illegality of assault and theft doesn't, in fact, stop those actions from occurring. They happen anyway, although they are illegal. And we don't argue that because people continue to commit such actions, we should just make them legal and not worry about the morality involved.

No one calls for publicly-funded assault centers where angry and violent people can beat up victims in a controlled setting. Anyone who argued for such a thing would be rightly viewed as crazy.

Catholic theology is more interested in the ""orderedness"" of the act than how good it feels.  Creation is good and is meant to be enjoyed.

That's because most religion beat reporters are overworked and have a minimal understanding of the complicated workings of the Catholic Church.  His last encyclical has been a bit of a complicated issue within the Church, but he's hardly the liberal the media paints him as.

That's not particularly relevant to the moral argument at hand though.  ""It's hard and they don't get it"" does nothing to answer the moral objections.  I agree though, we should absolutely do more to support pregnant women and mothers.   

&gt; Thus, sexual pleasure is only OK in that it produces children, so in this normative Catholic view, contraception **(and if you look at it, any effort to produce female orgasm)** are inherently wrong.

Not strictly true.  There's not an absolutely definitive teaching on this, but essentially as long as the act finishes in such a way that it is open to procreation it is considered morally licit.

169,"I'm a former Catholic. I left because of (of course) papal infallibility but also because of the church's stance on birth control and sexual pleasure. You have to realize that the Church draws its views from Augustine, a Platonist (technically a Neoplatonist). Platonism views matter as inherently second-class; pure ""Ideas"" are the ultimate good. Many early Christian apologists transformed this Platonistic philosophy to mean that the body should be subjected to the higher world of the spirit (or soul) created by God. Thus, to make a long story short, if it feels too good, it's sinful. Thus, sexual pleasure is only OK in that it produces children, so in this normative Catholic view, contraception (and if you look at it, any effort to produce female orgasm) are inherently wrong. Keep in mind that current stats say that only 25% of women are able to come through penetration alone. 

You may not feel like you as a man can dictate women's rights, but all the men in the Catholic hierarchy feel differently. Sure, Pope Francis is claimed to be liberal, but he's fine with saying that ""abortion is an absolute evil"" and that contraceptives *might* be OK in order to prevent the spread of disease—but not to prevent pregnancy. [See this story](https://www.ncronline.org/news/francis-signals-opening-contraceptives-deadly-zika-cases). This is nonsense, IMO. These are men who don't know what it's like to have a colicky baby and to live day to day on a fixed income. They can't possibly understand the toll that two pregnancies within a year put on a woman's body, but they're OK with condemning people for enjoying fucking. (Especially women who really like sex, even within marriage, and who have a contraceptive accident.)

You may not adhere to these Catholic dogmas; this would make you a so-called [""cafeteria Catholic""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafeteria_Catholicism).

191,"1. I mean physical costs (over and above financial costs). Later abortions can be days long, potentially taking weeks to fully conclude. Later pregnancy means more time feeling sick, more drastic changes to your body. If you hemorrhage from placental abruption, there are physical autoimmune costs associated with requiring a transfusion, even if the event doesn't cost you your life. 

2. It is you that are equating costs with dollars, not me. Right here, I am specifically saying that there are non-financial costs. Of which I find the physical most compelling. 

3. Here I am pointing out how ludicrous it would because there is no appropriate recompense for the physical risks, but also no other means to provide appropriate incentives to the male partner. I'm not advocating it as a solution, I'm just showing the idiocy of attempting to equate the man's decision with the woman's. 

I'm not concerned with the *size* of the sperm vs.egg. Jeez.  Egg donation is costly because it requires weeks of injections, daily transvaginal ultrasounds and blood tests, followed by surgery under anesthesia. All physical costs. Gestational carriers are expensive because they require 9 months of highly medicalized lifestyle changes and  physical risk. Again physical costs. Sperm donation requires an orgasm. A physical cost?  Perhaps, but a minor one in comparison.

It is simply much easier to find men who are willing to have orgasms to father someone else's child than it is to find women who are willing (and able) to carry a baby to term for someone else.",2,1485285522,2017-01-24 14:18:42

194,"No one is going to argue with you that it takes both sperm and egg to create a child; that's a no-brainer.

However, women's rights should be paramount as far as their own bodies are concerned because the genders are *not* the same biologically. Pregnancy takes a huge toll on a woman's body and emotions. Imagine feeling run down (and having flu-like symptoms) for months on end. Imagine feeling light-headed and unable to think clearly or remember where you parked your car for eight months straight. Imagine hating sex, and being unable to orgasm, for ten months in a row. Imagine bleeding, and being a depressive mess, for two months in a row. This is what pregnancy and childbirth have been like for me. Don't even get me started on breastfeeding, which literally made me want to die.

Men don't go through this. Every time I have been pregnant, I have desperately wished I were I man because it would be *so much easier*.

And the fact is, the vast majority of women naturally put much more effort (and time) into child-rearing than their partner does. They're biologically compelled to do so.

Life would be so much easier for many women if the abortion pill were available OTC. However, this would never happen because of the (minimal) risk of ectopic pregnancy. I would just like to see all the waiting periods (between a first and second session) lifted at abortion clinics; and also all the restrictions on physicians looking to legally perform abortions.

Anywhere. Abortion pills would be available for sale over the counter in pharmacies and clinics would offer surgical procedures in every major town.

&gt; Does the government provide tax money for contraceptives or abortions? 

Yes, along with all other healthcare, it is funded entirely through taxation and free at the point of need.

&gt; Does the time of an abortion matter?

Abortion would not be illegal at any stage of pregnancy. However, I would want education campaigns encouraging people to get abortions as early as possible to minimize health risks, as well as to prevent pregnancy in the first place using contraception.

I don't want to go into all the non-abortion aspects of defining an ""ideal government"" because that's way too broad to answer here.",14,1485272873,2017-01-24 10:47:53
202,"Speaking as someone who is pro-choice, I would actually rather see fewer abortions happen. However, I know that the best way to accomplish that is to make them unnecessary, not to make them illegal.

Ideally, we would use the following proven methods:

* Proper comprehensive sex education in schools. The more you understand about the process, the better the choices you can make.  
* Readily available birth control, preferably subsidized for all but at the very least for those who suffer from financial hardship.   
* Extended maternity (and paternity) support structures, to help remove financial concerns. Medical coverage for pre- and post-natal care, longer paid leaves, subsidized child care. If you want more people to choose to raise a child, you have to make sure that pregnancy is not a financial disaster for the parent(s).

These three things address many of the most common reasons that women have abortions, and have been used to great effect in order to reduce abortion rates even in countries where abortions are freely available.

After that:
  
* Abortions should be available in every hospital, without literal lies being told to the patient (like ""abortions cause cancer"") or unnecessary infantilization of the patient (waiting periods and spousal consent).  
* I absolutely want the government to fund them, and I frankly don't care if paying for abortions hurts someone's feelings. My taxes pay to bomb people, which I find just as abhorrent, but nobody gives me a free pass to get out of that.  
* Time of an abortion doesn't matter. There's a lot of hand-wringing over ""late-term abortions"", but the truth of the matter is that women only get them if there's something seriously wrong, like the fetus not actually developing a brain.",15,1485270664,2017-01-24 10:11:04

205,"First of all, l want to thank you, not only for commenting but for commenting respectfully. I hope you do not take my arguments as disrespect by any means.

You immediately start off by saying, ""Your argument equates financial autonomy with bodily autonomy, even though they are not the same thing,"" yet all throughout your explanation, you consistently bring up financial endeavors as the reason for an abortion.

1. ""Pregnancy and abortion is progressively more costly for the woman. This provides a natural incentive for the woman, if she is going to have an abortion, to have it as early in the process as possible.""

2. ""...and if it was would be financially, emotionally, and physically tremendously costly for her...""

3. ""Does he need to pay her back in any way for the time he spent deliberating?  What would an appropriate recompense be?  Would it depend on how costly the pregnancy was for her?  How much money he had?""

 And last, ""And yet you are more concerned with protecting men's wallets than women's bodies and lives."" Which is quite a hypocritical statement, since you make it seem that one of the main reasons a woman would want an abortion to protect her wallet in the long run. You said it yourself, it is cheaper to have an abortion than to carry full term, and yet thereafter.

Let's talk about this quote. ""That's because men have much less if what they need to make a baby.""

In truth, you equate the size of the sperm compared to the size of an egg, to importance. Or rather, you equate the time it takes a man to conceive to the time it takes a woman to conceive, to importance.

But think about this. Try to have a baby, when you are ready, without sperm. Not sperm from your partner, not sperm from a donor. Try to have a baby without any contribution from a man.

You cannot. It's impossible. A woman needs a man as EQUALLY as a man needs a woman to even conceive a child, whether the sperm is the size of the head of needle, or the egg is 1000x bigger.",1,1485264606,2017-01-24 08:30:06
206,Adoption does not solve the problem of being pregnant when you don't want to be. It doesn't protect you against the health effects of pregnancy. EVERY pregnancy carries a risk of the woman dying. Noone should ever be legally obliged to take that risk.,2,1485264315,2017-01-24 08:25:15

215,I just thought it was contradictory to consider a fetus a person in some cases but not in others.,2,1485261497,2017-01-24 07:38:17
216,"Your argument equates financial autonomy with bodily autonomy, even though they are not the same thing.  Women take on every physical burden of procreation.  Pregnancy itself is full of very real risks. And you don't actually have a baby at the beginning of pregnancy. If a man who desperately wants a baby took a blastocyst under his most diligent care, its potential to someday become a baby would be outstripped by the lack of womb. That's because men have much less if what they need to make a baby.   It's much easier to acquire sperm from a donor than either eggs or a gestational surrogate. Unfair in some ways, but true. 

Still, I am sympathetic to the plea that parenthood without consent is problematic. I'm just not sure how it would work in practice.  Pregnancy and abortion is progressively more costly for the woman. This provides a natural incentive for the woman, if she is going to have an abortion, to have it as early in the process as possible.  This isn't naturally true of men's contributions. 

Let's imagine a woman who would abort if her partner won't support the child, but will keep it if he will. When does he need to make that decision by?  Before she starts to experience the morning sickness and exhaustion of early pregnancy (less costly for her)? Or is he allowed to wait until viability, when an elective abortion is no longer available for her (and if it was would be financially, emotionally, and physically tremendously costly for her). Does he need to pay her back in any way for the time he spent deliberating?  What would an appropriate recompense be?  Would it depend on how costly the pregnancy was for her?  How much money he had?

Would such a decision be permanent?  You assume that men don't get custody, but men usually don't *ask* for custody. When they do, they are as if not more likely to get it than women (provided they do so from the beginning and don't wait until the kid is older and already stable in their new home environment). If she carries to term after he objects, does that terminate his parents' potential claim on the child as well?  What if he changes his mind?

Finally, the woman's bodily autonomy is still apparently up for political discussion in the U.S. And yet you are more concerned with protecting men's wallets than women's bodies and lives. I don't see why your issue should be prioritized over a woman's control over her own medical decisions. Perhaps you could at least recognize that empowered women won't need as much legal ""protection"" in the form of mandatory child support as those whose bodies are used to hold them captive. If women are actually fully given that autonomy without argument. I would guess that most feminists would be glad to rectify financial imbalances.",9,1485256286,2017-01-24 06:11:26

328,"&gt; 1) It is very natural for a woman to have a child inside her. It is not an exotic parasite that somehow invaded their body, but a very common process of pregnancy. As a mother, you have the natural obligation to take care or your child.

The premise does not support the conclusion. The only ""obligation"" is the one you impart upon the mother. There is nothing you can cite to demonstrate this is a ""natural obligation.""

&gt;2) When having (protected) sex, the man and women accept the risk of her getting pregnant, and they should accept the responsibilities that come with it.

They may only accept the consequence knowing abortion is available in the event of that consequence. And accepting the possibility of the consequence does not mean accepting the responsibility in any event. If the pregnancy is unintended, then the responsibilities are not accepted by extension. Additionally, *they* don't accept the responsibilities, since the woman gives birth, and both can absolve themselves of parenthood through legal, and accepted, means. Lastly, you can't even be consistently pro-life and mandate a woman accept the ""responsibilities"" of pregnancy. Carrying a fetus to term can be life threatening to the woman, a ""risk"" the couple having sex creates. Does this confer onto the woman a responsibility to carry that pregnancy to term?

If you think it is, I assume you've already donated one kidney via the [National Kidney Foundation](https://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/where-do-start-anonymous) to avoid murdering someone who needs it?

So you support abortion in cases of rape. How would you like to enforce that? If claiming to have been raped is the only way of getting an abortion, expect false accusations to skyrocket.",14,1484593931,2017-01-16 14:12:11

You can't even take organs or anything else from corpses unless they gave you permission to do so when they were alive. 

The same thing applies for abortion. Nobody can force me to give up my blood, organs, or any other body part. Deciding what to do with my body and everything in it is my choice.

348,"Thank you for your reply.

Your first argument is utilitarian. If the total amount of pleasure minus pain in state A is higher than in state B, we prefer state A over state B. In my opinion, this view ignores the important notion of rights.  A violation of a right is not permitted, even if everyone benefits from this violation. If we see the fetus as a person with rights (specifically, a right to live), then we may not kill it without its consent. Just like we may not kill grown-ups, even if the world might be a better place if we do.

Regarding your second point, I acknowledge the bodily autonomy of people. There is a conflict between two fundamental rights: the right of women to decide what happens with their body, and the right of the child to live. But why do you think the right of the women outweighs the right of the child in this matter? I would advocate the opposite, since 1) It is very natural for a woman to have a child inside her. It is not an exotic parasite that somehow invaded their body, but a very common process of pregnancy. As a mother, you have the natural obligation to take care or your child. 2) When having (protected) sex, the man and women accept the risk of her getting pregnant, and they should accept the responsibilities that come with it.",-2,1484579633,2017-01-16 10:13:53
349,"I'm pro-choice because it's better if all children are wanted children.

If a child is unwanted, they can be impoverished, neglected, and/or abused. Abortion in these cases is the moral thing to do because it spares the fetus a lifetime of suffering, which is a greater wrong than ending its life. Abortion in this case also ends up better for everyone overall because then young people grow up with love and support and are less likely to engage in criminal activity, subsist entirely on welfare, live a life spreading emotional distress, etc.

There's also the matter of bodily autonomy, in that a person with a uterus has the right to decide what happens in and to their body. If that person does not want to be pregnant, they have the right to terminate. If we do not give them that right, then they have less rights than corpses, whose organs cannot be donated without their previous consent.",18,1484576901,2017-01-16 09:28:21

463,"&gt;When you take that option away from desperate women who cannot afford a child, they will seek out an abortion and possibly die of a massive infection

The most commonly cited reason for an abortion is financial strain. Federal financial assistance will mitigate this largest chunk. Other given reasons are arguably also mitigated by counseling and material assistance. I believe the reason so many women sought back-alley abortions in the pre-70s was because of the severe lack of assistance for struggling mothers / families and the greater stigma against pre-marital sex at the time. 2017 is not pre-1973.

&gt;No amount of Counselling will make up for the fact that a woman is being forced to risk her life and give birth

I also believe that every possible measure can ethically be taken to preserve the life of the mother, even if it _indirectly_ leads to fetal death. The key is not directly killing the fetus, but measures can be taken to save her even if they will certainly result in fetal death as a side-effect. Not opposed to this.

&gt;Why do we have to reduce the number of a medical procedure? What I choose to do to my uterus isn't the your business.

There is 131.4 million births per year. Do the math. So you have a 0.0023 % chance of death. There is a higher chance of being hit by lightning. You are actually proving my point.

&gt;First world countries allow abortion. That's why the pregnancy/mortality rate is lower... and you want to change that... brilliant!! Derp!

No not all first world countries allow abortions. In fact, I’m pretty sure I already mentioned most restrict abortions. Countries with medical availabilities such as antibiotics makes all the difference. Abortion is not some magic solution to problems in pregnancy. I have a feeling you have never been pregnant.

&gt;Note that the countries with the highest mortality rates do not allow abortions. And since the religious nut bags in the US have started with TRAP laws, the mortality rate of mostly black pregnant women has risen sharply. But don't concern yourself with dead black women. Birth them babies!

I’ve already provided you with proof to the contrary. Go read the my last response. Countries with the highest abortion restrictions (Ireland, Poland, Chile) have the highest maternal health rates. Here is some more info although I doubt you will read them.

Source?

&gt;Fact is .. the woman's life is always at risk. There is no guarantee that medical intervention can help or arrive in time. I don't care if it's only 1 woman.

You literally have about a 1 in 5,000 chance of dying in childbirth in a DEVELOPED country. That is 0.02% (and this includes woman who are not exhibiting normal healthy pregnancies). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death

My chances of dying from the flu are 3,697 in 100, 000. That is 3.5%. My chances from dying of the flu are significantly higher than dying from childbirth. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/flu.htm

Anyone who know statistics know that this is a very, very, very, extremely small percent.

Can I kill someone who is sitting beside me with the flu because I might get it and I might die (even though the chance is so minuscule)? According to your logic the answer would be yes. 

&gt;No one of any age has the right to use another person'a body against their will. In that respect a fetus has the same rights as everyone else. Happy now?

Not true. Conjoined twins and children under certain situations do.

&gt;Forcing women to give birth or die trying is morally reprehensible in my eyes. None of your condescending and illogical nonsense is going to change that.

Because your eyes are closed. And just for the record I haven’t said one condescending or illogical thing. Your feelings are blinding you.

&gt;Added link: 

http://savitatruth.com/facts/

&gt;And imo anyone that would force a rape victim to give birth is reprehensible. And their opinion means absolutely nothing to me.

Great for you. I see you are very emotional and maybe you shouldn’t be trying to have a reasonable conversation because you can’t right now.

&gt;Personally, I would have never wanted anyone to force my mother to gestate and give birth to me. If she had wanted an abortion,. She would have had my blessing ... 

I don’t see how that has any bearing on this conversation though?

&gt;but since I would have had no cognitive ability at the time, I wouldn't have known and would not have cared. How much do you hate your mother to say she should have been forced to birth you? Self-important much?

Again I don’t see the relevance?

&gt;I believe in quality of life over quantity of life. Every. Single. Time.

You believe it is ok to kill another human being to preserve your own perceived quality of life and I don't.

6,"I think that you overestimate the profit motive in providing abortions.

If Planned Parenthood were so dedicated to making money off of abortions as some would like to claim, why do they provide 10x as much contraception services? (thereby presumably reducing their pool of potential ""customers"").  Providers are legally not allowed to collect taxpayer dollars for abortion, so they must charge patients in order to recoup their costs.  

I have seen no documentation that the amount of revenue that they bring in from abortion does more than cover the cost of providing those services.

The idea that children need to be routinely protected by the court is a rather new one.  In abuse cases, the children can be removed from the home.  But in the case of pregnancy, any removal is just another word for abortion.  I am not certain that abortion results in a class of people who are unprotected.  In general, by the time they are developed anywhere close to enough to be children, abortion is already very rare.

As a (happily) pregnant woman who understands how medically precarious pregnancy and childbirth can be, the criminalization of pregnancy is scary to me.  If my fetus's gestational sac were to break right now, she would certainly die (I am 16 weeks pregnant).  It scares me to think that the hospital closest to my home (a Catholic hospital), the place where I hope to deliver her, might refuse to promptly treat such a miscarriage that is becoming septic because her heart would still be beating, and pro-life thinking can be arbitrary and not medically informed.  A decision like that could lead to my death.  Like it did for Savita Halappanavar or Valentia Milluzzo.

&gt;if a father was isolated with his infant and there was enough formula to feed the child and he deliberately did not do so with the intention of killing her (and there was clear evidence of this) would you honestly say that he should not be criminally charged?

I am not sure how such evidence could be known in an actual situation.  Babies do sometimes fail to thrive despite all efforts to feed them.  And if the father was not knowledgeable about how to feed the baby, or became overwhelmed by the prospect, it would be hard to prove murderous intent.  In general, the situation where someone both doesn't have access to a broader community willing to step in to provide support AND doesn't have the inclination to feed a child are so rare, that I think people use circumstantial evidence (overall perceived character of the father) to make the decision of whether or not to charge.  Which is not exactly justice, either.

Furthermore, what are some other rational reasons that a father may elect not to feed a newborn?  Let's say that the father left the child in the cabin (suitably dressed) so that he could collect firewood so that they wouldn't both freeze to death, or he had to go to get help for other children also trapped in the cabin?  What if he had two children, and determined that the newborn's chance of survival (being sick) was small enough, that he couldn't afford to prioritize her life over the life of the other child?  Let's assume that he has conflicting responsibilities and priorities, because that is the reality for adults in the world.  No situation is simple or cut and dried.  

When your hypothetical erases these complexities it bears less and less resemblance to the realities that pregnant women face.  Pregnancy involves many interlocking factors and people with varied interests (the consequences of losing a job, the impact on other children).  Prolife laws cannot be written to include every variation of complexity to make sure that her situation is safe enough that she can afford to be pregnant without disastrous consequence.",1,1480370153,2016-11-28 16:55:53
7,"If the child's had the *same* right to life as the mother, abortion on demand would be fine up until viability, at which point removal from the woman's body on demand would continue to be fine (while preserving the child's life if possible).

It is my understanding that even in the case of conjoined twins, it is not true that one twin can insist that they *not be removed* from the other twin's body (only that their life be preserved if possible).  If you have different information, could you link it?  I agree that doctors involved are required to take into consideration the viability and life of both persons.  According to accepted medical practice.

In the case of the fetus, the mother can ask that it is removed, but not necessarily that it be killed.  As it happens, removing a fetus always results in its death up until viability, so the distinction is somewhat moot.  Still, it is only by giving the child rights over and above those of any born person, that we arrive at the conclusion that the woman is obligated to donate her body to that child at the discretion of the court.",1,1480365046,2016-11-28 15:30:46

&gt;I'm not surprised at all that you think having sex is the reason why women should be obligated to give birth. 

I actually do not think this at all. In fact, I was simply giving you the explanation some prolifers will use to extend the exception for rape victims. I am actually on the fence about what I believe in this area. I think I am more along the lines of the right to life outweighs bodily autonomy. Either way I am not steadfast on one or the other at this point.  

There is a lot of stuff here. And I want to thoroughly read it and will get back as soon as I can. I'm a bot swamped with work at the moment.

9,"&gt;The part that you are missing is the woman's body. The one that sustains the pregnancy at considerable cost and risk to herself, and any other children she may have/care for. She is not a bystander, and it is not a passive gift. It is one that she pays for every day that she is pregnant.

I feel like I understand that pregnancy can be highly demanding and at times can become risky. At the same time however, it seems that prochoicers that want abortion on demand are not acknowledging the body of the child. You know what I mean? I wonder, if you really believed that the child was equal and worthy of the same rights as the mother how would you resolve the problem?

&gt;Prochoicers point out that no one has a right to life that they are not capable of on their own. That is, no one (born or not) has the right to use another's body to survive. People don't have the right to demand organs even from the dead.

And I think this is where our disagreement lies then. Because prolifers believe that parents have the added responsibility of duty of care toward their children's basic needs. At least in cases of consensual sex.

&gt;Born people (even newborns) do not require another person's body to survive. Care of newborns can be (and is) transferred to others on a regular basis. Our society is committed to providing them with the resources to survive, but parents are not required to feed their children their own flesh if they are all dying of starvation. 

But parents are required to feed their children. As far as I know bodily autonomy is not restricted to specific part.

&gt;If a woman was isolated in the cabin with a newborn and the child died of starvation and the woman did not, would you assume that she was at fault? Would you investigate her for murder?

No and no. Unless there was obvious foul play. However, if a father was isolated with his infant and there was enough formula to feed the child and he deliberately did not do so with the intention of killing her (and there was clear evidence of this) would you honestly say that he should not be criminally charged?

&gt;By extending the rights of the unborn to include utilization of the mother's body, you are giving the unborn a ""right"" no born person has. It is only when you forget that there is a woman involved in the pregnancy, that this even makes sense.

I don’t think the right to life extends to utilization though. I think the positive right to parental responsibility extends to the body though. I also think there is an assumption made here that just because someone can not sustain their own life they are automatically excluded from the right to not be killed and I don’t see the basis for that assumption.

&gt;Courts do not weigh in on the separation of conjoined twins. They trust the family and doctors involved to weigh the viability of each twin, and determine the best medical outcome, even if it results in the death of one of the twins. 

Court have weighed in on cases between twins actually. In some countries there have been forced separation to save one child’s life. The point is that an adult twin can not decide that they have had enough of their sibling and kill him/her. The decision to separate take into consideration safety, viability and life of BOTH persons not just one.

&gt;I trust the woman and doctors involved (according to accepted medical practice) to weigh the viability of the fetus against the risk and cost to the mother.

Unfortunately I don’t have the same faith in all humanity as you. I think that if history has taught us anything it’s that people are not always altruistic and industries will do anything for a buck. It just doesn’t sit right knowing that a whole group of human beings are completely unprotected.

11,"Thanks for taking the time to respond and for giving some thought to my points. I have just a few more things to add and a few questions. 

How do you feel about consent? Can consent to sex be withdrawn during sex? What about consent to an organ donation? If I decide to donate my kidney to someone (and they need it within 24 hours so once I agree to donate it, that's their only shot), do you think I should be allowed to withdraw my consent if I get cold feet? What do you think is the role the government should play in regulating consent? 

I'm not surprised at all that you think having sex is the reason why women should be obligated to give birth. Actually, when we get down to it I really do think this is the real issue of contention and i commend you for admitting it. Can you see how it comes off to me as if you are slut shaming women for having sex? As if they did some kind of crime that deserves the government torturing them? (I know we have different definitions of torture, but I'm going to respectfully continue to use it the way the dictionary defines it). 

So my big question is this: I am a tokophobic woman. I literally have nightmares about being pregnant and giving birth. While I love kids and can't wait to adopt beautiful children with my SO one day, I'm well aware that my mental state is not healthy for being pregnant. In fact, the anti-depressants I'm on would likely cause fetal deformities if I were forced to keep a pregnancy tomorrow (you can't go cold turkey off anti depressants). I know we've talked before and you don't like when I use the phrase ""reproductive slave"". So show me how I wouldn't be a reproductive slave in your world. How do you, as a pro-lifer, suggest that I 100% *guarantee* I will *never* be forced by the government to experience torture and be forced to reproduce? Let's hear you say it, and make sure not to forget to include rape exceptions. 

Also one last thing - if the government DID try to force me to give birth, I would likely kill myself first and the baby would die too. You can say that I'm mentally unstable (which is kind of my point here - I'm totally unstable when it comes to pregnancy, that's what a phobia is) and you can say that I should get help (been in therapy for this for years), but let's just put all our cards out there. I walk into the police station with a gun to my head, threatening to kill myself if I can't get an abortion. Do you strap me down for 9 months and force feed me when I go on hunger strike? Do I get a ""health exception"" for mental health? How does this work?

12,"&gt;I actually find the exact opposite. Pro-choicers tend to very consistent in saying that one person is not obligated to suffer a risky medical condition and/or torture to save the life of another person.

I think that we both agree here. I think the problem is that our definition of risky is different. 

&gt;whereas pro-government-mandated-birthers tend to be ok with other situations where one person is not forced by the government to risk their body to save the life of another (I.e. Organ donation).

Yes, prolifers generally agree that abortion is not about force. It's about requiring inaction on the part of others. The right to life or the right to not be killed obliges inaction. However, prolifers yend to agree that a child has positive rights that oblige parents to act in certain circumstances (not all). So for example, organ donation is not required but feeding is. Most also tend to be ok with abortion in cases of health/life.

&gt;It's actually this hypocrisy that I find most frustrating about the pro-government-mandated-birth side. I did find one person that thinks organ donation should be obligatory, but only one.

I think I am seeing where the disconnect is happening. here. 

&gt;Every other person I've met arguing your side seems to think we can just let a child of 5 with leukemia die cause their dad is the only match for stem cells and he doesn't feel like donating them. Yet pregnancy... well that is NATURAL. 

Hmmm. I see what you are getting at. Although I think the prolifers who holds that there is an exception for victims of rape are consistent here. Since in their mind the act of consensual sex presupposes the parental responsibility that will come if a child (human fetus) begins to exist as a consequence. In the case of the child with leukemia, the parent is not responsible for their condition and the need is uncommon. On the other hand, prolifers who do not allow for this exception claim that a parent must provide for the common needs of their children (depending on their age/development) and will say that organ donation is not a common need (as in all children require it). In addition, they will point to the difference between direct and active killing as opposed to an inaction.   

&gt;Women are meant to give birth. It's only a minor 9 month inconvenience (as opposed to the half hour procedure to donate stem cells - which is pretty much just a blood donation - that would be required of the father in the example above). Ugh it's so hypocritical and dehumanizing of women.

Sure I get what you are saying. Pregnancy can be much more than an inconvenience. In fact, if you are living in a country with little or no social assistance it can be overwhelmingly hard. Not to mention that pregnancies can turn into health/life risks. However, as a prolifer myself I can say that it’s not the expectation that women are meant to give birth that makes me hold this viewpoint. Rather it’s the premise that all living and human beings are of equal worth and ought to have equal rights. If I don’t accept killing in like situations then I can not justify it in the case of abortion (and I think trying to characterize it as letting die doesn't work because it would be inconsistent. We would never say that a parent who placed their child in an environment not conducive to life and let them die was only relieving themselves of their unwanted duty of care and did not really kill her).     

I think I can see that we are not on the same page when it comes to the terms medical condition, torture, passive/active, direct/indirect.

15,"Believing that a fetus has intrinsic worth is not the same as it actually being equivalent to a child.  I don't believe it is.

Ask a woman who desperately wants a baby and has had 6 failed rounds of IVF if she thinks a fertilized egg = a baby.  Ask her if she would choose to save her own 5-day blastocyst over someone else's child.  While I have known many women who have hoped and prayed specifically for a healthy 5-day blastocyst, none of them would imagine it to be a baby.  None.

In fact, a woman who wants one child, and has undergone weeks or months of hormone treatments to have eggs harvested at much expense to herself.  If only one fertilizes, she will probably weep because she will have every reason to believe that this is *not likely* to produce a child.

A fertilized egg is not a baby.  A blastocyst is not a baby.  A fetus is not a baby.  All can have incredible intrinsic worth, but only a baby is a baby.

I say this as a woman who has seen a picture of a 5-day blastocyst that has since developed into the 16-week fetus that (I hope) continues to grow in my uterus.

&gt;I think that abortions to save the life of the mother are a matter of triage care.

How much risk to the mother's life should exist before an abortion is warranted?  Must it be 100%?  90%?  50%?  30%?

15% of pregnancies have life-threatening complications, most of which are resolved through aggressive prenatal/medical care.  If a woman hemorrhages due to placenta abruption, was her life in danger or not (because she was able to receive donated blood)?  If her risk of death was 5% and she hemorrhages and dies because she was refused medical care that she asked for, does that mean that a mistake was made, or are those just ""the breaks""?

What about a woman's other children?  Let's say a woman knows from past pregnancies that she will likely need to be hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarium, and that she will likely develop preeclampsia in the third trimester (because she has twice before).  Let's further imagine that her current living situation is contingent on keeping a job that she would lose due to those hospitalizations.  

Must she submit to her current born children being made homeless to save a *potential* baby?  Should she just let them be put into foster care if she becomes so poor and ill that she isn't able to care for them?  What is the risk to them of their mother's pregnancy?  Is that considered in your calculus of what sorts of risks others must take on, or simply ignored?

Should such a woman and her husband be expected to be abstinent until she is in her forties?  ",1,1480276733,2016-11-27 14:58:53

17,"&gt; The idea that pregnancy and childbirth compare to a chute that delivers a fully formed baby in moments is a stunning erasure of women's contribution to the creation of their children.

The claim you made which I responding to was that because the probability is low for creating a dependent human being as a result of the sex act then that somehow makes them less responsible for the human being they created.

The illustration I provided shows that claim is false.

&gt; If someone pushes a button to fulfill a basic human need for intimate pair bonding, and on the off chance an uncertain process starts that may ultimately create a baby - but only if the stars align AND it is allowed to continue at great expense and risk to that person for months - then that person runs to stop the process long before the baby is created, then there is no baby to be responsible for. Because the process was stopped before the baby was created.

This begs the question - specifically ""the process is stopped before the baby was created"" begs the question. Of course, if the being that is in the womb has no intrinsic moral worth then it has no rights worth respecting in the first place. I believe that it does have intrinsic moral worth and deserves right to life respect. That is a different issue which should be assumed by bodily autonomy arguments that attempt to justify abortion. You're not granting that premise and thus undermining the point of bodily autonomy justifications by begging that question in your response here.

&gt; Also - do you think that sex should be limited to those that are healthy enough (and wealthy enough) to be able to bear children? 

I think that everyone is free to have sex when they want but if their act results in the creation of a needy human being then they ought to be legally compelled to provide for that normal need.

&gt; Would you think it was reasonable to ask a woman who's life would be threatened by a pregnancy to simply never have sex with her husband?

18,"The part that you are missing is the woman's body.  The one that sustains the pregnancy at considerable cost and risk to herself, and any other children she may have/care for.  She is not a bystander, and it is not a passive gift.  It is one that she pays for every day that she is pregnant.

Prochoicers point out that no one has a right to life that they are not capable of on their own.  That is, no one (born or not) has the right to use another's body to survive.  People don't have the right to demand organs even from the dead.

Born people (even newborns) do not *require* another person's *body* to survive.  Care of newborns can be (and is) transferred to others on a regular basis.  Our society is committed to providing them with the resources to survive, but parents are not required to feed their children their own flesh if they are all dying of starvation.  If a woman was isolated in the cabin with a newborn and the child died of starvation and the woman did not, would you assume that she was at fault?  Would you investigate her for murder?

By extending the rights of the unborn to include utilization of the mother's body, you are giving the unborn a ""right"" no born person has.  It is only when you forget that there is a woman involved in the pregnancy, that this even makes sense.

Courts do not weigh in on the separation of conjoined twins.  They trust the family and doctors involved to weigh the viability of each twin, and determine the best medical outcome, even if it results in the death of one of the twins.  I trust the woman and doctors involved (according to accepted medical practice) to weigh the viability of the fetus against the risk and cost to the mother.",2,1480271935,2016-11-27 13:38:55

This is what I quoted,

This is what I missed, 

&gt;via utilization of the mother's body) that is and has always been the issue.

I apologize for not quoting you properly and thank you u/tamist for pointing it out. 

I have a comment and question about this,

&gt;I was articulating that the ""right to life"" you may hope to give to a fetus is not something that the fetus is capable of on its own, but only by relying on someone else's body.

I think that herein lies the problem. Prolifers believe that the right to life is inalienable. It’s not granted but recognized and belongs to all living, human beings.

Therefore, the right to life is not affected by whether or not a person is capable of sustaining their own life. It simply means the right to not be killed.

The line of reasoning you present becomes confusing to a prolifer because when presented with like situations prochoicers tend to not be consistent.

For example, when describing situations where a born human being is dependent on another for survival (newborn, life support patient, conjoined twins) a prochoicer usually agree we can not kill them. They will say you can transfer responsibility in at least the first two cases. To which I usually reply, let’s imagine a hypothetical where you can not transfer responsibility (stuck in cabin type scenario or something). Or the conjoined twins can separate. To which I will reply, not on demand and without apology. It is either done to save a life or if the chances of safety are high.

For me the discussion usually breaks down around here. What am I missing?

Do you find this to be the case in conversations you’ve had? If so, can you explain what you think is happening? 

Thanks for the response.

&gt;Being a mother is all about giving up being selfish. Mothers need to be selfless.

I'm not sure what to make of this.  My mother tried so hard to be selfless and ended up resentful much of the time.  If she had taken more time to take care of herself, my childhood would have been much less stressful.  I am glad to make the choices that I am making, but I vehemently disagree that the essence of motherhood/womanhood is *self-sacrifice*.  I want my soon-to-be daughter to see limitless horizons and be audacious in following her dreams, not preparing herself for sacrifice! 

I think it would be wonderful if every woman who wanted to carry and birth a child was supported enough to be able to do so.  It sounds like for you, your second thoughts were mostly related to fears and concerns about not being supported.  I am glad that you were.  I hope your mother finds peace; she deserves it.  Perhaps being a more supportive parent than she had has helped her to let go of some of her pain.

For myself, I'm actually thrilled to be pregnant despite the morning sickness.  My husband and I utilized IVF to get pregnant and we are in no way ""on the fence"" about this pregnancy or our desire to build a family (which I am sure will be radically life-altering).  And, really, the hard moments will be ones that we pined for as much as the blissful moments, and that doesn't feel like self-sacrifice to me.  That feels like getting what we always wanted.

Being pregnant has actually made me value my choice to be pregnant as much or more than the choice to not be pregnant.  I am so glad that I can choose to give my body to this magical endeavor, rather than having the sacrifice forced on me.  When I am sickest (and I am still vomiting at 16 weeks, so, yeah), the fact that I want this and am choosing it makes me feel so powerful and alive.

If a woman really wants an abortion, she's not interested in ""being referred to an adoption agency"" or anything else.  She wants the abortion, the sooner, the better.   PP was there for me a few decades ago when I was just a kid starting a new job in a big city.

I see facts established as causations where they are only correlated.

The basis of the article (that mental health is ignored) is flawed; mental health requires significantly different services than physical health, and PP's mandate is not to provide psychological support although they can provide referrals. By the article's logic, we should also condemn hospitals because physicians are not therapists, and many medical treatments can take a heavy toll on people (women), not just abortions.

I have but I agree let's avoid feelings as an argument. I regret putting that comment in there. Disregard. It was late.

&gt; If you legally and physically force someone to experience child birth I don't know what you can call it besides torture..

I would call it not allowing killing your child as a solution to your situation unless there is a serious medical reason. :)

That's slavery and torture and a huge over step of government reach. It goes far beyond asking someone to feed a baby with a bottle, which like I said - we don't even do.

As I pointed out in past responses, parents are morally and legally obliged to feed their children. Also, I'm not going to lie, I think this whole concept of pregnancy being torture is bogus. Perhaps you can make this claim when faced with a high risk pregnancy in a underdeveloped nation. But I am talking about a normal pregnancy in a developed country.
 
&gt; And yes, every pregnancy is a risk to a woman's life and health, both medically speaking and practically speaking. Maybe you need r/biology or r/medicine..

I researched the numbers on this. It is only true if you accept that everything is a risk to health and life. Standing beside another person is a risk. A kid swinging beside me at the park is a risk. Taking my kid to a check up at the doctors is risk. Being stuck up at my cottage with my nephew who contracted the flu is a risk.

But the risk is so small we don't even consider it. And I still cant kill the other person who is putting me in jeopardy.

There has to be a serious risk. Like a person is attacking me with a knife kind of deal.

Neither is a normal pregnancy. But taking care of children especially a newborn can be very taxing on a parents well being actually.

Imagine a situation where they can not relinquish responsibility. A remote cabin type scenario. Still can't kill the child.

&gt;Shouldn't it be up to me and my doctor? 

Only if there is decent prolife legislation limiting the decision to theraputic situations and not elective ones.

&gt;It's a medical decision about my body. 

It can be a medical decision involving your body and the body of another human being. And both bodies need to be considered.

For the same reason I get to call children's services if a parent is being abusive. Because another human being is being abused and killed and just any old reason is not a justification for killing.

I think it actually made me crave proper prolife legislation all the more actually. We are in Canada and there are no restriction so it was very difficult for her to find a doctor that understood where she was coming from as a prolife woman. They all were pushing for termination at 12 weeks. She kept trying to explain that the risk to her life had to be very significant (greater than the norm) or else she wasn't going to terminate. Had there been some prolife legislation I think she would have felt better knowing that the doctors were considering both her and her child as equally valuable.

I had a similar experience when my husband was denied the chance to see our miscarried child on the ultrasound. But I think this was just because I had a crabby tech. LOL.

91,"&gt;What is the lowest level of risk that you would consider acceptable for an abortion?
&gt;What is the highest level of risk that you would consider unacceptable for an abortion?

I think that there has to be a serious and imminent possibility of extreme harm or death. I know that is pretty vague however, I don't think I am qualified to throw numbers around. I think that doctors and legislators ought to sit down to do this. Perhaps have a panel of doctors readily available to decide on each individual case (if time permits and I think generally it does). 

But in general, I would say financial burdens, emotional burdens, are not health related in the sense of allowing for violent self defense. 

For example, my ex boyfriend who broke up with me might live next door and his presence is making me depressed and suicidal but I still can not kill him. Heck, this would even apply to a rapist (as horrible as that is). His victims can not kill him even though his living may cause all kinds of trauma.

Another example, a born child may be causing huge financial burdens, making it next to impossible for me to finish school but I still can not kill him to alleviate this symptom. I can choose to make an adoption plan but must still provide for him while the process is underway.

Insofar as health I tend to use the example of getting stuck next to someone with the flu. My chances of getting it are pretty decent. And chances of health complications and even death are possible but, not enough to warrant killing.

However, if a kid is coming at me with a knife in a fit of rage and I do everything to defend myself without using unnecessary force but, in the end the only way to stop him results in his death then I'd say that is morally and legally justifiable.

So, to put it into context (from my limited knowledge on child birth), things like an ectopic pregnancy are clear as day. Things like preeclampsia or severe hypertension when medicine is failing also pretty clear. Debilitating nausea that poses no health threat and will most likely go away after some time is not a candidate but, every effort to provide other treatments must be made. 

As I mentioned before, I don't believe that there being a difficult grey area to navigate warrants us giving into abortion on demand and without apology. And the fact that other countries have worked out prolife legislation that works I'd say we have a great chance of finding a pretty good compromise.

Thank you for taking the time to respond about my sister. I know you are probably super busy and I won't give her any advice to be used in place of a doctor's visit (it's just really for my own understanding). In regards, she had the induction because the doctors told her if she continued on she would be at high risk for mirror syndrome and other complications. The background is that at 9 weeks they spotted some fluid. At 12 weeks it was really bad (hydrops). They suggested termination. She refused. Being prolife she wanted to carry as long as she could. They warned that if the baby is miscarried after 17 or 18 weeks because of her 3 previous Csections risk of complications would increase. Plus she had hydropic placenta. Every ultrasound demonstrated that the babies viability was less than 1% chance if any. At 16 weeks they scheduled an induction. No placenta accreta (it was a big subject discussed). She decided not to take either methotrexate or maybe it was misoprostol to treat the placenta that was left. She is hoping it will pass on it's own or get reabsorbed. 

Anyway, that is the gist of it. I just didn't really understand why they so adamantly want to avoid D and C. Apparently, this period of time after induction is more dangerous then when your uterus gets back to it's normal self after birth/induction. That's what she told me she was told anyway.

Re: your sister.

Giving medical advice online is dangerous, and I do not know you, your sister, or her medical situation.  All medical decisions should be made in consultation with a doctor who knows her full medical history, has access to her imaging, and has an opportunity to examine her.

That said.

I'm trying to piece together a story that makes sense from what you're telling me.  Maybe your sister had a placenta accreta?  She'd be at high-risk for that because she had three C-sections, and that's the scenario in which I could imagine watching a small focal accreta shrink instead of doing a D&amp;C to get it out.  Maybe also giving methotrexate in order to kill the placental tissue.

It might be helpful to know why she was induced at 17 weeks.

Generally speaking, my philosophy is that I try to make sure my patients are able to explain back to me the reasons behind the decisions we're making for their care.  Maybe your sister should ask her doctor the questions that you are asking me.",1,1479540148,2016-11-19 02:22:28

97,"&gt; We have seen it happen in the past with women, African Americans and Jews all being denied “personhood” status to justify the atrocities committed against them.

So this is what I would say to this:

Humans are a fundamentally tribal species, who have certain ingrained moral senses about who is ""like us"" (and therefore has moral value) and who is ""not like us"" (and therefore doesn't).  These moral senses also encourage us to structure our society hierarchically and give roles to various tribe members.  This makes it easy for men to see women as fundamentally different from them (and therefore entitled to a different, but not equivalent kind of moral care).

We now live in a global society, where these tribal impulses can have disastrous effects, and so from the time of the beginning of Judiasm to post-enlightenment, we have efforts to codify moral reasoning so that it can be applied more universally.  Racism, etc. is a result of the natural tribal instinct toward morally categorizing someone as ""other"" coming into conflict with the reality that we must all live in the same cities and attend the same public schools.  We have found that if we allow racism to run amok, we have war, strife, and genocide.

Protecting people who have long been classified as ""other"" and dehumanized for that is essential for living in peace with our neighbors, both in our communities and in the world.  This is a clear benefit to all of society, enough for society at large to be comfortable with insisting that most people feel like their thoughts, behaviors, and ingrained moral impulses are being second-guessed.  (Although, based on the recent election it seems that this is not something that society has truly settled on)

I do not see the same set of factors at play.  Being a fetus isn't an identity or even a societal role, its a developmental stage.  That everyone either grows out of, or dies first. So everyone experiences and can connect with.  Every mother that has children can similarly connect with what that is/means (and nearly all understand the fierce love one has for her offspring).

What group are we protecting against what group?  What is the tribal impulse we are trying to counteract?  What is the benefit to society from counteracting this problematic tribal moral impulse?

98,"&gt;And if my mom was in a fire and I had the chance to save her over 28 kids I would save her.

You would be given moral leniency to save her, that is, everyone would understand why you did and why you didn't save the kids, and the fact that it has to do with your emotional attachment and connection.  She's yours, and that makes her like an extension of you, and since you are under no moral obligation to save anyone, you are certainly under no obligation to save the kids over those that are an extension of you.  You would not, say, be given moral leniency if you chose to save a treasured photo album instead of a baby.  The photo album may be your most prized possession, but the fact that it is yours does not allow you to prioritize it over someone else's child (because the child is not morally equivalent to the photo album, it is worth much much more).  You would, however be *legally allowed* to save the photo album instead of the baby.

I am saying something different.  I am saying that even when it was weighted so that I would have every leniency given to me to focus on what is ""my own"" I would still never consider it.  The number is greater (7 vs 1), and the connection is between me and the blastocysts, not me and the baby. 

Since much of moral reasoning does in fact seem to start off as a gut impulse, which later becomes articulated and codified (for instance the distinction between acting and failing to act), I think that this points to an intuitive moral reasoning that does describe a distinction in moral value between my blastocysts and a baby that I've never met before.

I am also saying, not just that I would save the baby over the blastocysts, but that I challenge the idea that *anyone* with basic functioning moral sense, even those with more heightened reason to choose the blastocysts than me, would choose the baby over them.  Can you say that anyone with basic moral reasoning would choose their mother over 28 kids?  Or even one kid?  I wouldn't.  A person in that position would have full moral leniency to make whichever choice seemed best to that person at the time.

I wonder if you could say that you would save your own blastocysts (if you had any) instead of a baby you'd never seen before.  

I wonder if you could say that you would even grant moral leniency to someone who chose to save their own blastocysts instead of a baby.   Remember that I have looked at a blastocyst and that very blastocyst is now inside me at 15 weeks, growing and changing, and I hope every single day that that very blastocyst will become my child.  Yet I find that it would be really really difficult for me to grant moral leniency to someone who would choose a blastocyst over a baby.  

Perhaps it should be legal, but I couldn't understand it.

Also - in the cases of conjoined twins, we do not have courts weigh in to decide the outcome.  The outcome is determined with the parents and the doctors, based on accepted medical guidelines regarding viability.  We do not make it illegal to have certain medical interventions in an effort to protect one twin from the other.  We trust the people involved to the do the very best they can with murky and complex information, not to mention heartbreaking moral decisions.",1,1479495667,2016-11-18 14:01:07
99,"A parent is forced (legally) to provide for the ordinary needs of their child. The term ordinary means things that are normal for a child to need to survive at their age and stage of development. For example, all children need food, hydration and shelter. In the case of a fetuses they all need nourishment.  

An extraordinary need is one that goes beyond the norm for a child of a certain age. For example, the child needs an organ or blood. Or the fetuses needs an in utero transfusion. A parent does not have to do these things.

I think this is a great question. I believe that we need a cultural shift. We need universal health care, paid maternity leave, and government assistance paying for school. Perhaps a universal allowance to help families. 

Other things include safety laws to protect women and their children from abuse. Perhaps make tubal ligation a paid medical option for women who do not want to be pregnant. Of course, the option for men too.

100,"&gt;It is completely true.

I’m not sure what you are saying here? Are you denying the biological fact that an embryo is a living, human being/organism. If so, there is no way to move forward with this conversation because this is a scientific fact. 

However, if you are saying that an embryo is not morally equivalent to other human beings then there is room for discussion (despite the fact that I don’t agree).

&gt;You cannot say that a fertilized egg is morally equivalent to a baby. If I was in a fire with a baby I had never seen before and a thermos containing own blastocysts (7), and I could only save one or the other, I would save the baby every single day of the week and twice on Sunday. Even though they are my own, and there are 7, I would never for a moment consider them to be the moral equivalent of the baby. I would challenge that any person would save their own blastocysts over the baby that they have never met. Even women who desparately want their own children and have never had enough eggs to get one to fertilize (and burst into tears whenever they see someone else's baby). I have a lot of experiences looking at my own blastocysts and hoping that they might be children. And I think that anyone that would equate the two doesn't really know what they are talking about. The journey from blastocyst to baby is long and fraught, and plenty of pro-choicers would absolutely make a distinction in value.

And if my mom was in a fire and I had the chance to save her over 28 kids I would save her. That doesn’t mean that she is morally significant and they are not. This example is a red herring. Do you see what I’m saying?

&gt;Oftentimes, when prochoicers make this distinction, they do it in language that is discounting and offensive (i.e., calling it a ""clump of cells""). I definitely think it is far more valuable than any old clump of cells. But to compare its moral worth to a baby?? 

Well, the reality is that we are all just a clump of cells. That is really what we all are. Unless you are religious and I mean no offence if you are and you believe in a soul. But biologically and physically we are all just a clump of cells.

&gt;I think it requires a huge dedication to abstraction to do that. The fact that you don't want to draw lines because development is continuous, doesn't mean that the beginning and end are equivalent.

To be honest, this is the best point I’ve seen here. And I agree. But the prolifers point is that if we start to draw arbitrary lines based on people’s personal beliefs we have opened up a pandora’s box of human right violations. We have seen it happen in the past with women, African Americans and Jews all being denied “personhood” status to justify the atrocities committed against them. I really don’t see how discriminating against human fetuses because of their age, development or dependency is any different?

&gt;I agree that viability is subjective, and I believe that doctors are best equipped to make the determination of viability with regards to available resources.

I think doctor’s can do a great job of determining viability. That is not my point. It is subjective in the sense that it is your personal opinion that viability is a morally significant factor. You will have to justify why? If being dependent on another’s body eliminates a human being’s right to life then conjoined twins, newborn and life support patients can not have these rights either (if you are going to remain logically consistent).

&gt;because development is continuous,

I just want to quickly go back to this point because I think it will help create a bridge of understanding the embryology behind fertilization as the mark for a living, human organism beginning to exist. Think, when you say development is continuous, what is developing? In our case, we are talking about a living human organism. There is a point (biologically) when these three things converge (living, human and organism). And it is that point, to be fair, consistent and objective (to avoid discrimination and human rights violations) that human rights ought to be applicable.

It's that simple. If you can view human development along a spectrum, then you can see that where the line is drawn is most of the debate.

Two things. First a sperm cell is NOT an organism. Second, a sperm cell is not a distinct entity from it’s host organism (the male). So, no a sperm is not morally equivalent to an embryo. 

&gt;The existence of identical twins contradicts your assertion that a new human being begins to exist at conception. Identical twins don't. So how do you explain them and stay consistent with your assertion? If identical twins, two SEPARATE beings, weren't created AFTER conception, I'd say you had a point. but that's not the case.

Did I say new? I didn’t think I did. I think I said living, human being/organism. Plus distinct from his/her parent(s). As a side note, conjoined twins share the same dna but are still considered distinct human persons.

&gt;Pro choicer's aren't denying that an embryo is human. What else can they be, alien? Again, this argument is that an embryo is the equivalent of an adult human. And why? arbitrary reasons. Nobody is arguing that a zygote isn't human either. But why isn't it the same as an adult human?

As long as we can agree that biologically a human embryo is a living, human organism. And there is the understanding that this is different than a skin cell or an egg or a sperm then it’s fair to bring up the question about what makes a human organism morally significant. If there is a barrier in terms of the embryology involved that needs to be cleared up first or the conversation can not move forward imho. 

&gt;The pro life arguments just have too little consistency and too much contradiction. If zygotes are human beings, and destroying them is murder, then fertility clinics are committing genocide. Go after them instead.

I don't agree. I think prolife arguments are the most consistent. I think the problem arises via misunderstanding. I found that I also misunderstood aspects of the prochoice position until I started to ask around and open up to just understanding the viewpoint. 

So yes, most prolifers do not agree with freezing embryos as far as I know. There are some who argue that creating a new human being is not in itself a bad thing (since there is no killing happening here) but, agencies should ensure there will be someone or something available to them to give them a chance at life. So I guess in the former view a woman or an artificial incubator must be available. And perhaps no extra embryos should be created.

Hope this helps clear things up a bit. Feel free to fire me off anymore questions/concerns about prolife rhetoric.",1,1479485600,2016-11-18 11:13:20

Sorry but this is simply not true or there is some serious misunderstanding happening.

An embryo is living. An embryo is human. An embryo is an organism.

I don't see how the things you mention, likelihood of survival, differentiation and viability are morally significant.

That would be like me saying either a heartbeat, or the ability to talk, or health are what make a person a human being and morally significant.

Do you see how you are grabbing arbitrary conditions that meet your own personal and emotional criteria and then saying this is what makes a human being a valuable person (or morally significant)?

The fact is that biologically a new human organism begins to exist at fertilization. It's rare for even a pro choicer to deny this scientific fact.

If you want to discuss what characteristics make a living, human being valuable then that would be a whole other conversation. But to deny that an embryo is in fact a living human being is simply false. To thing conversation a prolifer would ask why we should accept your view on personhood over any other. 

For example, you might say personhood begins at viability while another would say a heartbeat. But the reality is that none of these developmental landmarks are objective. In fact they are arbitrary and inconsistent. If applied consistently they would deny personhood rights to newborn, severely disabled and other vulnerable groups.

&gt;Once it becomes viable, its very life is no longer contingent on the mother. This grants it the capability to live, which is morally significant indeed when you are determining who has which rights to whose organs.

110,"But I don't agree.  

I really don't believe that a fetus that is not fully developed has the same value as born person.  I do believe that the capacity to live without requiring the donation of another's organs is important, both legally and ethically.  I think that granting a ""right to life"" to something incapable of it is a stretch.  If it were to be given at no cost to another, that would be one thing, but it's not.  It is at the direct expense of the woman, and prevents all women (who can have their bodily autonomy rescinded throughout their young and mid-adult years) from achieving equal rights with men (who are never put in this position).  There, we will have to agree to disagree.

This view is further influenced by my experience among women who have struggled with infertility and multiple pregnancy losses.  Tell a woman undergoing multiple IVF cycles that you think each of her fertilized eggs=baby, and she will likely throttle you.  A friend of mine (who has yet to give birth despite years of heartbreak) said that if she lit candles for every chemical pregnancy and early miscarriage she's had, she would spend her whole life in church.  

For myself, I can guarantee you that when I learned that 6 of my fertilized eggs didn't make it to the stage where they could be either transferred to my uterus or frozen, I not only didn't grieve, or have six mini-funerals, I was entirely unconcerned.  I was too focused on the ones that had the *possibility* of being my children.  The idea that those arrested single cells are in any way equal to a baby is completely bizarre to me.  Now, the blastocysts I have on ice completely dim in comparison to the fetus I carry, and my hopes for her.  I never think of her as she is, I *always* think of her as what she will be.  So much of my understanding of her is my fantasies, hopes and dreams, and so little references what she currently is.  So it is similarly hard for me to imagine that I would ever place equal value on a fetus at this stage as I would on a born child.  That would be putting my fantasies and dreams on par with reality.

The fact that you think that my daughter is ""there"" is sweet, but I don't believe that it's founded in medicine, and I still don't want you making my medical decisions. I also don't believe that your belief on this makes you more qualified to either value her or make my medical decisions than me. Understand that she has great value, watching her on the ultrasound fills me with wonder, and I do believe that she is going through milestones, but I don't think that means that she is already a baby. She is still, developmentally, a fetus. If I were to have a miscarriage, I would be devastated. If I found that I needed to terminate for medical reasons I would be equally devastated. But knowing so many heartbreaking stories, I can't promise that I wouldn't.

Let's take the case of a single mother with two children who finds herself 6 weeks pregnant.  She has a history of preeclampsia and hyperemsis gravidarum during pregnancy, and if she were to be hospitalized, she would likely lose her job (she works for a small employer and is not protected by FMLA).  If she were to lose her salary, her family would lose access to their housing and become homeless.

I would value the life of the woman and her two born children to be much much higher than that of the embryo in her uterus.  If she chose to have an abortion, I would consider her decision to be a responsible action out of love for her two current children, and would be glad (through taxes or charity) to help her pay for that abortion.  I would also hope that she received birth control and counseling to prevent such an occurrence from happening again.  She would get nothing but sympathy from me, as she attempts to negotiate life and fulfill her responsibilities. I would not seek to shame her for having sex at all, and would not consider putting her life, livelihood, and the lives and development of her children to be a warranted consequences for whatever actions she did or didn't make to find herself in this position.

Is it really your call that she MUST endanger the lives of her children, or sacrifice them to foster care because *you* have such a strong value on her fetus?  What do you think she must do to prove that the risk to her life is substantial enough to allow her to make these decisions? How would you write the law to include the additional risk to her children? Abortion always involves the risks incurred by multiple people.

Would you be in favor of supporting abortion prior to 12 weeks (like most developed nations) in return for further restrictions after 12 weeks?  (I'm not sure that I would agree, but I'm curious).  Also, Ireland and Poland are widely regarded in Europe as having excessive and draconian abortion restrictions.  Women there typically travel to other parts of Europe if they wish to obtain an abortion.

&gt;And prolife legislation would always make an exception for this.

But that doesn't mean that the cost and risk of pregnancy aren't a part of A-D's decision. My point is that it's a matter of scale. Am I making any sense? I feel like I'm struggling to phrase this.

I think I can agree that there is a scale. I see  what you are saying. I just think that in order to qualify for an abortion you really need to be on one end and not the other since we are talking about killing another person as a solution.

115,"&gt;In most cases, this is easy to determine. But not in pregnancy. Because there is no way to be passive with regards to your own body.

I agree that this becomes more of a difficult area to navigate but, if the preborn child/human fetus is in fact a living human being with equal worth and rights it seems that we must try to protect them both (mother and fetus).

&gt;hyperemesis gravidarum (which a woman may be hospitalized for) is probably mifepristone and misoprostol.

I don’t think I can agree here though. I think there are better ways to manage this. I believe that during weeks 4-6 and 9-12 a woman is most likely to suffer from this. Here is the thinking behind why I can’t agree (unless the nausea was so bad and became seriously threatening). Here is an example, I am a mom. Last year my daughter got the flu. She was sick for over a week. Then, I got it, my husband and then my other child. It was 4 weeks of fever, nausea, throwing up etc. At one point I was so dehydrated I thought I would have to go to the hospital and be hooked up to an IV. Had there been an option for me to avoid this horrendous experience by killing one of the children, I think we can all agree that not only would that action have been immoral to take, it would also have been illegal. This might not be the best example but I think you can see where I am going. I don’t see the difference between the outlined flu experience and abortion (killing) to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.

However, for the sake of the discussion would you accept a ban on abortion except in cases of health and life of the mother. Where a panel of available doctors review and decide if the abortion is considered theraputic and allow for those cases?
 
&gt;I also appreciate the conversation, although I wouldn't say that I'm satisfied that we have fully discussed the costs to the mother of being forced to give birth against her will. That strikes me as every bit as intuitively invasive, violent and immoral as your description of abortion.

I think I can see your point here. And I know that pregnancy is no walk in the park for many women. I don’t deny this. However, I don’t think it is a fair comparison. If we eliminate high risk pregnancies than I think death is a much harsher sentence and we must weigh out both person’s rights. I think the real issue is probably the fact that I view the preborn child as a human person and you most likely do not.

&gt;What are the costs of criminalizing abortion to the woman who miscarries? Should every miscarriage be investigated for murder? 

I don’t think that this would be a problem in a developed nation with prolife legislation. People die of natural causes every minute and there are no investigations. In fact, most prolifers agree that it is the abortionist who ought to be charged.

&gt;You say that its shouldn't be a criminal offense to smoke while pregnant, but due to pro-life laws, women are jailed for substance abuse that took place during their pregnancies. 

If the substance was something like mifepristone or misoprostol and meant to kill than I can see there being an issue but, I’ve never heard of this in any recent prolife developed nation.

&gt;Medical decisions need to be made quickly and carefully, and no law could ever be written to reflect their complexity. You never know beforehand what will actually happen, so risk to life is always a set of odds.

I don’t think I agree here though. Most of the rest of the world restricts abortion already. All we need to do is use a model from a developed prolife nation. I think Europe bans abortion after 12 weeks. Ireland and Poland have restrictions with the exception of the life of the mother and there maternal rates are much higher than the rest of the world. Usually when a pregnancy is in a high risk category it is known beforehand and there is time to deliberate. There are cases of hypertension onset which comes quickly and it would be easy to make legislation to account for the hard cases.
 
&gt;I went through a lot to be pregnant and couldn't be happier to make the sacrifices that I make. 

Congratulations! I wish you and your family all the best.

&gt;I am so excited to meet her, but I know that she isn't really ""there"" yet. In my imagination she is already finished, not the work-in-progress that she is currently.

I think she is there. The truth is that even after she is born she will continue to grow and develop. Her first acknowledgement of self in the mirror, her first smile, her first word, her first step, her first tooth are all just new milestones. Just like her first nerve signal, her first dream, her first blink, her first heartbeat, her first fingernail are all milestones. The latter just happen in your uterus while the former outside. 

&gt;If there were a conflict between her life and my health, my husband would probably be quicker than I to endorse abortion simply because he is so terrified of losing me.

And prolife legislation would always make an exception for this.

127,"&gt; And it's that the life worth preserving is not the current life of the fetus, but rather the potential life it contains.

That's exactly the reason why I'm a pro-choicer; the potential of something doesn't justify adults being obligated to alter the **results** they've already achieved, the people they already are, unless **they** want to. They are independent and autonomous and can give back to society; a baby can't give to anyone, but abstractly to its parents, until it grows up enough. So to me that potential is fine and dandy, but it's abstract. Existing people are concrete. The potential baby will always come last; saving a newborn from a burning building doesn't make sense when you can save a 10-year-old instead.

And life beginning at conception, even human life, is never going to be enough to convince those who **don't** define life that way. You guys keep saying that as though it's inherently true; but it's just your opinions, or a biological definition. Nature and biology alone don't determine who we are, as humans. (They do for the baby until it becomes more than a totally dependent entity, which it really isn't, especially even after birth.)

What you've said isn't sufficient. ""Life begins at conception"" isn't enough, and isn't correct unless you're all about the biology of things, in which case all your arguments can be tossed out; potential is a philosophical issue.

141,"&gt;In terms of my child on life support, I really don't think the law would have allowed her to be off life support nor can I imagine there being a doctor who would advocate for her removal.

Certainly you know your own situation.  However, I would say that if you *were* in a situation where there was agreement with the doctor (as you said, there wouldn't be if there were a chance for decently quality of life) then a court wouldn't intervene.  Doctors know quite a lot about viability, suffering and potential quality of life.  And they themselves tend to choose lower rates of medical interventions than the general public.  We need to trust families and their doctors to make difficult judgment calls without fear of legal recrimination.  And we DO, for the most part.

If you are to make the distinction between active and passive killing, you need to be able to identify what is active behavior and what is passive behavior.  In most cases, this is easy to determine.  But not in pregnancy.  Because there is no way to be passive with regards to your own body.  And there are too many ways a woman might act to cause a miscarriage that involve her taking care of her own body and responsibilities.  Pregnancy always involves violence toward the mother.  The first thing a fetus does is tear lawnmower style into her uterine wall to create pools of blood for nourishment.  Then it emits hormones into her bloodstream to make her feel nauseated and suppress her immune system.  This happens in every pregnancy.    The best, most effective treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (which a woman may be hospitalized for) is probably mifepristone and misoprostol.

Women who are happily pregnant suspend many activities large and small, incur great physical costs throughout the pregnancy, and take positive action (e.g., seeking prenatal care) to protect the health of their pregnancy.  Up to 15% of pregnancies contain complications that could be life-threatening if proper medical care is not sought, so this behavior is fairly necessary.

I also appreciate the conversation, although I wouldn't say that I'm satisfied that we have fully discussed the costs to the mother of being forced to give birth against her will.  That strikes me as every bit as intuitively invasive, violent and immoral as your description of abortion.  I don't think that pro-lifers are horrible people, but I do wonder at why they fail to notice or even discuss how invasive their policies would be in a woman's life. 

Once we get to that point, I would like you to keep in mind the practicality of outlawing abortion.  Women don't just have a legal right to their bodies, they have a practical right.  That is, they are often unsupervised with their bodies, and may choose to abort at any time with medical care or without.  Women around the world and across time have in fact chosen abortion regardless as to its legality and will likely continue to do so.

What are the costs of criminalizing abortion to the woman who miscarries?  Should every miscarriage be investigated for murder?  I know a number of women who have had multiple miscarriages, and can only imagine the pain, suffering, and guilt made worse by being interrogated as to whether or not you took any action to cause it.

You say that its shouldn't be a criminal offense to smoke while pregnant, but due to pro-life laws, women *are* jailed for substance abuse that took place during their pregnancies.  Considering what we know about addiction, this is literally sending someone to jail for murder because they are sick.  It also ends up being a way of criminalizing women who are poor and lack the resources to get the help that they need.  (While denying them the capacity to end the pregnancy before a child is suffering/dying).

In a practical way, when courts do intervene, they sometimes make the wrong decision and increase medical complications and potential death for women (attempting to preserve fetal life by insisting on interventions with higher complication rates or denying timely intervention that would avoid sepsis/heart failure).  Medical decisions need to be made quickly and carefully, and no law could ever be written to reflect their complexity.  You never know beforehand what will actually happen, so risk to life is always a set of odds.  Is 90% chance of maternal death sufficient to act?  50%?  20%?  5%  Women and their doctors may also make the ""wrong"" decision, but at least they are the ones closest to the situation, and the ones who will need to live (or die) with the outcome.

I am a currently pregnant woman who celebrates each new milestone for my fetus with great joy.  I went through a lot to be pregnant and couldn't be happier to make the sacrifices that I make.  Yet I don't think I am *required* to make these sacrifices.  I make them joyfully, as the best, most amazing gift I can give my future daughter.  I am similarly not required to let her destroy me, and I don't think that there could ever be anyone else (outside of my doctors) who would care as much about her potential for life as I do.  I am so excited to meet her, but I know that she isn't really ""there"" yet.  In my imagination she is already finished, not the work-in-progress that she is currently.  But she is so exciting to me, even if she does need me to loan her life for another six months.  If there were a conflict between her life and my health, my husband would probably be quicker than I to endorse abortion simply because he is so terrified of losing me.   This is my life and my family, not yours and not anybody else's.  I completely reject that a court has any business weighing in on any of my medical decisions.

And it's that the life worth preserving is not the current life of the fetus, but rather the potential life it contains. Let's re-examine the philosophical meaning of ""murder"":

Murder is not the destruction of a lived life, but rather the destruction of a yet-to-be-lived life. You can't undo the life a person has already lived. You can only prevent them from living further life. That is what's being taken away when you commit murder.

Now, a sperm cell, on its own, cannot become a human without coming into contact with an egg cell. And thus, termination of sperm is not murder, because it had no potential to live a human life. But a zygote/embryo does. A zygote/embryo, if left unharmed, WILL develop into a human, and by terminating that, you're thus terminating the human life it would have otherwise become.

147,"First off, thank you for the civil discussion. Sometimes it doesn't go that way with this topic so I appreciate it.

The hypothetical situation is really suppose to demonstrate how the law does in fact require parents to act via parental responsibility. For example, if a mother gives birth in a back alley and leaves her child to die she will be criminally charged because by law she is required to provide for the child's ordinary needs (food, hydration, shelter). Even if that means using her body to keep that child safe. 

It's also suppose to show how despite the dependency of one person on the other, killing the more dependent person is not legal (conjoined twins was the example here I think).

In terms of my child on life support, I really don't think the law would have allowed her to be off life support nor can I imagine there being a doctor who would advocate for her removal. I'm pretty sure that for that to be an issue she would have had to be brain dead or in a persistent vegetative state. Perhaps have severe brain damage. I could be wrong here though.

&gt;I disagree that being pregnant is ""inaction.""

I really didn't say this though. I was outlining the different type of rights. The right to life (or the right to not be killed) is a negative right. Negative rights oblige inaction from others. In the case of the mother/fetus the mother is obliged to not act in a way that will directly kill the fetus. As a side note, children also have positive rights (oblige action). That is they have a right to be feed, hydrated and sheltered by their parents under parental responsibility law.
 
Here is an example, parents can smoke around their born children despite the fact that it causes lung cancer but, they can not throw their child who can not swim into a pool and leave him or her to die. The former is legal, the latter is murder because of the difference between these types of rights. 

So I think the line would be pretty clear. Of course you can smoke while pregnant, skip on prenatals and eat junk (not that I think you should). Just like you can smoke around your born children, feed them junk food and skip on their vitamins. But you can not stab them, or throw them outside and let them freeze to death. Just like you shouldn't be allowed to, suction them, poison, burn them or evacuate them post viability (with the exception for the life of the mother of course which is more a case of self defense if anything.

158,"&gt;There is something to back that up though. Personhood is a legal status, at least when we're talking about civil rights. In this context, isn't a synonym with alive or human. That's why non-human persons exist, and that's also why human non-persons exist. They clearly don't mean the same thing when speaking of legal rights.

Right but I'm arguing morally here, not legally.  If personhood is a legal status then obviously pro-lifers are of the opinion that a fetus should fall under the umbrella of ""person"".  You can't point out the current definition according to the law and use that as an argument for why it should be the law.  If we had this discussion a few years ago I could say that gay marriage is clearly wrong because, look, the law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, clearly gay marriage doesn't count and should be illegal.  Not too long ago I could accurately point out that according to the law, black people are only 3/5 of a total person, so obviously they shouldn't have the same rights as us white folk.

 &gt;What I'm curious about is why pro lifers want to give fetuses not equal rights, but special rights. You're without a doubt alive, human, aware, sentient, an individual, a person. But you have absolutely no right to use my body for anything, even if doing so was the only thing on earth that would keep you alive. Why then should a fetus that, granted is alive and human, but is none of those other things, be allowed to do what any living person cannot?

There are times when your right to bodily autonomy is superseded by another's right to life. Having children, for example. If you have a child you are without a doubt obligated to provide for it for 18 years, no argument of bodily autonomy will get someone out of paying for child support or get someone out of feeding their kids. You wouldn't ask why an infant has ""special rights"" and wish to remove them. At least I'd hope not.",1,1479326029,2016-11-16 14:53:49
159,"You completely misunderstood the point I was making.

&gt;If you intentionally left a two-year old alone in the woods despite having readily available capacity to legally transfer caregiving for that child, of course you would be prosecuted.

Why should I be prosecuted? Up above you said this:

&gt;If you think that no one has told you, its because you haven't been listening. It happens at viability, or when the fetus can live on its own. Before viability whatever life it has is on loan from the mother. After viability, it is capable of exercising a right to life without further demand on the mother's body.

That was your definition for a human that has the right to life.  When it can live on its own.  I was pointing out that this cannot be the true definition for what makes a human a human, since a 1 month old baby cannot live on its own.  A 1 year old cannot live on its own, even a 2 year old that I abandon in the woods is going to die without anyone to help it.  If these cannot live on their own, then by your definition, they are not human and I should be able to kill them with no consequences because they aren't humans with a right to life. That's why defining a human is much more complicated than you made it seem.

&gt;Right to life certainly expands with growing medical technology and growing willingness of society to provide medical intervention.

I don't see how this could possibly be true.  Every human has a right to life, no? How could this ever change with technology? Humans have a right to life, all of them. This is one of the most basic core values of civilization, you cannot just kill people.

&gt;This is clearly true: A person only has a right to life in the face of a heart attack insofar as treatment for cardiac arrest exists and he is capable of using it to survive the heart attack. He doesn't have a right to medical interventions that don't yet exist (even if they would save him). He doesn't get to demand another person's heart as a stopgap for medical interventions that don't exist.

Of course he doesn't have a right to medical tech that doesn't exist yet, but he has a right to life.  If he's having a heart attack people are morally obligated to help him in any way that they can, and nobody could walk up to him and shoot him in the head because that would be easier than saving him or watching him struggle, even if he was bleeding out on the operating table with a 99% chance of death, one of the doctors couldn't just slit his throat to make things quicker.  A human's right to life does not change based on our medical tech, just our ability to save people from death.  Humans had a right to life a hundred years ago, they do now, and they will a hundred years from now. In the future we may be able to remove the fetus without killing it and let it grow in an artificial womb but for the time being, removing it will kill it and you cannot kill humans.",1,1479323796,2016-11-16 14:16:36

167,"I think that if a woman gave birth, was completely isolated in a remote cabin and unable to access help, and failed to care for her newborn, and the child subsequently died, it would be a great tragedy, but that she would be unlikely to face criminal prosecution.  Babies die from failure to thrive even if they aren't withheld nourishment, and whether she tried to feed him and failed, or never tried to feed him, would be knowable only to herself.  What would a court have to investigate?  Wouldn't they be as likely to find themselves arresting a woman who tried but failed, and kept saying ""its all my fault, I didn't feed him"" as arresting someone who maliciously withheld nourishment?  That woman will need to live with what happened during those days for the rest of her life.  More than that would require criminalizing pregnancy and childbirth itself.

I am sorry that you were in a situation that caused you to fear for your child's life.  I'm glad that she made it.  When I say breathing, I am not talking about an analogy.  I am talking about what is often the key last piece of fetal development and the main determinant of whether a fetus will survive birth.  Sorry if that is a sensitive issue for you.

To speak to your situation, understand that if you, and your child's other parent, and her doctors had made the determination that your child should be removed from life support during the time that she couldn't breathe, courts would have no reason to weigh in.  That is a decision you as parents can make.  While I agree that such scenarios may be heartbreaking, we tend to leave the decision-making to those closest to the situation (in this case you and the doctors) and not up to arbitrary laws.

I disagree that being pregnant is ""inaction.""  I don't believe it is possible to be inactive with regards to one's own body.  When you are living in your body, you are making constant decisions about the food and chemicals you put into it, the risks that you expose it to and how to respond to medical symptoms that you can experience.  What type of food or drink must the ""inactive"" person consume/not consume?  Alcohol? Herbs?  What type of medication?  Must the ""inactive"" person go off of psychotropic medications that allow for her to live and work?  Can she move forward with cancer treatment?  Is the ""inactive"" person allowed to continue work as a stunt double or boxer?  Must she stay out of hot tubs?  Is she allowed to continue breastfeeding a current child?  The list of dos and don'ts goes on and on.

Categorizing pregnancy and childbirth as ""inaction"" puts the woman in the bizarre role of bystander inside her own body. (Even while she performs the amazing feat of labor!  A bystander??)  She has a responsibility to herself to care for her body and to make sure that it is healthy, work to support herself (likely), attempt to achieve her goals, and possibly use her body to care for her current children.  If she attempts to be ""inactive"" she may not be able to fulfill the responsibilities that she already has.  Abandoning responsibilities that she has freely accepted as hers is not morally justified simply because she is ""inactive"".  But very often she must sacrifice these responsibilities, if she is to remain pregnant, or carry to term a healthy baby.  She isn't a bystander, and is unable to be inactive.  And she is the one best poised to understand these responsibilities and how they may/may not be met.",1,1479318944,2016-11-16 12:55:44

170,"&gt;There are clearly a few differences, one is that parental rights and responsibilities to a two-year old can be relinquished and transferred, and there are in fact legal structures to do so. The two-year old lives independently of its mother. If a mother dies, for instance, the child does not necessarily die - any number of people might care for it. The two-year-old (or even the newborn) may even be able to solicit care from other people who notice it (so long as it encounters a potential caregiver quickly). But the same is not true for a fetus.

As a prolifer I would ask you to imagine a scenario where the responsibility can not be transferred to anyone else for sometime. Take conjoined twins for example or a mother who gives birth in a remote cabin and is snow bound. In both scenarios the law still requires you to abstain from killing. In the latter, the law requires that you still provide for your child’s ordinary needs (food, hydration, shelter) as best you can.

&gt;Giving a fetus a right to life on the other hand is giving it a right to something it is incapable of. Perhaps a noble idea, but nonsensical at its core. A fetus cannot live. That's what nonviable means. It can only do so at some point in the future - once it's finished being created by its mother. Until the day it breathes, whatever life it has is on loan from its mother. We know this because when a nonviable fetus's mother dies, it necessarily dies as well. There is no rescuing from the well-intentioned passerby (or highly trained doctor).

I really take issue with this breathing analogy. My child was on life support at birth because she couldn’t breathe on her own and yet, I still had no right to kill her. You will have to be more specific here. 

&gt;So, in order to grant this ""right-to-life"" to a fetus you must grant it not just its own life, but right to its mother as well (right to her body as well as disrupting her right to self-determination, health, etc). And this is where you cross a line.

The right to life is a negative right meaning the right to not be killed. It requires inaction from others. Many prolifers would argue that consensual sex places parents in a position of responsibility.

&gt;Born people (even newborns) typically don't require another specific person's body to survive.

Imagine the hypothetical scenarios proposed above where they do require another specific person and we still can not legally or morally kill. 

&gt;The exceptions include people requiring organ donation/transplant. In those cases, we prioritize bodily autonomy over right to life. Always. 

The organ donor example is not analogous to abortion. Donation would require a positive right (obliges action). It’s the difference between the law forcing me to donate my bread to the starving man on the street (positive right) as opposed to preventing me from stealing his last crumbs (negative right). They won’t do the latter but will enforce the former. In the same way, I do not need to donate organs but I still can not kill. If you want me to explain further let me know. 

&gt;Dying people are also not considered to have a right to life that exceeds their capacity to live (with whatever medical interventions that society has agreed to share the costs for). The fact that they could live in the past, has no bearing on their current right to life. They have a right to live as much as they can. A fetus, similarly, has only the right to life that it is capable of.

I am not sure how this is relevant? We still can not kill a dying person but the fetus is killed.

That’s unfortunate. I’ve had some good conversations about this. In fact, I usually start by pointing out that the rest of the world is very restrictive when it comes to abortion. In fact, most of Europe bans abortion after the 12th week (with life of the mother exception) and other developed pro life nations have the highest maternal rates.

174,"That definition doesn't hold up logically.  A fetus isn't a person until it can live on it's own? What does that mean? A 1 month old baby can't live on its own, is that not a human? I could leave a 2 year old kid alone in the woods and it couldn't live on its own, so its not human?

 Also with regards to the fetus, aren't you then saying that the definition of when a human becomes a human changes based on our current medical tech? A hundred years ago we didn't have incubators, if a fetus was born prematurely it would surely die.  So they weren't human, by your definition.  But now we have incubators that can save premature babies.  So now they are human? What about a hundred years from now if we have full artificial wombs that work from conception to birth, is that a human the whole time since it's always viable outside the mother? If your definition of what a human is literally changes depending on what year it is, do you really think that it's a good definition?

I've seen that explanation for when it becomes a human before and it clearly doesn't hold up.

179,"It's an interesting way you phrase it.

&gt;I am pretty sure that OBGYNs already place women in low and high risk categories during pregnancy.

We do, yeah, for a lot of reasons.  A large OB clinic may have patients who are seen by midwives, patients who are seen by OBs, and then patients who are seen by OBs who have completed an MFM (maternofetal medicine) fellowship.  Or we might have patients in labor who are managed by midwives while other patients are managed by MDs.  Sometimes we call that high-risk vs. low-risk.

So in that sense, sure, we cross some lines between A-D and E.  I could have phrased that better.  Let me abandon the ""line"" phrasing and say it instead like this:

A-D are all saying, ""I have compared the cost and risk that pregnancy presents to me.  I have subtracted it from my current desire to give birth to a child.  I have then compared all of that to how I feel about having an abortion.  I have decided to have an abortion.""

The biggest difference is that for A-D, most of what drove their decision was a low desire to have a child, whereas for E the cost and risk of pregnancy was the driving factor.  But that doesn't mean that the cost and risk of pregnancy aren't a part of A-D's decision.

My point is that it's a matter of scale.

Am I making any sense?  I feel like I'm struggling to phrase this.  I also should sleep.

Everyone seems to know that you should NOT kill babies, right? That's clearly murder.  And most people seem to agree that two cells meeting isn't a human either... so when does it happen? Since we don't know, lots of people seem to just make up their own arbitrary timeline, like that you can abort until 4 months, then its illegal, or you can abort until it has fingernails, or until its got a heartbeat etc.  There is no scientific point where we become human.  Because of this, I personally morally felt that the right thing to do is err on the side of caution and decide that life starts at conception, since that's when the unique genetic code that makes you You comes into play.  That's the moment you are now set for life in this universe, and I haven't seen any better arguments for a different time.

I'm not against supporting kids in foster care, I was using that as an example to point out your own logic since you said that:

I answered above why I chose conception, and since you have a different opinion, that's why were discussing it.

&gt;Yet, all they take into their equation is the biological definition of life, and they care nothing for actual life as in the ~70+ years and thousands upon thousands of experiences we all go through on Earth.

I don't see what the point of this is either. Humans that are already born have the right to life, you can't just kill people. It's already illegal and if you do it you go to jail.  Nobody needs to get out there and fight to stop murders, we are all already on board.  Pro-lifers are fighting to stop the murder of what they believe to be living humans who have a right to life but are being killed anyway.

You have presented no facts that disprove the pro-life point of view that a fetus is a human deserving of the right to life.

&gt;To answer your question though, I think it's much more wasteful to kill a person that's already somewhat able to survive by itself, than a baby that isn't or is so newly born it makes no difference.

How's it wasteful at all? If anything its much less wasteful to kill off any unwanted kids in foster care rather than make society support them with money/food/water/resources/education/etc for as long as they live.

&gt;I do think it matters more to avoid making the foster care situation worse, or even to maintain it as-is. That number needs to go down. It can't go down if people keep being irrational about allowing unwanted children to be born.

To answer your question though, I think it's much more wasteful to kill a person that's already somewhat able to survive by itself, than a baby that isn't or is so newly born it makes no difference. There is much more suffering involved than in aborting a baby, since most kids still in foster care after years stay there until they're 18. They have a much more developed frame of reference for what would be happening to them. They would probably fight it if they knew. A baby can't fight anything, it doesn't know how and doesn't know to even care. Moreso in the womb, it can't even scream; and like I said a couple posts ago, the only issue I see with abortion is ensuring it's done painlessly. If it isn't, that's a major problem to be addressed so it can be pain-free.

192,"There are clearly a few differences, one is that parental rights and responsibilities to a two-year old can be relinquished and transferred, and there are in fact legal structures to do so.  The two-year old lives independently of its mother.  If a mother dies, for instance, the child does not necessarily die - any number of people might care for it.  The two-year-old (or even the newborn) may even be able to solicit care from other people who notice it (so long as it encounters a potential caregiver quickly).  But the same is not true for a fetus.

Giving a fetus a right to life on the other hand is giving it a right to something it is incapable of.  Perhaps a noble idea, but nonsensical at its core.  A fetus cannot live.  That's what nonviable means.  It can only do so at some point in the future - once it's finished being created by its mother.  Until the day it breathes, whatever life it has is on loan from its mother.  We know this because when a nonviable fetus's mother dies, it necessarily dies as well.  There is no rescuing from the well-intentioned passerby (or highly trained doctor).

So, in order to grant this ""right-to-life"" to a fetus you must grant it not just its own life, but right to its mother as well (right to her body as well as disrupting her right to self-determination, health, etc).  And this is where you cross a line.  

Born people (even newborns) typically don't *require* another specific person's body to survive.  The exceptions include people requiring organ donation/transplant.  In those cases, we prioritize bodily autonomy over right to life.  Always.  Dying people are also not considered to have a right to life that exceeds their capacity to live (with whatever medical interventions that society has agreed to share the costs for).  The fact that they could live in the past, has no bearing on their current right to life.  They have a right to live as much as they can.

199,"What gives you that faith?  I don't.  Here's why:

- We have pro-life laws against researching it.

- After the first few weeks, it would require separating the fetus/placenta from a woman's arterial blood supply, and then reattaching the fetus (and placenta??  This is half-made from the host mother's DNA and would be rejected),  to a different woman's arterial blood supply.  While I don't know anatomy that well, I would guess this is much more complex than a heart transplant (where there is only one living patient instead of three).  The connection here is different than that in any other mammal, so it wouldn't help to do animal research.

- A womb begins to grow and change from the moment that the fetus implants.  The recipient mother's womb would not have gone through those changes, and it would be hard to trigger the womb to make those changes without there being a fetus in there already.  

- The recipient mother's body will not have been receiving the immunosuppressant chemicals that the fetus has been putting into the host mother's blood stream.  Like any transplant, there is a strong likelihood of organ rejection, except in this case, the woman wouldn't be able to take most medications because of the potential harm to the fetus.

I understand wanting to come up with a win-win-win solution, and I think that's admirable, but we are a long long long way off.  And the first step would be allowing research on embryo and fetal tissue.  But even then - best case scenario, we would have a procedure that was costly and dangerous for both women involved.  The benefit to the host would be essentially nil, and the benefit to the recipient woman would be much less than if she had simply implanted a 5-6 day blastocyst that was leftover from IVF cycles.",4,1479251352,2016-11-15 18:09:12

I don't think that the purpose of this thread is to argue with pro-lifers, but rather to discuss strategy amongst pro-choicers.  I am not going to get into a long discussion about why personhood or ""human rights"" applied to fetuses wouldn't negate the bodily autonomy of a woman.  Please see other threads for that.  On those threads I am more than happy to discuss embryology with you.

__________

My frustration is that in my view pro-choicers do not make arguments that appeal to people's emotional reasoning.  Pro-lifers do.  Yes, including shaming - specifically slut-shaming women for wanting control over their own bodies or for failing to feel sufficient regret. They have moral outrage over women having unsanctioned sex that heightens their response to women's desire for bodily autonomy.  Well, I have moral outrage for men that feel entitled to women's bodies.

I believe pro-lifers are good people who live in a sexist society that teaches them that women and their bodies can be discounted, controlled, and disrespected.  This systemic cultural disrespect allows people who would otherwise intuitively understand why the pro-life position is wrong to fail to see how intrinsically invasive and controlling it is, *because they just can't see the woman in the picture* (e.g., denying that babies come from mothers).  I have yet to see a pro-lifer that was willing to honestly engage in a fact-based conversation about what they believe the cost of forced pregnancy and childbirth is to a woman.  That part of the equation is systematically discounted.  They'd rather talk about personhood (see your comment).

Moreover, we as pro-choicers need to connect to people's intuitive understanding of morality, and most people  DO respect their mother's bodies.  So, we (pro-choicers) need people to understand on an emotional level that they are trying to exert unwelcome control over not just a woman's, but a potential mother's body, and that the demand that they are insisting that a fetus make on its mother's body is one that they would feel guilty making on their own mother.",1,1479246122,2016-11-15 16:42:02

Also, I think you may be misinterpreting the prolife position. It is generally accepted among prolifers that personhood restrictions are arbitrary and inconsistent.  Many of the proposed 
criteria would, if applied consistently, deny the personhood of newborns, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. This is why we advocate the use of the most objective tool we have, that is, science (embryology).

212,"&gt;You phrase it as though there is an obvious line that has been crossed between A-D and E. There is no such line.

I think there is a pretty clear legal (should say medical) line here though. I may be wrong but I think mathematically a 50% chance of death during a pregnancy has put you in a high risk category.

I am pretty sure that OBGYNs already place women in low and high risk categories during pregnancy.

I feel like only E would fit the latter. You would be able to confirm as I think you are an OB right?

&gt;Apparently the likelihood of death for E has passed your personal cut-off for when it's acceptable to offer termination.

I wouldn't say that. I think any doctor would place E in a high risk category. 

Look, I've been pregnant a few times and never once was high risk. My sister's been pregnant 5 times. Only one of those times was high risk. In fact, she had to have an early induction and it was terribly emotional for her. 

Anyway, the point I am making is that I think doctors would have no problem drawing a line. There may be grey areas that need navigating but A-D are not in them. What they need is proper social services to help them out of their unwanted circumstances.

I don't deny that there is a complex grey area but I just don't think that is enough of reason to hand over the reigns of abortion on demand and without apology.

219,"I think you're confused. 

Embryos that are donated are created through IVF and frozen before day 7 after fertilization.  These embryos have never been in a woman's body. 

This works because Day 6 blastocysts are still undifferentiated enough that cell loss through freezing/thawing does not typically disrupt development.  They are microscopic, so I have no idea how we would be able to find or collect a blastocyst made ""naturally"". 

But these are not in any way pregnancies. Even in nature a 5- or 6-day blastocyst has never implanted in a uterine wall and thus has never been part of a pregnancy. Quite literally she doesn't know that she's pregnant because *she's* not. 

Women who are trying to conceive and anxiously test do not find out they are pregnant for another week after fertilization-after it has implanted in the uterine wall. 

In order for embryo donation to be a solution to abortion, we would have to have the technology to remove the embryo from the uterus and put it into either a artificial womb (doesn't exist) or another woman (no such thing as a fetal transplant).

First of all, only about 1:1000 sexual acts results in a birth. Compared to most species, humans are bad at sex for reproduction, and great at using sex for intimate bonding. I don't think that it's reasonable to assume that someone who did something with a .1% chance of creating a dependency is quite that certainly responsible. 

Secondly, what is most offensive to me about the pro-life position is the erasure of the pregnant woman and even the process of pregnancy herself. Her needs and the costs that she may incur are not even taken into account ( you will see prol-lifers minimizing pregnancy at every turn), and neither is the medical unpredictability of pregnancy. 

Tell a woman with 6 failed IVF cycles how a fertilized egg is the same as a child and she will likely throttle you.  Part of what's offensive about defining embryos as people is it uses the hopes and dreams of some ( who want their fetuses to be babies and so call them as such like how a proud mother whose son just got accepted to law school may be forgiven for calling him "" a lawyer"") to control others, while erasing the danger, the unpredictability and the costs of the miracle of pregnancy and birth. 

I think many men don't want to think about how amazing women's procreative power truly is, and by defining a fertilized egg as a person, they indicate that the important contribution is *theirs*.

I think we need to be willing to elevate women, and insist that pro-lifers acknowledge that babies *only come from mothers*.

This law seems very strange. Also abhorrent. But very strange in that they're trying to go after doctors, alongside women. The woman doesn't have to say why she wants the abortion and there's no way to prove its for one of those reasons.

You phrase it as though there is an obvious line that has been crossed between A-D and E.  There is no such line.  And I would never describe E's situation as ""demanding medical intervention.""  We (her doctors) would certainly be remiss in not offering her medical intervention, but we would also be remiss in telling her the situation demanded medical intervention.

E could reasonably decide that she wanted to risk her life in order to have one more child.  I have known people to make that decision.

&gt; an imminent and highly possible threat.

Death with pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy typically occurs after delivery, so her threat is just as imminent as it is for A-D (who, in absence of other risk factors, face hemorrhage as their most likely cause of death).

I don't know what ""highly possible"" means -- things are possible or they aren't.  It is certainly more *probable* for E to die than for A-D to die.  Apparently the likelihood of death for E has passed your personal cut-off for when it's acceptable to offer termination.

251,"&gt; pursue... more accurate depiction

Looking back I see that I wrote ""most honest.""  Again, perhaps it would have been most accurate for me to write ""least contentious.""  I do think that ""need"" is a fine word to use.  We say that people need housing, for example, because their quality of life is substantially worse without access to housing.

&gt; (E)['s] ""need"" ... can not be met by any other means except the abortion procedure.

I think it's important to remember that, although people identify a great variety of reasons for pursuing an abortion (often ""not the right time"" in some form or another), there is a silent reason of ""and carrying a pregnancy to term has a cost and a risk that I'm unwilling to undertake under these circumstances.""

So even though E has a higher risk of death, A through D also all have risks of death.  And risks of lesser complications (incontinence, cesarean, infection, cardiomyopathy, hemorrhage, depression), plus the costs of pregnancy (doctor's office visits, lower back pain, limited activities -- no alcohol, etc.).  So to me, although E has a higher *degree* of medical risk, I do not think of A through D as having reasons independent of medical risk.

However, I do see your logic regarding legal justification for killing another human.  I happen not to think that a fetus is another person.

&gt;Curious, would you agree that the biggest issue of contention between people who identify as prolife and prochoice is whether the human fetus/preborn child is a human person with equal value and rights as every other living, human organism?

252,"Thanks. Yes. It helps me understand your line of reasoning better. I do appreciate that you recognized and confirmed that ""women aren't going to stop pursuing abortions"" as a more accurate depiction of what you meant. 

I think there are two key differences between A-D and E though. It seems that the former ""needs"" or ""wants"" (A-D) can be met with by things other than abortion. For example, universal health care, maternity leave, adoption plans, student income support. The latter ""needs"" or ""wants"" also would not be legal justification for killing another human person. Which is why I feel that whether or not the fetus/preborn child is a human person is really at the forefront of this debate.

The latter (E) ""need"" or ""want"" can not be met by any other means except the abortion procedure. In addition, violence to protect oneself from death or serious harm has always been legally justifiable.  

I really feel like coming up with objective criteria would not be as difficult as some assume it would be. I think using other prolife nations (developed nations) and already existing laws as a guide would help quite a bit.

For example, the law does not ban you from smoking around your children but, it does stop you from leaving them to dehydrate.

As far as I know, most of Europe bans abortion after 12 weeks with the exception for the life of the mother (maybe rape and incest as well but I would have to look into that). Ireland and Poland also have very restrictive abortion regulations and actually reap the benefit of lower maternal mortality rates.

Anyway, I do appreciate you answering my question. Sorry about the big wall of text. When I write out what I am thinking I find it helps me digest the whole topic.

---

Let us consider five women, all of whom have chosen to have an abortion.

A) Has no children and is in college.  She has resources such that she could comfortably take a gap year.  She also has a supportive family and would be able to manage child care.  However, it's not the plan she had for her life.  She does not think she *needs* an abortion, but is glad she has the choice.

B) Has three children and thought her family was complete but did not pursue highly effective contraception.  She wants an abortion in order to keep her family at three children.  She does not think that she *needs* an abortion, but at the same time is glad she had the choice.

C) Has three children and is financially unstable.  Having a fourth child, she feels, would jeopardize her ability to take care of her three children.  She characterizes herself as needing an abortion, because she sees taking care of her three existing children as being vital.

D) Has no children and is pursuing an abortion because she does not feel she can complete her education if she carries a pregnancy to term at this time.  Because of her situation in life, she sees completing her education as vital.  She therefore characterizes herself as needing an abortion.

E) Has two children and, in her opinion, now has three.  She is pro-life, believes life begins at conception.  She also has pulmonary hypertension and has been advised she has a 30-50% chance of dying in this pregnancy based on available data.  She reluctantly characterizes herself as needing an abortion, after extensive discussion with her doctors, based primarily on her desire to take care of her two existing children.  She does not characterize herself as wanting an abortion.  She also doesn't characterize herself as needing one.  In her mind, her children need her to have this abortion -- she doesn't need it for herself.  If she had no children, she would take that 30-50% risk.

---

Sure, I could characterize some of these women as ""needing"" an abortion.  E needs an abortion to avoid a high chance of death.  C needs an abortion to take adequate care of her children.  A needs an abortion in order to have the college experience she wanted.  But I could replace ""need"" with ""want"" in each of those sentences and it would remain just as true.

If I had a limited number of abortions to provide, I would ration in some way, but not based on ""need/want"".  Why would I throw in such semantic confusion?  I'd try and come up with some objective criteria for how affected somebody's life would be by lack of access to abortion.  I'm glad I don't need to do this.

I guess it would have been most honest of me to say ""women aren't going to stop pursuing abortions"" instead of ""needing abortions.""

275,"The issue of abortion is only relevant for the duration of the pregnancy.  Once a baby is born, it can be raised by any number of people.  The burden can then be transferred or shared.  The burden of pregnancy cannot be.  

I honestly have difficulty imagining that I would have any sort of liberty whatsoever if I can be forced against my will to maintain a pregnancy and give birth.  And yes, I do consider my bodily autonomy as belonging to me and no one else (I say this as a currently pregnant woman who is choosing to maintain a pregnancy and hopes to give birth in the semi-near future).  

The fact that you take others' interests into account is wonderful.  I do too.  But you haven't actually engaged my central question.  What type of bodily autonomy would you have if you didn't have a choice and it had to happen against your will even if you didn't agree that the interest was compelling? (It's not compelling to you, but *very* compelling to someone else).

In general, when conflicts between moral interest arise, we do not require that people count their personal interests as zero.  We allow them the freedom to make decisions about their bodies up to and including a broad range of self-preservation.  

Your lack of resources question is not similar at all.  When women are in resourced-restrained situations, they submit to food rations, just like anyone.  Food can be shared between whatever people are present, and one person is not required to make all of the sacrifice when there is a food shortage.  I wouldn't think that I had a right to more food than others in such a situation.  Why would I?

But pregnancy is different.  The only resources in pregnancy are those that already belong to the woman because she requires them for herself, and because they already exist in her body (e.g., her arterial blood supply or the calcium in her bones).  A fetus cannot get resources from anyone except her, and she cannot give them without sacrificing herself and incurring risk up to and including death.  If others *require* that she do so, they do so at her expense (and no one else's).

If you are a woman, it is perfectly morally wonderful to say that you believe that any human life inside you is compelling enough that any sacrifice to your own body would be worth it.  In that case, it is your gift to give, and a profound and lovely one at that.  But that is not what you are suggesting.  You are suggesting that some people should be able to force that sacrifice from others.  And yes, *against her will*.  In order to take that choice away from a woman (and give it to her partner or the state), you need to understand that her maintenance of the pregnancy is no longer her gift, but a type of violence against her.

I am in favor of respecting life by respecting pregnancy and the women who choose it.  I believe that children and their fathers should be grateful to the women who bear them for choosing to give them something miraculous and profound that they cannot give themselves.  I am grateful to my mother for this, and I would hope that everyone else would carry similar gratitude.  If we are thoughtful and treat women's right to their own bodies with respect, we might learn what causes them to discontinue pregnancies, and be willing to support them in choosing pregnancy even more frequently (remember that 80% of the time, women do choose birth - aren't they generous?).

Honestly, I think that the most compelling anti-bodily autonomy stance is probably the one that says, ""none of us own our bodies, they are all simply on loan from God.""  You seem to be alluding to that idea here by saying that you would be glad for the opportunity to sacrifice your own body for another. A lovely (and moral) sentiment for an individual to hold about his own body and path to happiness, but less lovely when it is turned outward so that it is not you, but someone else that must do the sacrificing.

And that's where rights come in.  We have no legal precedent for such a moral stance to be enforced against unwilling people.  Not ever.  In that sense, as a society, we do treat bodily autonomy as inviolable.",3,1478741645,2016-11-09 20:34:05
276,"Yes, it is true.

From the article you cite:

&gt; During 1988-1997, the overall death rate for women obtaining legally induced abortions was 0.7 per 100,000 legal induced abortions. [comma mine]

From table two on page 733, they clarify that this rate rises to 8.9 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies once you are 21 weeks or higher.  For comparison, the rates are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 for &lt;8, 9-10, and 11-12 weeks, respectively.

In 2013 the maternal mortality rate in the US was 18.5 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies.

Abortion is hands-down safer than birth.

---

Some clarifications on the above data:

The abortion data are taken from 1988-1997, which is necessary because deaths from abortion are so rare.  This time period was during a rapid increase in the maternal mortality rate in the US.  One could argue that this might distort the data.  However, in 1980 the rate was about 9 per 100,000, which is still *ten times* higher than the 0.7 per 100,000 seen in the 88-97 data you have shared.  Additionally, a lot of the increase in maternal mortality stems from an increase in the primary cesarean rate, which would not affect abortion mortality rates.  Some of the increase stems from an increased average age of child-bearing (think assisted fertility technology).  It would be interesting to tease that out of the available data, although I do not expect it to make a significant difference in the order of magnitude between these risks.

---

I would appreciate either an apology for your misrepresentation of the data, or an explanation of how you reached your strange conclusion.  My present impression is that you did not read the study, or that you hoped that we would not.",5,1478741346,2016-11-09 20:29:06
277,"A few points:

First, what risk of death do you consider acceptable?  I think that the answer to this question varies from person to person, and I prefer to leave it to the person facing the risk of death.

Second, /u/narcsBgone didn't say ""life at risk,"" they said ""life and body at risk.""  There are many health consequences of pregnancy besides risk of death, such as risk of incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, or complications from surgery if they ultimately undergo cesarean birth.  While uncomplicated pregnancies do exist, and the majority of pregnancies are uncomplicated, I do not consider it my place (or yours) to decide for another person what would be an acceptable risk of complications.

Finally, even outside of these *risks*, there are *costs* to pregnancy.  Doctor's visits, lower back pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, time off of work.",4,1478740341,2016-11-09 20:12:21
278,"&gt; An abortion is safer than giving birth.

Is that true? According to the WHO, the maternal mortality rate in western countries is about 7 - 12 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies.

The mortality rate from legal, best medical practices abortion complications is actually significantly higher once you get to about six weeks in the pregnancy.  At thirteen weeks, it's more than twice as likely to cause death, more than three times as likely at 16-20 weeks, and over ten times as likely at 21+ weeks. ([Source](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linda_Bartlett/publication/8648767_Risk_Factors_for_Legal_Induced_Abortion-Related_Mortality_in_the_United_States/links/0deec526ef9807350d000000.pdf))

So according to the data, the average abortion seems to be less safe than the average western birth.

279,"Thank you for your polite reply.  :)

&gt; The father (or anyone) can only prevent a woman from having an abortion by denying her the right to make decisions about her body. 

Assuming we're talking about an unwilling woman, then yes, you're right.  And that's an ugly thing - that we have use coercion at all is something that I don't think anyone should want.  I've been in the situation a few times in my own family where I had to make calls that were against the will of other people for a greater good, and it's really painful.

&gt; No amount of interest in the fetus can erase the fact that it is inside another person.

This is a point of view that you can have - it's one that I don't share.  It seems to presuppose that having your body compelled to do something you don't want it to do is an inviolable right.  But I have a hard time understanding it - we are creatures of the body by nature, almost everything we do is tied to the body.  We quite often compel people to behave this way or that - which necessarily involves them using their body.

&gt; There is no yes, but, here. Either you understand that a woman must have control over her uterus to have bodily autonomy, or you believe that women and their bodies can and should be dictated to by their partners and the government.

I believe that we are social creatures, and when we make moral decisions, it's not good to look only at *I*, but rather the common good.  If my actions will hurt others, I need to look at them very carefully.  It sometimes is the case that pain is caused in the pursuit of a good, and we can justify that loss or pain morally, but I don't think it's fair to just treat the father's interest like a lightswitch where we can just go ""bodily autonomy"" and turn it off.

*Maybe* we have that right, but I don't think it's correct to only consider what we *may* do, but rather what we *ought* to do.  And in this case, whether we *can* just act unilaterally and refuse to bear a child isn't really morally relevant, in my opinion.  I think it's better to consider all the people that would be affected.

&gt; I will assume that you do not have a uterus. So let's talk about your stomach. Let's say that another person had a compelling interest in your stomach and therefore could exert control over everything that you eat, what types of athletics you participate in and would deny you the right to take laxatives, nausea or heartburn medications or even to treat an ulcer if you needed to. If you have cancer, you may need to delay treatment. Moreover, you need to submit to at times weekly colonoscopies to ensure your stomach is ""ok"" no matter the impact it has on your ability to hold a job or provide for your family. Even if you do all this, If you don't get prompt medical care, there is a likelihood that you would die if you are one of the 15% of people to have life threatening complications from your condition.

Okay, let's make this real.  Here's a situation where there is a compelling reason to restrict my use of my stomach: There isn't enough food.

Let's suppose that there wasn't enough food to go around, and everyone around me insisted that I take a smaller portion so that we all can eat.  Would I like it?  No.  I would be hungry.  But I think I *would* have a moral obligation to do it, because otherwise I would be harming others in a quantifiable way.

Similarly for medicine.  If there weren't enough, and it were judged that we need to conserve it, I would be acting anti-socially if I insisted on taking it anyway despite the fact that there was a compelling reason I should not.

&gt; Would you consider yourself to have bodily autonomy in that case? Would you consider that your body was truly yours? Would you want to have to agree that this interest was truly compelling, or would the fact that it's compelling to someone else be enough for you?

I don't think I would have considered myself to have bodily autonomy.  It doesn't bug me, though, because, as you supposed, there was a compelling reason I should make a sacrifice.

Would I think my body was truly mine?  Yes, probably.  And I think it's good when we use what is truly ours in a sacrificial way for the benefit of others.

I also want to point out that not all of the burden of raising a child is contained in bearing it.  The father, if he wants to have it, should be compelled to raise it properly - and that is also a very large burden.",1,1478736779,2016-11-09 19:12:59

If Roe v Wade is overturned, legal abortion will certainly become unavailable in many Republican controlled states and we will likely see a resurgence in complications and  deaths caused by women attempting to self-abort with drugs purchased from questionable online sources. Without access to professional ultrasound services, some women who attempt to self abort will die from undiagnosed ectopic pregnancies.

We will see a rise in the numbers of women forced to give birth to severely deformed or mentally retarded children which will cripple them financially and will also place a financial burden on the state's healthcare and social welfare costs.

If Planned Parenthood is defunded, affordable reproductive and preventative health services will probably become unavailable or unaffordable for women across the country and some women will die as a result of illnesses which would have been treatable if detected early.",37,1478736744,2016-11-09 19:12:24

Let's be clear: we agree that it *shouldn't happen* that people have 5+ abortions.  But that's because we agree it *shouldn't happen* that people have 5+ unplanned pregnancies.  But when they do, the problem isn't that they have reproductive potential.  The problem is that something is getting between them and having enough control over their lives to make things happen the way they want them to.

296,"Hey there, I'm an ob/gyn who does abortions.  I have some thoughts for you.

&gt;I do think a lot of people use abortion as a form of birth control though.

I'm always a little thrown by this statement, because abortion can only be used as a means of birth control.  I know what people mean by it, of course -- they want people to use another means of birth control first.  Every form of birth control has a failure rate, and I also consider *lack of access* to be a form of failure of birth control.

Lack of access can take many forms.  Inadequate funds, inadequate education... for some people, they lack the insight to recognize that birth control is the best choice for them.  ""This time I'll be careful.""  ""No, we'll just be more careful about using condoms.""  As a 17 year old you experienced some barriers to access yourself.

So let's say I have a patient coming in for her fifth abortion.  She doesn't remember to use condoms because a lot of the sex she has is under the influence of meth.  I've offered her resources to quit but it isn't happening yet.  She wants to have children someday and is convinced that next year she is going to get clean and get her life in order.

&gt;then force them to have their tubes tied if they can't be responsible

So you would have me tie her tubes?  Would you wrestle her into the OR for me?  Would you hold her down until we had her medically sedated, to subject her to anesthetic and surgical risk against her consent, to remove her desired reproductive potential against her will?

My reply was in response to this comment. Not sure why you are pointing out the fact that the legal system doesn't recognize a fetus/pre born child as a human person with right?

Obviously the main contention between prolifers and prochoicers is whether or not the fetus/preborn child has value.

&gt;Your entire argument depends upon defining a child as anything beyond and including a fertilized egg, but the rest of the legal system doesn't use that definition. 

Of course. A prolifer's entire argument rests on the premise that a fetus/preborn child is equally valuable and ought to have the same rights as any other human being. And I was showing how they can maintain this to be true and still make an argument to support the rape exception.

&gt;The only time when a fetus would be considered a child is when the mother is planning to carry it to term, which further supports the choice of the mother mattering.

I don't think that this is actually true. Some states have implemented the unborn victims act but I don't think they acknowledge the personhood of the fetus/pre born child.

&gt;A parent would be committing a crime if they forced their baby to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, but a pregnant woman is not committing a crime if they themselves consume those substances, which exposes the, let's say fetus, to those drugs. Shaking a baby is a crime, vigorous exercise while pregnant is not.

I never argued against this. I don't see your point?
 
&gt;This is, of course, because of bodily autonomy and the fact that the fetus is entirely dependent upon the woman. The time when the legal system considers it a child is when it is no longer dependent upon her body.

This is false. Abortion is legal because of privacy laws. But that is a whole other issue and beyond the scope of this discussion. If dependency were the determining factor conjoined twins would have the right to off (kill) each other at will. The reason abortion is legal stems from much more complex things than those you mention.

&gt;You may argue that this should change, but a necessary component of that argument would also be stating that a pregnant woman would be committing a crime by doing any number of common activities while pregnant, even if she was completely unaware of the pregnancy. Bring on the miscarriage trials, right?

I completely disagree with you here. It seems you have missed the whole point of my response.

I showed how a prolifer can agree that a fetus/pre born child is an innocent and equally valuable human being like the rest of us and still support the rape exception. 

Do you realize that there are many first world countries that have implemented prolife legislation successfully? There are no miscarriage hunts. 

In fact, most of Europe has banned abortion after the 12th week.

362,"I will do my best to show you the other point of view (while I don't actually agree with the exception myself).

It has to do with bodily autonomy and legal responsibilities actually.

I don't think that there are many, if any, prolifers who would argue that abortion in cases of rape are morally justifiable.

I think the argument is that parents have a legal relationship with their children and that if they engage in consensual sex they must take on this legal responsibility if their action creates a child.   

I think the argument is that this is an unfair burden to put on a parent who was forced or raped.

Without this legal relationship it is much more difficult to stop abortions that do not involve directly killing the fetus. Basically, terminations that involve inductions could not legally be outlawed.

The reason being is because the law requires parents not only to respect a child's negative right (right not to be killed) but also their positive rights (their right to be feed, hydrated and sheltered).

Negative rights oblige inaction. Positive rights oblige action.

So basically, if you didn't consent then the law can not legally bind you to parent the child. And as such, legislation restricting induced terminations would violate the women's right to bodily autonomy. Because she would not have the legal obligation that parental responsibility presupposes.
 
So while morally it may be wrong to kill the child many prolifers concede that legally we can not enforce a law in this case.

I am a prolife Christian and I think that bible and Jesus are very clear in scripture that we can not kill other human beings to solve our problems and that is what abortion does. It kill another innocent and living human being.

With the exception of a pregnancy that becomes life threatening and the procedure is the only way to save the mom abortion is clearly, from a Christian standpoint, immoral.

Here are the proofs,


Leviticus 24:17

""If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death."" 

Thou Shall Not Murder

“Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.” (Genesis 16:11)

“And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive. But the children struggled in her womb…” (Genesis 25:21-22)

“In the womb he supplanted his brother, and as a man he contended with God.” (Hosea 12:3)

“But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father. For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand) . . .” (Romans 9:10-11)

“Truly children are a gift from the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward” (Psalm 127:3)

“You knit me in my mother’s womb . . . nor was my frame unknown to you when I was made in secret” (Psalm 139:13,15)

“You have been my guide since I was first formed . . . from my mother’s womb you are my God” (Psalm 22:10-11).

“God… from my mother’s womb had set me apart and called me through his grace” (St. Paul to the Galatians 1:15)

“Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17)

“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.” (Jeremiah 1:5)

Clearly the bible states, we can not kill other human beings. And refers to children in the womb as any other child.

What is it that I am missing here? How can a Christian ever support abortion on demand and without apology?",1,1478017891,2016-11-01 12:31:31
378,"&gt;If it was morally wrong to abort, why would it being a rape suddenly change that?

I can do my best to answer this the way I think most prolifers would.

While many prolifers do not agree with abortion in the case of rape there are an exceptionally large amount that do.

There argument is pretty simple. Nonconsensual sex negates parental responsibility laws.

&gt;Being anti-choice, at it's roots, isn't about ""saving babies"", it's about punishing what's seen as the sexual immorality of women. 

And this, shakes head, not really true at all.

379,"There are several reasons you might want to draw conclusions about the morality of an action:

1.  That action is one of several courses of action you yourself might take, and as part of deciding between them, you consider
morality a deciding factor

2.  You are trying to evaluate another person's actions in an actual, specific scenario in order to determine how you want to think about or act toward that person

3.  You want to find out more about how you think about conflicting moral precepts, and this moral question serves as a useful problem case

4.  You want to make generalizations about a person or a group of people to see if their moral reasoning is similar or different from yours

I think the case for abortion as a moral discussion is best for number 1, and gets rapidly worse thereafter. 

I think that one reason is that abortion (like other actions) contains a great many contextual factors (the circumstances leading to pregnancy, the health of the woman and fetus, the age of the woman, the gestational age, the long term cost to the woman or society of each decision) all of which color the decision. 

People are unlikely to know all of these factors about another person's abortion decision (under the most generous of situations). When you add to that a key component of the moral question is the value of a woman's bodily autonomy (and the cost of losing it) it is easier to see why outsiders may come to a different conclusion than the woman herself.  In fact many contextual factors are those faced only by women or only during pregnancy ( which has many many iterations) making it hard to draw widespread conclusions about them. 

I may think that stealing is wrong, but if I apply that to judge someone who is stealing to feed their children, I may misvalue one of the key moral drives.  Now imagine that the context itself is inherently obscure and hard to understand/ relate to. 

Because abortion is a moral choice faced only by women, and because women have traditionally NOT been viewed as having bodily autonomy (they have been treated as the property of their husbands and fathers, up to and including the legality of spousal rape until the 70s), it is vulnerable to the intuition that where to set the value of a woman's bodily autonomy may be based on her femaleness, rather than her right to her body as a person. 

I would suggest that abortion is not the best test case for understanding the moral interplay between life and bodily autonomy. (Assuming that you believe that women own their bodies to a similar degree that men do). That is why I believe that references to organ donation are so much more instructive.  In organ donation, the default donor is male, who we assume to own his body (always) rather than female, who we assume does so only on a provisional basis (except....). 

It is rather simple to create a thought experiment wherein a potential donor may be seen as having as strong or stronger obligation to the recipient as a pregnant woman may to a fetus and I know of no case where the autonomy is not respected over the right to life. I also know of no moral panic over men who choose not to donate organs for various reasons. Only in abortion does this emerge as a great ""quandary.""

I figured that there were two possible reasons why: Either the embryo/fetus has no special value because it isn't human life, or it is human life, however while in the womb the female has absolute control over that life.

I'm kind of seeing different perspectives already though, so that's great. It kind of seems that maybe, yes in the US abortion is different then just getting a tumor or skin tag removed, but it shouldn't be.

For clarity, I'm not stating that abortion *should* be immoral, I'm just wondering whether or not (in the united states) it simply *is* immoral. Morality is of course subjective; What is immoral to one society may not be to another. I don't believe in objective morality.

Basically, it's a wedge issue.

You're asking questions, and that's good, but part of it is going to be having people disagree with parts of your questions that you may not have considered to even be central to the issue.

There may be an invented moral issue, but I think it would be one that grew organically in our society. Like how the embryo/fetus is referred to as a ""child"". If it's just a thing, why would we call it a child?

The sole reason abortion exists is because consent to sex does not mean consent to childbirth. The sole reason birth control exists is because consent to sex does not mean consent to childbirth.

Don't get me wrong here. You are perfectly free to personally choose to believe that every act of sex MUST lead to childbirth and every act of sex obligates a woman to serve as incubator. Those are your personally chosen beliefs though. They are not our law. Nowhere in our law does it state every act of sex MUST end in childbirth.

And at no point in history has every act of sex resulted in childbirth, which proves how unnatural your personally chosen beliefs really are. Even prior to the invention of birth control, every act of sex did not result in childbirth. 

So you are certainly free to fetishize reproduction and pretend that every act of sex MUST result in childbirth, even though nature has never worked that way.

456,"&gt;The root reason for this is that they are not choices being made; it is never a choice to be raped, or to have health issues (unless they were inflicted, which is another conversation). It is, however, a choice to have sex, and run the risk of an unplanned child.

Three counterpoints to this.

From a more epistemological perspective, I find that you're separating some things when there is little distinction.  Specifically,  it is never a *choice* to be raped or have medical issues, but it's also never a *choice* to have an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.  There's no real reasoning given for why we should give any more weight to the idea that someone with an unwanted pregnancy ""should have made better choices"", when in any other situation of people having something put on them without their volition, per your example rape for instance, we know the argument that they ""should have made better choices"" doesn't really apply in other situations where they did not directly make that specific choice, but instead had an unwanted consequence befall them.

From an ethical perspective, there is only one reason we should even consider the right to life of a fetus, and that's if it indeed has such a right to life.  I will again cite your example of pregnancy by rape.  If a fetus is gestating due to a rape, you say that an abortion would be acceptable.  However the fetus, presumably entitled to rights and the respect thereof, didn't rape anyone.  Abridging the freedoms of the fetus in that case is essentially punishing an innocent party for the crimes of a rapist.  But this is moot, because in asserting that the rape exception is valid, you already can see that you have an ethical framework of respecting the right of the parent to their bodily autonomy over any pretense of a right to life of the fetus.  In short, the rape exception and the personhood of the fetus are contradictory.

Finally from a practical level, you're effectively expecting people to not do what has been doing since before there were people to do it.  The entire history of mankind is littered with failed attempts to tell people that they shouldn't have sex when they want.  If there is one affirmative thing that history teaches us, it's that people will fuck, like it or not.  So regardless of whether we want to say that the people having sex are responsible for any gestating fetus that happens as a result, we have to know that such a decision will not have an impact on the number of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.",3,1477780845,2016-10-29 18:40:45

A human embryo/fetus meets the criteria for a living thing. There are 7 basic characteristics of a living thing.

A human embryo/fetus meets the criteria for an organism. That means at fertilization a zygote begins to act very differently than mere cells.

There may be any number of reasons to do this, not the least of which is that the machine is considered much more valuable than the paper, because the machine is a completed, functioning entity (that can make lots of paper!), and the partially-made paper only has value as itself - which is really quite little. Any machine owner would rather stop the machine and dispose of the paper than simply let the paper gum up and break the machine.  It would be irresponsible (and misguided) machine ownership to do otherwise.",12,1477769252,2016-10-29 15:27:32
486,So you allow abortion in the case of rape ? Why is that foetus less deserving of gestation than a foetus conceived by consensual sex?,8,1477768623,2016-10-29 15:17:03
487,"This is a big ol' wall of text; do you want us to stop reading at ""I want to hear other people's opinions on why they are pro-choice."" and give you an answer, or are you wanting someone to give their opinion on each and every one of your points, or did you just want to vent and get all your feelings out?",4,1477768555,2016-10-29 15:15:55
488,"Well, orphanages do close, and the children are removed from the premises without their say.  Fortunately, in those cases, it can happen without the children dying and so the children are sent elsewhere.  Certainly a benefit of being a viable and distinct already-born person that this is possible.",5,1477768356,2016-10-29 15:12:36
489,"I would also like to mention that as an example, if an orphanage holds children, and deems them inconvenient or financially difficult, should they have the right to kill them? Shouldn't they be able to control their orphanage? ",-2,1477767717,2016-10-29 15:01:57
490,"Well, that comes down the question of whether or not you consider a fetus to be part of a woman's body. Saying that seems akin to saying that paper is part of a paper making machine inside of a factory. Paper is a product of the machine, but it is not the machine. And, since this analogy is equating that paper to a fetus, if we tell you that you shouldn't stop the machine in the middle of the process to make the paper, it is not controlling the entire factory, it is only telling this person that they can't stop the machine in the middle of production for the mean of producing paper. This is a faulty analogy, since the value of paper is nothing like the value of a human life, but I think you get the point I'm trying to make. ",0,1477767427,2016-10-29 14:57:07
491,"How does the fact that there is a ""person"" inside it (with no say) make it not her uterus?  How do you make sense of the idea that a woman can control her body, but not her uterus?  Can a woman control her body if she can't control her uterus?",10,1477766717,2016-10-29 14:45:17
492,"Well, it's a person inside of her. A person that doesn't have any say in the matter. It is inside of her uterus, yes, but it is not her uterus. ",-10,1477765237,2016-10-29 14:20:37
493,"&gt;However, this is not their body.

In what way is a woman's uterus not her body?

How can she have control over her body while not having control over her uterus?",15,1477763261,2016-10-29 13:47:41
494,"&gt;but you would have to give up being coy about what you believe


This thread was literally just so I could find out if people who support ""body autonomy"" would support it all the way. There is a reason I'm being ""coy"" otherwise I just get a bunch of radicals calling me a misogynist and twisting my words. 

Do I think women who kill their unborn children should go to prison? Maybe. Do I think its right the government funds the killing of unborn children? No I do not. 

I don't really believe in prison, for anything. It's only useful for protection. Maybe rehabilitation centres for people who kill their unborn. Free with education and contraceptives. I don't know I'm not a policy maker. Jail rarely improves anything especially for the mentally ill.",1,1477762686,2016-10-29 13:38:06
495,"Yawn.  Refer to my previous comment.  There are a couple of mature responses available to my question, but you would have to give up being coy about what you believe:

- ""I don't think jailing would help in that situation, I wouldn't want that to happen, and I would be in favor of structuring laws so that was never an outcome.""

- ""Yes, I think such a terrible, evil person should be punished to the full extent of the law [and somehow don't think the gaping wound in her uterus is enough].  I would be happy to put her in jail myself, and it would give me peace of mind to know that her fetus received justice for its murder.""

I think that the first one is moral, the second is horrible, but at least logically consistent [in that it ignores the impact of pregnancy and abortion on the woman, focusing only on the impact to the fetus].  Perhaps there is a third one you would like to articulate?

Or do you want to just refuse to engage the discussion (while still imagining yourself logical king)?",5,1477761031,2016-10-29 13:10:31
496,"A variety of different things, but generally it's when the fetus is incompatible with life. Something has gone so wrong that it will just not be able to survive. I wrote about one elsewhere in this thread. I read a first-person account of a third trimester abortion the other day where the baby had a severe chromosomal deficiency and would have difficulty breathing and would be in constant searing pain for whatever short time she lived after birth and then died in an agonizing manner. Not sure what the deficiency was, but also not sure it matters. 

The important point is that this does happen, rarely but it does, and the women going through this should not be subjected to additional pain and suffering because some jackhole thinks they should give birth no matter what, without knowing the specifics or caring anything about the baby itself, only that it's ""life"" - not all life is sacred. Biology is not a perfect process and sometimes anomalies happen. That's just a fact of life. ",2,1477760401,2016-10-29 13:00:01
497,"You asked me ""in what way would jailing help?"". 


When did I say we should jail people?",1,1477759210,2016-10-29 12:40:10
498,"You don't have to have actually said something in order for it to be relevant to the conversation.  Particularly when people are actually being jailed in ways related to your ""hypotheticals.""

You don't want to admit that when you take up the side of making something illegal, you need to be willing to discuss what legal consequences are appropriate.  Jailing is a common default punishment for criminal activity.  Are you saying the case would be civil?  A misdemeanor citation?

Are you saying that you believe that women should not be criminally investigated or charged?  If so, then what are you even arguing about?  You seem to be trying to avoid responsibility for your beliefs by not having any.  While simultaneously arguing with people who recognize that opinions advocated have consequences.",7,1477759123,2016-10-29 12:38:43
499,"&gt;In fact, women are jailed in the United States for (mostly drug) offenses against their fetuses. So not quite as ""hypothetical"" as you may want to believe. These criminal charges are the results of prolife efforts and I think that it helps no one and just makes tragedy worse.

What the pro-life movement may have done or what you think they have done is irrelevent to whether the government should change its stance/make it illegal. Also irrelevent to what I think. 


&gt;You don't seem to understand that when you say that something isn't legal, you are indicating that you think that there should be legal consequences. 

Did I say jail? Still wondering where I said that. Do tell me.
