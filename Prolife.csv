2,"In a utopia where abortion is made illegal, who, if any do you think should be punished/held accountable?",10,True,"I was having this discussion with my brother, who is one the fence about abortion (I'm pro life). He asked what I think should be done with people involved with abortions.

Now, to be clear, this is just a hypothetical in most cases, as I don't know of any country that doesn't have a grandfather clause- i.e. anything done while it was legal can't be punished now that it's illegal. Nonetheless I think it's an important question about morality and I'd like to hear what you guys think.

If I was in control, I'd say that women who have recieved abortions by and large should not be held accountable, for the simple reason that mens rea would be extremely difficult to prove in most cases. Women (and men) are fed misinformation about abortion as soon as they are old enough to understand. Opposition to the status quo, whether in the form of protest or simply voicing the other view, is met with either hatred and ostracization. More often, it's met with censorship. See the recent Canadian laws against protesting abortion for proof.

So I don't think women can really be held accountable in nearly any case. They've been essentially brainwashed into believing the faulty idea that a fetus is ""just a clump of cells"".

Now, doctors who have performed abortions? That's a whole nother story.

Doctors have no claim to ignorance. Ob/gyns, and any doctor performing an abortion, have gone through medical school, see the fetus react, and have full access to the knowledge that leads to realizing the humanity of a fetus. In fact, many doctors take joy in performing abortions and are downright disgusting, repulsive and reprehensible in their apathetic worldview towards it: http://mobile.wnd.com/2018/03/abortionist-babies-cant-scream-because-i-cut-cord/

Those who perform abortions are 100% culpable in both actus reus and mens rea. Therefore in my view they are guilty of first degree murder, of children no less, and thus should be given life in prison with no chance of parole. In that utopia where abortions are illegal, I'd like to see thatbe the punishment for anyone who performs an abortion.",1521920188,64,2018-03-24 15:36:28
4,What do you think about this situation?,0,True,"Today I read on the news that a 14 year old from Paraguay died during labor.

5,"Feminism, sexism and abortion",0,True,"Hey Y'all 

The pro choice side is way to quick to label us as sexist or misogynist. However, when thinking through the issue I can see where they are coming from. 

My question is, how can we as a movement make sure that our intentions and results are not negative towards feminism and women's rights? 

Here are some concerns people have brought up to me that I think have merit. 
When discussing legality of abortion, we often talk about how abortion is bad for the mother. However, others have brought up to me that illegalizing something because we think it might be bad for women and therefore women should be barred for their own good is rather sexist. I agree with that. I think when we focus on those things we are implying that women cannot make their own choices. 

Secondly, I had a friend tell me that she believes that pro life beliefs are not inherently sexist, however the way we dismiss the autonomy argument and use words such as ""inconvenient"" to describe crisis pregnancies imply we do not respect a woman's autonomy nor the physical strain pregnancy can put on a person. I have to agree with that one too. I think using a word such as ""inconvenient"" to describe pregnancy greatly down plays the physical changes that happen during pregnancy and the social/career affects the pregnancy might have, as well as the mental anguish it may cause. 

She also mentioned having to be careful when discussing this issue because women's rights to autonomy have been disrespect and discarded in the past. Again, I think she is right. 

So how can we make sure that we are not being sexist? 
At the core of this for many of us is the baby, so I know that it can be hard to fathom that are arguments have anything bad about them. I just wanted to start a discussion on this.

6,"There is no difference between abortion and a miscarriage in terms of ""end results"".",12,True,"The biggest argument I hear is ""a fetus isn't human"" and I'm assuming others have heard it as well.

The end results of [abortion and a miscarriage are the same]: The baby is dead.

The ONLY difference: Is whether the expectant mother wants the pregnancy or not. 

---------------

Next time a pro-choice person complains: 

You say: If I shouldn't be upset about abortions then I wont't be upset about a woman's miscarriage either.

The other person will naturally respond: That's a horrible thing to say!

And you say: No it's not. A fetus isn't a person right? It's just a clump of cells.

Then they'll respond with: But that's different...

You ask: How's it different?

They say: Because what makes a miscarriage a ""miscarriage"" is that the woman wanted--

60,The normalisation of abortion in young teens is really disturbing,81,True,"I grew up in the UK, so bear in mind that the cultural attitudes towards abortion differ slightly from the US. For example, I've never heard of a single British pro-life group.

Anyway

I grew up there and I had friends and classmates at age 13-14 who had gotten abortions. During sex ed they explained different contraceptive methods and included abortion as a preferable option to having a child unprepared. Nobody ever questioned the morality, nobody ever even THOUGHT to question the morality and if I had asked I'm sure my teachers would claim it wasn't a real human.

In fact most pro-choice people that I know, who live in countries with easily accessible abortions, have never bothered to think about the morality. 

They simply accept it as normal. *I* at age 14 accepted it as normal. 

At age 17 I decided that I personally wouldn't do it but that other women should have the right. 

It took me two more years to realise the error of that thought process, and in that time I moved to a country where elective abortions are completely illegal. At the time I was outraged to be losing that ""choice."" It took a law to force me to fully reexamine my views.

I find it really disturbing how indoctrinated our children are into thinking abortion is normal, to the point where most of them don't even think to question it. 

Schools today offer both sides of evolution, I remember having religious education on all sorts of different religions as well as science classes. 

So why was the pro-life argument never mentioned? ",1521367627,54,2018-03-18 06:07:07

63,Women's pregnancy Center in need of help,30,True,"Hello everybody.
I volunteer at a center that deals with women going through unplanned pregnancies and we are in need of help!

If you have it in your heart to help us, please read on. (or jump to the tldr; section)

In short, the center I volunteer at is called ""Lydia – A Beating Heart""  and is the first and only pregnancy resource center in the entire country (Macedonia). We offer counseling and help while promoting the value of life and the baby’s right to be born. We never force a decision, but explain all the risks, benefits and long term effects of their decisions.

We don't exclude families that have already gone through abortion. We offer counseling to them too, because the bad effects of abortion can come later in life.

Another fact about our center is that we are truly pro-life, not just pro-birth. Meaning, if the families that decided to keep their unborn babies wish so, we continue to have contact with them and try and support them in many ways. For example, we donate diapers, baby food, baby cosmetics and so on.

As you know these kind of centers receive less and less support because the pro-choice movement is becoming stronger. We have come to a point where operating the center is almost impossible and soon we will be forced to close one of the two offices we have.

In order to keep operation we need your help. 
Our partner center, which is in the US has set up a donations page:  [https://connect.egiving.com/macedonia-centers-mission-pro/blue-ridge-womens-center-inc](https://connect.egiving.com/macedonia-centers-mission-pro/blue-ridge-womens-center-inc)

---

I found out when I found my father's journal in the attic. I did not know he used to keep a journal. He is stern and not very talkative. So when I dusted the cover and opened it to the first page, I was surprised by his thoughts and feelings written in his characteristically elegant handwriting.

Below are brief summaries of his entries because I don't think I can put an entire journal in a Reddit post.

First page

&gt;""a general ramble on human existence""

Some pages later...

&gt;I don't know if I should move to [biggest city in the country]. Will I find employment? Do I have the credentials?

Some pages later...

&gt;I met [Mom's name]. She is energetic and playful. She is like sunshine to my gloomy days. I think less of my worries when she's around.

&gt;[Mom's name] is enthusiastic about my plan to get out of this town. She says she can support us with her teacher's salary until I find employment. What did I do to deserve her?

Many pages later...

&gt;[My name] is born. I went to the hospital at 3:00 AM. The fatigue melted when I got to see him. I will make the world the best place for him. I will give him what I didn't have. I can do it if I put my mind to it. 

&gt;Boss told me to take a day off. Strange.

&gt;Boss treated me to a dinner. Everyone is nice to me. Everyone congratulates. I'm embarrassed and happy at the same time.

Some pages later... (He doesn't have many entries. I suspect the work kept him busy. One entry to account for several months. You get it.)

&gt;[My name] is very talkative like [Mom's name]. I guess I'll be a loner in this family.

&gt;[My name] likes books and is talented at playing the piano. Should I nurture this talent of him? Will a musician's life be bearable for him?

Some pages later

&gt;Unexpected guest. [Mom's name] found out on Thursday but decided to tell me today. We spent the whole day talking. I am not sure. We are not affluent. Our parents can't help us. Are we capable of having another human in this family? I do not know. But I need to decide quickly. All is muddled. I sense the wretched uncertainty creeping up. I feel like my 22-year-old self again. This is bad. 

&gt;[Mom's name] said she wants to keep it. I can't say no. She says we will greet destiny as it comes to us. I am not sure. But she's the one who's carrying it, so her opinion counts more. 

&gt;We decided to keep it. If it's a boy, we'll name it [Brother's name], if it's a girl, we'll name it [Hypothetical sister's name].

Fast forward many years,

**[Brother's name]** grew up as a quiet but athletic boy who loves football. Then in high school, his grades shot up, nobody knows why. He graduated valedictorian and is studying astrophysics in the best university in the country.

**[My name]** grew up as a talkative boy who loved books and art. Then he got depressed and become non-talkative. Then he got depressed further and lost his love for books and art. He climbed through his misery for years. Things are looking up these days. He feels happy and is rebuilding his life.

Like I promised, I don't have an argument (to shove down your throat, like many do on the Internet). I just wanted to share a story. I am non-political and non-religious, but maybe my brother is the reason why I am against abortion. 

I keep this value in me because this is a contentious topic. But if I am faced with the same choice as my dad, I will do as he did. I have no right to other people's lives and their decisions. But I have all the rights to mine.

My brother's existence made me believe: Everyone deserves life.

I also believe: Possibilities shouldn't be extinguished.

But I will not force my belief to anyone.

I wish peace and harmony to everyone reading this. 

You are precious. You have life. Cherish it and do it justice.

Peace,

It seems like for them, an abortion is a method of birth control, nothing else.

They show no respect for the woman or her body.

They aren't really pro-choice. They're just pro-abortion.

If they force, bully, or manipulate a woman into having an abortion, that's not pro-choice at all.

&gt;She said she wanted to keep it. I was furious. I gave a speech. I made my opinion very clear that i did not want this child at all. She said it would fuck her up psychologically if she went through with it. I didn't understand because I'm not the one doing it.

Manipulation

&gt;I could fire up that superpower we're all suppose to have and manipulate yourself out of this position. I think you've already screwed yourself though. I've had a couple unwanted pregnancies and what I did was remain calm, let the woman know it was her choice...keeps communication flowing. Then I could slip in things about how much here life would change for the worse. I didn't let the issue stew for days and I kept it private. Bringing in more people just adds shit. I offered to pay all expenses to abort, take her, and because I knew it would be difficult I offered a vacation...now we're talking about vacations, where does she want to go, do...now she's happy as shit and not thinking about the baby.

Have any of you used facebook to talk to friends about abortion? Do you think it's a good idea? How does facebook work? If I make a post is it possible they won't even see it because of a busy news feed?

I will put a draft of the facebook post in the comments of this post. Any advice/improvements would be great. All criticism welcome! Is my post too long?

149,My abortion argument (intended for civil discussion) [discussion],0,True,"It’s such a complicated issue, and hard to defend for the side of pro choice. For pro-lifers, there argument is easier, as they can say that abortion is wrong under any circumstance, as a human is being killed. For pro choicers, they have to explain why it is right, at various stages (I.e 9 months, if someone repeatedly gets abortions as a form of birth control etc.). However m, just because it’s hard to explain, does not imply that pro lifers are right. It’s hard, because it’s a very personal opinion. On one hand, you have people who believe a fetus is a human being, on the other, you have people who think it is cells. For me, I can honesty say I don’t know what makes a human a human, and at what stage, but I can say that I am most definitely pro choice (as I don’t view a fetus as a human being). To me, I can acknowledge the fact that all fetuses are capable of becoming a human, however at the stage of becoming a fetus, i don’t consider them equal to us, as they can not develop complex emotions, thoughts, desires, etc. Instead they are akin to an animal, who needs neccacery things to survive (food water etc.). So when someone gets an abortion, it is like killing an animal. I’m not saying that it’s not sad, (just like killing a cow, for meat is still sad), but at the end of the day, the pros outweigh the cons. Morally, it may be best to avoid an abortion, through birth control, adoption etc. However, at the end of the day, it is more important to protect a mothers right to choose what is best for her, as that would strip her of her own rights. Sure it would be sad to most, just like it is sad to Kill animals for food, but at the end of the day, the pros outweigh the cons.

173,"""Women have less rights than a corpse"" - what about a pregnant corpse?",14,True,"It is very common the use of arguments like ""women have less rights than &lt;insert anything here&gt;"". The most famous is ""[women VS guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOTap56D9PU)"". 

Among pro-violent-choice circles, there is a common argument that it is legally prohibited to forcibly take organs even from corpses, but ""those wretched pro-birthers want to force the women to host a parasite inside them"" (full colors).

About that ""corpses have more rights than women"" thing, I was thinking about it a couple of weeks ago in an unusual scenario. 

An 8-month pregnant mother was shot in the head. (It occurred a long time ago, maybe 5 years, I'm not sure.) As a consequence, she died. 

But she was maintained in life support for a while, until the appopriate time for a C-section. (EDIT: if relevant, it was an expected baby for all the family.)

I think it is a clear case of a ""dead body being used as an incubator"", and no one would say it is ""intrinsically evil"".

Like I said I've lived among liberals my whole life, and they'd say things like ""Germans that didn't fight the nazis were just as bad as nazis"", and just generally that violence to resist oppression and genocide is good.

The idea behind being pro-life to my understanding is that a fetus is a person and because of that, it's wrong to kill a fetus or to put it in harm's way.

So if a woman had a condition that made her very prone to miscarriages (genetic or due to constant drug use), should she not be allowed to conceive? My thinking is that taking away a person's right to bear children seems intuitively un-Christian. But also allowing a woman to knowingly unintentionally kill fetuses in the womb seems at least like 3rd degree murder if a fetus is treated as a person.

206,"On the American gun control debate: Two major arguments used by the ""pro-Gun,"" camps are strikingly similar to two major arguments of the pro-abortion camps.",0,True,"Hi all. I am going to present my views on current arguments in favor of the legality and morality of guns--specifically automatic, semi-automatic, or self-loading rifles-- and the parallels I see to arguments used in favor of the legality and morality of abortion. I wrote this VERY technically and devoid of real emotional influence. Of course, emotions are part of what makes humans human. There are emotional arguments and appeals to be made over the gun control debate, but this is a logical and ethical appeal. Also, many people in the conservative, Republican, or alt-right groups reject and mock emotional appeals immediately, and I believe it's most productive and good to avoid immediate rejection and mockery. 

Here we go: 


There are a few often-cited reasons for the legality and use of guns in the US: hunting, protection/ safety, fun, and so that guns could be used to prevent unjust government takeovers. Modern automatic, semi-automatic, or self-loading firearms, like AR-15s, are usually defended by the following three arguments: 


1. ""Americans have the right to use these weapons and we need these weapons in order to  **prevent tyrannical government takeover.**""

2. ""Americans have the right to use these weapons and we need these weapons in order to **maintain personal and family safety in the event of an attack or threat, and living in this safety is a comfort to us.**""


3. ""Americans have the right to own these weapons and we need these weapons because **shooting these weapons is fun and taking care of these weapons is a hobby/ tradition.**"" 


If a person uses the arguments 2 and 3-- personal safety/ comfort against perceived threats and personal enjoyment/ hobbyism, respectively-- to excuse and justify the continued legality of semi-automatic/ self-loading weapons, despite mass carnage and loss of innocent life, I see unfortunate parallels to arguments used by pro-abortion advocates. 


An argument often used to defend the legality and morality of abortion is ""Gestating, birthing, and raising a child does not agree with my personal senses of comfort and safety. My right to comfort and safety is more important than a fetus' supposed right to life."" This argument is more often phrased something like, ""Having a baby isn't in my life plan right now, and I am the one who gets to decide how I live my life. It's my life and my choice how to live it."" 


Another argument used to defend the legality and morality of abortion is, ""Having sex is not an act of consent to creating and having a child, and sex should not be hampered or punished. My right to enjoy myself sexually is more important than a fetus' supposed right to life."" This argument is more often phrased something like, ""Sex is a human right, and women should not be punished for having sex!"" 


Arguments 2 and 3 for gun ownership (""my safety!"" and ""my fun!"") and my two example arguments for abortion (""my comfort!"" and ""my fun!"") present the same moral idea: one person's right to comfort/safety and pleasure/fun is more important than other people's right to life, and thus, the rights to comfort/safety or pleasure/fun should be defended legally. 


Supporting this moral viewpoint on one issue and opposing this moral viewpoint on another issue is hypocritical. Because many conservative/ Republican/ alt-right support pro-gun legality/ morality and anti-abortion legality/ morality, and because these are issues of immense discussion perceived importance, these conservative groups are hypocritical and thus amoral. 


I cannot stand, in good conscience, with groups that support one person's right to comfort/ enjoyment over others' rights to life. I believe that no other people can, in good conscience, stand with those groups, and I believe that **we, the people of the pro-life movement, must fight against the continued legal protections of semi-automatic/auto-loading weapons.**  


I welcome other comments, additions, or rebuttals. I am trying to keep this discussion as civil as possible, and I hope that anyone making a rebuttal will do the same.",1519364095,7,2018-02-23 00:34:55

The year is 2023, humans have finally landed on Mars. A few days after the initial landing the people who went to Mars say that they found a single cell organism on the surface of the red planet. Everyone back home goes nuts because life was discovered on Mars. Now let’s head back to 2018 where a woman made the decision to have sex with a man. The woman becomes pregnant but decides that she doesn’t want to have a baby, so she decides to have an abortion. She will most likely be told that the baby won’t feel anything because it isn’t “alive” yet, but if a single celled organism found on Mars is called life, why isn’t a child that has multiple cells, can feel pain, and has developed limbs?

280,Question: The Line of bodily autonomy,5,True,"My medical school class is given ethics education, and currently I'm rotating in OBGYN. Our discussion involved a woman whose term child needed a C-section because the baby would not survive vaginal birth but the mother refused. A classmate (who is fairly pro-choice) made a good observation: what is the essential difference between an elective abortion and this case where the mother's choice in both instances leads to her child's death? This got me thinking, why do we have laws that allow women to sentence their children to death simply because they do not want the procedure? And should laws be changed to prioritize the right to life of the child in cases like these above the bodily autonomy of the mother? 

I'm a staunch believer in individual rights, but also very pro-life (related causes to me), so this has been both an interesting and unsettling thought experiment. Because even deeply pro-choice people recognize that this term child who can survive without a doubt outside the womb needs to be delivered, but the mother is essentially choosing death for her child.

However, one question from the left that I've found difficult to answer is ""Should women be prosecuted for murder?"" Most conservatives, Shapiro included, see the mother as a victim of the mainstream abortion ideology and lacking of the mens rea (intent) to be charged for murder (the abortionists would be charged, instead). I find this to be one area where conservatives are not being intellectually honest. Even if you were to accept that premise, it would still be just under the law to try women for involuntary manslaughter or some other legal standard. There are several glaring holes in this logic. This article I think sums in up well.

My gut instinct does tell me that abortion is wrong however, logically speaking I do not see what exactly is immoral about killing non-sentient life forms. I'll admit that there issues of irresponsibility and miseducation, but I don't think there's anything wrong, per se, with killing no sentient life.

As I understand it, sentience doesn't begin until sometime toward the end of the fetal stage, so up until that time, the embryo/fetus has no preferences, desires, interests, or wants that would be curtailed by abortion. If being human means anything, it at minimum means being able to experience the world subjectively. It means being able to perceive better and worse situations - being able to suffer psychologically or physically.

So essentially, my question is, why do you believe that non-sentient fetuses have inherent moral value or that we have any direct duties to non-sentient life that would demand that we, let alone the state, violate the rights of actual rights-holders (i.e., women)?",1517272544,67,2018-01-29 19:35:44

354,Just thought I'd share this.,7,True,"I was watching an interview that someone had posted on here earlier.

I noticed that the prolife defender got caught easily on two questions that were designed to sidetrack the debate.

First, why aren't we taking care of born and living breathing babies instead of caring for the preborn?

Second, contraception. Would you be ok with the morning after pill taken by a rape victim?

Here's my advice for the first accusation, never allow them to make a distinction between a preborn and born child. Respond by saying, if I was a paediatric heart surgeon would you criticise me for saving 
a 1 year old child's life but not caring for every other older child or that child throughout their whole life? How is this scenario any different?
 
Here is what I would say to the second, would you be o.k. with banning all elective abortions? Or, I may be personally against contraception but I am not in the business of banning it. Or, some prolifers use the argument that since plan B's primary mechanism of function is to stop ovulation (and not actually kill the embryo) than it would be ok. Other's say that this would be considered a case of defending oneself against the sperm the perpetrator left in their body. 

But again, sometimes the best thing is to concede that if they agree to ban all elective abortion you would be ok with the exceptions (for now anyway).

I'm politically and socially moderate and mixed. I believe people have a right to choices on 'their' bodies but I don't think that unborn babies are 'parasites' and not their own 'essence' of life. I just feel that anyone that is pro choice with absolutely no stipulations need to desperately re'evaluate their positions and thought process. They are 'alive' and get a chance at life.. they are here to experience life, love, joy, sadness, anger, and growth.. just existence itself which is a blessing so it's wrong to deny the same blessing from an unborn child.

481,Should we stop encouraging adoption? Am I going crazy?,5,True,"I will preface this post with the acknowledgement that I am Catholic, so that does influence the ""why"" behind my pro-life stance, although ultimately it was science that dissuaded me from the pro-choice stance as I was Catholic and pro-choice for many years.

Today, my friend who gave her daughter up for adoption 11 years ago posted a video on facebook through her Catholic ministry's page where she emotionally addressed her daughter and told her how much it tore her apart to carry her, birth her, then give her away to another family, but that ultimately she's so happy she made the decision because now the girl has a happy life and a mother and father who love her. I thought it was very touching.

And then I glanced through the comment section after seeing an ""angry react"" and boy, I was not prepared for the shit show that went down there. Seemingly out of the woodwork, a ton of people who said they were adoptees told her to take the video down because it was triggering. Much debate ensued and their positions became much more clear, and it was heartbreaking to read as an outsider and someone who has little personal experience with adoption outside of a friend who said she was adopted.

Basically all of these adoptees, one of whom ran a ministry for ""adoptees in recovery,"" held the position that adoption is NEVER a good option. Some of them held different beliefs about abortion (many said they would have rather been aborted than adopted, others were against abortion and were Christian), but all of them resented the fact that their birth moms gave them up for adoption. The Christian adoptees' reasoning was that God doesn't make mistakes and if he didn't want a woman to raise a child as her own, He would not have put the child in her womb, but in someone elses' womb. Another thing in common that all these adoptees had was the strong belief that churches and the pro-life movement should stop pushing adoption on women facing crisis pregnancies and making adoption seem like a good option when raising the kid or having a close family member raise the kid is what should be suggested.

I was very skeptical when I first read through their comments,but it really did make me think about how awful the adoption process can be and how much money it costs and I'm starting to question a lot of long-held, unquestioned beliefs about adoption, adoptive parents, adoptees and birth moms. Should the Church and the pro-life movement step back and reassess its rhetoric here? ""Adoption not abortion"" is such a commonly used phrase to dissuade abortion-minded women, but what if the adoptees in this thread have a point that it's not actually the most loving thing to suggest to a woman facing a difficult situation nor for the child? Thoughts?

Also for those interested in seeing the thread for yourself, it's on this public facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/EzerProject/videos/vb.1551528441825923/1873344142977683/?type=2&amp;theater&amp;comment_id=1875138826131548&amp;reply_comment_id=1875347139444050&amp;notif_t=video_reply&amp;notif_id=1516212106973719

This involves altering culture, advancing a new system moving away from national sovereignty and promoting degeneracy for the purpose of control and destruction of life that was not deemed fit to survive. The process of natural selection which creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform was to be altered to get rid of the undesirables and deplorables. The eugenics movement had become more technical and sophisticated at this stage, and even more so now.

Some of the subjects covered is hyper sexualizing the youth changing women’s clothing while getting kids interested in sex at earlier ages to target them for early pregnancies which would change the perception of traditional parents attitudes towards abortion. 

REDIRECTING THE PURPOSE OF SEX - SEX WITHOUT
REPRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION WITHOUT SEX
    Well, from population control, the natural next step then was sex. He said sex must be separated from reproduction. Sex is too pleasurable, and the urges are too strong, to expect people to give it up. Chemicals in food and in the water supply to reduce the sex drive are not practical. The strategy then would be not to diminish sex activity, but to increase sex activity, but in such a way that people won't be having babies.

CONTRACEPTION UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE TO ALL
    And the first consideration then here was contraception. Contraception would be very strongly encouraged, and it would be connected so closely in people's minds with sex, that they would automatically think contraception when they were thinking or preparing for sex. And contraception would be made universally available. Nobody wanting contraception would be .. find that they were unavailable. Contraceptives would be displayed much more prominently in drug stores, right up with the cigarettes and chewing gum. Out in the open rather than hidden under the counter where people would have to ask for them and maybe be embarrassed. This kind of openness was a way of suggesting that contraceptions .. that contraceptives are just as much a part of life as any other items sold in the store. And, contraceptives would be advertised. And contraceptives would be dispensed in the schools in association with sex education!

SEX EDUCATION AS A TOOL OF WORLD GOVERNMENT
    The sex education was to get kids interested early, making the connection between sex and the need for contraception early in their lives, even before they became very active. At this point I was recalling some of my teachers, particularly in high school and found it totally unbelievable to think of them agreeing, much less participating in, distributing of contraceptives to students. But, that only reflected my lack of understanding of how these people operate. That was before the school-based clinic programs got started. Many, many cities in the United States by this time have already set up school-based clinics which are primarily contraception, birth control, population control clinics. The idea then is that the connection between sex and contraception introduced and reinforced in school would carry over into marriage. Indeed, if young people when they matured decided to get married, marriage itself would be diminished in importance. He indicated some recognition that most people probably would want to be married. .. but that this certainly would not be any longer considered to be necessary for sexual activity.

TAX FUNDED ABORTION AS POPULATION CONTROL
    No surprise then, that the next item was abortion. And this, now back in 1969, four years before Roe vs. Wade. He said, ""Abortion will no longer be a crime."" Abortion will be accepted as normal, and would be paid for by taxes for people who could not pay for their own abortions. Contraceptives would be made available by tax money so that nobody would have to do without contraceptives. If school sex programs would lead to more pregnancies in children, that was really seen as no problem. Parents who think they are opposed to abortion on moral or religious grounds will change their minds when it is their own child who is pregnant. So this will help overcome opposition to abortion. Before long, only a few die-hards will still refuse to see abortion as acceptable, and they won't matter anymore.

ENCOURAGING HOMOSEXUALITY ... ANYTHING GOES
HOMOSEXUALITY ALSO WAS TO BE ENCOURAGED.
    ""People will be given permission to be homosexual,"" that's the way it was stated. They won't have to hide it. And elderly people will be encouraged to continue to have active sex lives into the very old ages, just as long as they can. Everyone will be given permission to have sex, to enjoy however they want. Anything goes. This is the way it was put. And, I remember thinking, ""how arrogant for this individual, or whoever he represents, to feel that they can give or withhold permission for people to do things!"" But that was the terminology that was used. In this regard, clothing was mentioned. Clothing styles would be made more stimulating and provocative. Recall back in 1969 was the time of the mini skirt, when those mini-skirts were very, very high and very revealing. He said, ""It is not just the amount of skin that is expressed ... exposed that makes clothing sexually seductive, but other, more subtle things are often suggestive."".. things like movement, and the cut of clothing, and the kind of fabric, the positioning of accessories on the clothing. ""If a woman has an attractive body, why should she not show it?"" was one of the statements. There was not detail on what was meant by ""provocative clothing,"" but since that time if you watched the change in clothing styles, blue jeans are cut in a way that they're more tight-fitting in the crotch. They form wrinkles. Wrinkles are essentially arrows. Lines which direct one's vision to certain anatomic areas. And, this was around the time of the ""burn your bra"" activity. He indicated that a lot of women should not go without a bra. They need a bra to be attractive, so instead of banning bras and burning them, bras would come back. But they would be thinner and softer allowing more natural movement. It was not specifically stated, but certainly a very thin bra is much more revealing of the nipple and what else is underneath, than the heavier bras that were in style up to that time.

137,Are they “human beings” ?,0,True,"Obviously a human fetus/embryo is a human, but are they also human beings?

Some might point out that that “being”  means existence, but the secondary definition for “being” is:
&gt; the nature or essence of a person.

So, being a “human being” is more of a philosophical issue (like personhood) while simply being a “human” is scientific.

Also, the term “being” (and “human being”) are usually references to existing in the open, ie outside of the mother in the case of humans.

And here’s the definition of human being:
&gt; a separate individual man, woman, or child of the species Homo sapiens, distinguished from other animals by superior mental development, power of articulate speech, and upright stance.

So, I don’t see how a human fetus is a human being because:

1. Not **separate.**

This is a genuine question, I swear I am not trying to be a troll. 

In your opinion, is there a level of psychological or physical trauma where abortion should be allowed? 

For instance, if the mother will have severe PTSD for the rest of her life because of a pregnancy, or if carrying the pregnancy to term would give her chronic pain, infertility, paralysis etc. Obviously, there is a whole spectrum of these things. 

Also, I know the spectrum of trauma can go all the way to death, so if you just say not unless the mother is going to die, that counts too.

That’s not my responsibility. They have no right to force me to use my body in ways I don’t want to benefit them. If they die, sorry, but I own my body and I am under no obligation to use it to help them. 

See the similarities? For the record, I’m not actually against vaccines, I myself am fully vaccinated and plan to continue to receive them. However, this sounds awfully close to pro choice arguments.

182,Complications with legal personhood,0,True,"If Roe v. Wade was overturned and fetuses were granted legal personhood, it would generate countless legal and social dilemmas:

1) Would they become dependents for tax and estate purposes, be counted in official census-taking, and be subject to many other laws affecting persons?

2) Wouldn't every zygote/embryo/fetus require a Social Security Number, and possibly even some sort of Certificate of Conception?

3) Would having none other than you and an embryo present in your car (either through pregnancy or hypothetically in an IVF vial) qualify you to drive in the carpool lane on the freeway?

4) Would you be required to purchase an extra ticket for events that don’t allow free entry for even young children? Not doing so would mean that the unborn person is involuntarily “trespassing,” which would likely warrant repercussions for the individuals that illegally brought them in, like a legal fine for example. 

The absurdity of these proposals reveals that society might not think of fetuses as persons and would have great difficulty trying to treat them as such. Some might argue that special laws or legal exceptions could be written for fetuses to accommodate their unique characteristics, but the very fact that exceptional laws for fetuses would have to be created proves that they are incapable of having the same legal status as current persons.

5) The biggest challenge in giving legal rights to embryos arises when trying to decide whose rights would take precedence when they conflict — the woman's or her zygote's?

6) When a fetus is miscarried or stillborn, wouldn’t the police technically have to investigate the mother? After all, they’d need to find out if she’s guilty of manslaughter, for example let’s say that she consumed certain food/medicine that causes miscarriages. Regardless of whether or not the death appears to be natural with no foul play, wouldn’t there at least be some sort of extremely shallow investigation/questioning like how we see when deaths are documented? 

7) Although uncommon, what if the parents’ chromosomal abnormalities causes an extremely high miscarriage rate in their offspring?

I recall very clearly Hillary Clinton making this exact argument during the debates, she said very emphatically that she believes in a Women's RIGHT TO CHOOSE! It seems to me that her party doesn't feel that way about anything else. 

If she has a business shouldn't she have the FREEDOM and CHOICE to deny service to whomever she wants? 

What about her CHOICE to go to whatever college she wants? What about her freedom not to have her place taken by someone else who scored lower, but got in through affirmative action policies? 

What about her FREEDOM not to have her money stolen from her and used to purchase cell phones for other people? 

Women should be free to choose. They should have more choices than what the supposed ""pro-women's choice"" party wants them to have. They should be completely free to have sex and accepting the responsibility that comes with it. They are free to take a risk knowing they could become pregnant.

197,"The Fallacy of the ""Removing Life Support Gives Reason to Allow Abortion"" Argument Explained",2,True,"There is a common argument, with several variations, that equates removal of life support to sanction abortion. 

The allowance to remove life support without responsibility for murder is not the same as aborting someone. 

Think about how those two beings (the person on life support and the aborted baby) got into the situation in the first place.

In the case of life support, how did they end up on life support? Was is a disease, medical condition, accident, or due to someone being violent against them? 

If they are on life support because someone purposefully intending to harm them, let's say attacking them with intent to harm, then the person who attacked them is responsible for their death. The person who disconnects tubes isn't responsible for the life supported persons condition.

If the person on life support is on life support because they have a medical condition on their own, or have a disease, or were involved in a true accident, then no one is responsible for their death, even in the case of disconnecting tubes.

If a baby dies due to someone forcefully disconnecting it from uterus (or using any other abortion method), then those who were involved with disconnecting it from uterus are responsible. 

If a baby dies due to miscarriage, no one is responsible for the death.

200,"On rape exception: Solving unplanned pregnancy, not just unplanned parenting",11,True,"I'm on the pro-life/pro-choice fence after some personal experiences and looking to learn more about how the movement feels about rape exceptions. 
When I became pregnant after my rape, I didn't think about adoption because it wouldn't solve my problem; it wasn't that my problem was unplanned parenting (in which case I'd choose adoption). My problem was unplanned *pregnancy*, because it was too mentally traumatizing to see and feel my body change in ways I never consented to. The pregnancy was so traumatizing that I saw no other way than to kill myself if I was forced to continue this pregnancy, and I was able to obtain an abortion. 
I guess my question is: if you're pro-life, how do you respond to the idea that : regardless of what options exist for stopping an unplanned parenthood (adoption), what if someone needs to stop an unplanned *pregnancy* itself, and without one, it ends up in their suicide because of how traumatizing the forced pregnancy is?


EDIT: if I may I'll add another question that keeps popping up for me. I'm confused about the legal logistics of rape exceptions; would it have to go to trial, etc in order to get some kind of rape abortion waiver?

231,Could the pro-life message be reinforced through tangential media?,7,True,"A lot of great (and [not so great](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/7i7lhc/well_this_isinteresting_a_zootopia_webcomic/)) stories have explicitly pro-life messages, but that can be very tricky to do well. The message is likely to end up being watered down, since delving into the philosophical minutiae can easily make a story deem dry and unapproachable at best, and preachy at worst, and attempts at allegory will inevitably contain differences that opponents could seize on.

However, maybe it's possible to spread the pro-life message through less heavy-handed means. One of the major strengths of the pro-choice side is the pervasive myth that birth represents (at best) a major discontinuity in a person's life, or (at worst) the absolute beginning. From a pro-life perspective, birth is a significant milestone, but is still ultimately just a change in location that has no bearing on a person's nature or value.

Consider, for example, [the opening scene of Pixar's _Inside Out_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x__NgnMBHV0). It's a beautiful scene, and it serves its purpose in the narrative, but there's also an underlying message that it conveys, whether it intends to or not. When the screen lights up and Joy materializes into existence as Riley is held by her parents, the movie is clearly saying that this is the beginning of Riley's story. Riley began to exist at birth; whatever her mother was carrying inside her for nine months, that wasn't Riley.

That's not just a minor quibble, either; it has serious effects. When this kind of message is consistently reinforced through popular culture, it inevitably results in an ""othering"" of the unborn. There's you, and then there's the fetus that would become you. This is why the ""What if you had been aborted?"" question is typically so ineffective; this othering results in them filing the question alongside ""What if your parents had never met?"" instead of ""What if you'd been smothered as an infant?"" or another appropriate question.

Obviously, starting the movie with a scene of Riley in the womb might be unnecessarily confusing, but the same opening scene could be done through a pro-life lens. Imagine the same opening shot, except when the camera zooms into Riley's mind, the headquarters is already there, maybe dimly lit to keep the reveal. Joy is excited to finally see Riley's mother, after only hearing her voice for so long, and the rest of the introductions go as before. The same narrative purpose is fulfilled, without implying that unborn-Riley simply never existed.

Sorry if this got a little ramble-y, but this is a thought that's been bouncing around in my head for a while, and I felt like I might as well put it out there and see if anyone else has had similar thoughts.",1512809626,7,2017-12-09 03:53:46

Wouldn't that be relevant too? But I digress.) 

I have respect for Kirsten Powers because of her work on Gosnell and calling out the media for ignoring it but I think she's mistaken here. But I've seen versions of her claim in various articles and graphs that have gone around social media and Reddit. 

For one thing, contrary to Powers' claim there's no evidence that expanding health insurance has a significant impact on abortion rates. The ACA (and Medicaid expansions that went with it) didn't take effect until 2014. That's the last year we have full data, so at this point we don't really know what effect (if any) the ACA had on abortion rates and we won't until next year when 2015 data is out. But when Massachusetts enacted a universal health insurance program in 2006 (Romneycare), there was no [discernible effect](https://data.guttmacher.org/states/trend?state=MA&amp;topics=65&amp;dataset=data) on the abortion rate. When Tennessee enacted TennCare (a Medicaid expansion program similar to Obamacare) in 1993, there was also no huge impact. TN's abortion rate from 1988-92 (before Tenncare) declined 15%. The rate from 1992-96 (after Tenncare) declined by 9%. So two states that had programs similar to Obamacare did not see their abortion rates plummet significantly. 

Progressive pundits also tend to claim that the contraceptive mandate provision reduced abortion rates by making LARC birth control methods free (Powers doesn't directly make this claim in the video, but does allude to it). Now I think the credit given to LARCs for reducing abortion by journalists, pundits and Guttmacher is overstated but I'll accept it for the sake of argument. Even if LARCs were a huge contributor to the recent abortion decline, that probably had nothing to do with Obama. According to [this](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304042) recent Guttmacher study ""*Reliance on LARC among all contraceptive users increased 130% between 2007 and 2009 and continued into 2011, although at a slower pace.16 Between 2011 and 2014, LARC use increased 48% among clients at federally funded family planning clinics*""

So the largest increase in LARC methods occurred between 2007-2009, before the contraception mandate was signed and it started before Obama even took office. The increases after 2009 were pretty modest in comparsion and probably had to do more with continuing previous trends than anything Obama did. In fact LARC use started to greatly increase when *Bush* was president. So if LARCs deserve much of the credit for the abortion decline then it makes more sense to credit Bush for this since he was president during most of the major LARC increase. 

Now obviously I don't actually think Bush was responsible for the LARC increase but it just shows the absurdity of assuming that correlations of abortion rates with certain presidential administrations equals causation. Also I'm not writing this to endorse the Republican party, but I don't think people should be tricked into voting for staunchly pro-choice Democrats by misuse of statistics.

312,Should policy try to shift abortions to happen earlier?,1,True,"I'm a man with ambivalent views on abortion. I would rather that no abortions whatsoever be performed, but I don't think that's realistic, and I'm unsure of where the line should be for legality. Especially with cases in very early development.

Looking at the statistics, I see that the rates of abortions have dropped steadily over the last decade, likely due (in part) to increased contraceptive use.

A lot of my pro-life friends argue for increased restrictions to make abortions harder. They believe, I think, that making it more difficult to get an abortion (in any form) will reduce the number of abortions. Sort of like regulations meant to reduce the number of suicides by making it harder to get guns or jump off a particular bridge. 

However, some of the proposed and actual policy changes appear to make it difficult for women to get very early (&lt;8 week) abortions. When this happens, I'm concerned that it's also just increasing the number of later term abortions, as women will have to jump through more hoops to get one, and may end up having 2nd trimester abortions instead of 1st.

My question is this: if there were a policy that had 0 effect on the number of abortions, but shifted the ratio of abortions more to the very early stages, would this be considered a positive move by those firmly in the pro-life camp? Or would it be considered a meaningless (or even negative) distinction?

338,Evidence that abortion is actually harmful to women,34,True,"Once the narrative about abortion was shifted to ""women's rights"" and ""choice"" in the '70s, it became a far more difficult battle for pro-lifers to fight. After all, who wants to be known as a sexist, or someone who's against freedom?


Now, I think most of us would agree that this is a clever smokescreen in the abortion industry meant to shift focus away from what's actually happening in the womb. So many discussions end up basically going like this:


Pro-Lifer: Abortion kills an innocent life.

Pro-Choicer: But a woman should have the right to choose.

Pro-Lifer: But the fetus...

Pro-Choicer: But the woman...


There are countless debates where people will simply talk past each other, focusing on two different issues. Most pro-lifers would agree that the fetus's right to life trumps the mother's right to not be pregnant for 9 months, but it's difficult to convince people on this alone. So what if we switched rails a bit and took a new approach? What if we ALSO focused on the mother?


I'm certainly not the first to suggest this--in fact, a big reason I'm making this thread is because of someone's excellent, thorough post on Facebook that I stumbled upon a few months ago and saved on my computer. I regret that I don't remember her name, but here's the post in its entirety (with a couple additional links I added):

---

Up to 64% of abortions involve coercion. A study published in a major international medical journal found that 64% of American women who had abortions felt pressured by others.(1) Coercion can include loss of home, job or family, and even violent assault.(2) 

Up to 83% wanted to have the baby. In a survey of women who sought help after abortion, 83% said they would have carried to term if they had received support from the baby’s father, their family, or other important people in their lives.(3) 

In 95% of cases, men play a central role in the decision to abort according to a survey of women at abortion clinics.(4) 

Husbands and boyfriends threaten women at the clinic. A former abortion clinic security guard testified before the Massachusetts legislature that women were routinely threatened and abused by the husbands and boyfriends who took them to the clinics to make sure they had abortions.(5) 

Dangerous consequences if she resists. Coercion can escalate to violence and even murder.(2) Homicide is the leading killer of pregnant women.(6) 

The “Forced Abortion in America” report includes examples of molesters posing as fathers to procure cover-up abortions and women being fired, beaten, shot, stabbed, tortured or killed for refusing to abort.(2) 

Suicide rates are 6-7 times higher compared to women who give birth. (7)

In short, due to coercion, physical violence, consequence-free sex, and in the case of rapists, ""eliminating evidence"" (ick, I feel dirty just typing that), men benefit strongly from--and women suffer greatly from--lax abortion laws. This doesn't even go into the whole demeaning societal pressure of ""oh, you can't have a job AND kids, so have an abortion"" that women face (and men never hear, for...reasons?).


I think the pro-life = pro-woman angle is a strong one because it DIRECTLY counters the number one reason why people are pro-choice. I'm not saying we should stop mentioning the unborn, but it's handy to have something like this in our arsenal whenever people want to break out the frustrating stereotype that ""pro-lifers just want to control women's bodies.""


A few other fun facts I like to bring up whenever people link pro-lifers to misogyny--pro-lifers in the US are split about 50/50 between men and women, so how can half of the women in the country be ""anti-woman?"" More girls are aborted than boys worldwide, especially in places that abort SPECIFICALLY because the child is female. And finally, in a lot of places, men are MORE likely to vote pro-choice than women: http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/6253

369,trapped into abortion update: still pregnant,60,True,"a little while ago, I made a post about how I was feeling trapped into getting an abortion bc of how young I am and money etc, but I thought I'd do a little update :) 
I'm not going to be posting pictures or details bc I'm not sure whether the father knows of my reddit account
anyway: 14 weeks pregnant, morning sickness has gone down, baby is smaller than she (yes! she!) should be but nothing too worrying.

I'm so happy I didn't decide to have an abortion, I've told my family and they are okay with it, although they definitely don't think I should keep the baby, and I've broken it off with the father, who's pretty upset I think. I think having an abortion would have led to a decline in my mental health at this point.  it's definitely not been easy though, by any means and would no longer consider myself pro-life, just because of my experiences, I think everyone should have a choice 

thanks to everyone who commented on my previous posts to give support and resources, and to those who donated money: a huge thank you, it's been invaluable 

addition: please no congratulations or telling me how much I'll love the baby, just because it ends up hurting me sorry, same goes for religious talk! ",1510487469,54,2017-11-12 06:51:09

We finally admitted to each other last night how we have not felt love for each other in so long and we've hurt each other in so many ways during our period of hurting. We both want it to work but neither of us can really see how it will realistically. We are to see each other this weekend and see how it goes.

386,Thought of another reason to be pro-life - Cerebral Palsy,7,True,"So the rate of abortion for Down syndrome is high, as we all know. The reasoning these people use is something along the lines of they wouldn’t have a full life, wouldn’t be able to thrive, etc. 

Today, I was listening to a talk given by the mother of a girl with Cerebral Palsy, who had no use of almost anything, except her eyes. Cerebral Palsy cannot be predicted before birth because it takes during birth, due to damage of the brain because of, usually, lack of oxygen during birth. Many grown people with CP require someone to be with them at all or most times

So would these same people who support aborting Down Syndrome babies support “mercy” killing CP babies after they’re born? What’s the big difference, other than a little time? 

Also, not all CP cases are as bad as this one, and if it’s a question of mental competence, there are some people with Downs who live somewhat or completely independent lives as well. ",1510184437,3,2017-11-08 18:40:37

425,"How Christians are taking action to support the ""20 Week Pain-Capable"" abortion bill",5,True,"*Introduced early in January of this year, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36) was passed in the House on October 3. It was introduced in the Senate the following day, where the Committee on the Judiciary is currently considering the bill. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Act bans abortion after 20 weeks—the point at which it is widely believed that fetuses begin to feel pain. The bill would penalize those who perform abortions after 20 weeks gestation and not the women attempting to have abortions.*

*As Christians, we believe that each and every human being is made in the image of God; the Christian Reformed Church affirms the sanctity of human life from conception to death. As part of our belief that all human life is sacred, the CRC will continue to advocate for just, holistic programs that support the flourishing of men, women, and children—beginning with unborn lives.*

*This is the third time that the bill has made its way to the Senate, having failed both times prior to garner the necessary votes. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act must be passed by the Senate in order to make it to the President’s desk to be signed into law.*

There is a convoluted argument comparing abortion restrictions to slavery. There are even some defenders of it in law study journals and some more popular ones in feminist-oriented sections of online magazines.

But I think the 'anti-slavery amendment' can be used **against** abortion advocate's reasoning. 

Indeed, case of hostility between the mother and the unborn, it appears to be obvious that the unborn is the enslaved one. The unborn can't possibly change her situation of clear dependency.

In that sense, I think the VIII, XIII, XIV and even XV Amendments could be used to make a case against unrestricted abortion - at least if the SCOTUS (or the Congress) recognizes the moral status of embryo.

437,Doesn't Don Marquis' deprivation argument support the notion that it's more wrong to kill a 35 year old than a 90 year old? Or that it's more acceptable to kill a poor person than a middle class person?,3,True,"I'm asking this question because I want to be able to counter criticisms  of the deprivation argument.  The deprivation argument rests on the contention that killing is wrong because it prevents the person from experiencing future happiness.  Since fetuses have future happiness, it is wrong to kill them under normal circumstances.  A common criticism is that if the wrongfulness of killing is dependent on future experiences, the it would be more morally permissible to kill an old person than a younger person.  Yet this is clearly counterintuitive, most people believe killing old people or young people is equally wrong.  Additionally, if a poor person isn't going to experience much happiness in their life, it is more acceptable to kill them than to kill a rich person who will experience a great deal of happiness.  Also, it would seem to be not very morally offensive to kill someone who is about to be murdered by someone else.

""Imagine a woman is kinapped by a rapist and helt captive for two years. In that time she is raped and gets pregnant, and has a baby. After the two years she and her child are rescued. I mean, this is a thing that's happened.

Why don't we just kill the baby? It's just a baby, it doesn't have any thoughts or opinions. It was conceived by rape, so it doesn't deserve life right? Plus we don't want the mother to have the burden of putting the child up for adoption now that she's birthed it!!""

Does anyone agree with that line of reasoning? Of course not.

Every time a pro-choicer moves the topic to ""but what about rape"" ignore them. This is just a disingenuous tactic to shift the conversation from what THE ENTIRE DEBATE IS ABOUT-

*-PERSONHOOD-*

to ""but think of the wimminz!!!"" No one supports killing the baby in that scenario because everyone agrees the baby is a person. Call them out on this bullshit. They're not interested in a debate. They want to shift the focus from the argument being about personhood to our natural emotional instinct to protect women (an instinct we ironically have due to women's ability to birth children).

And we know why we do this. Because as soon as you're arguing that certain humans aren't people, and therefore killing them is permissible, well that just makes them look like eugenicists.

478,"I wrote this for my irish uni's newspaper, tell me what you think?",11,True,"You wouldn’t know me from Bob in the streets. I carry no badges, hold no signs. It’s my belief that everyone has the responsibility, if not the obligation, to sort out their personal views for themselves, and that making political opinions a core part of your identity invites inflexibility and a black and white perspective in things. So I’ve joined no parties and attended no rallies, choosing instead to quietly research the issues that hold my attention and decide for myself. One of these, very early on in my life, was abortion. 

It’s been a core belief of mine that human life is precious, and that in lieu of actual gods, I believe in Humanity – in our achievements, our power, our capacity for good and decency. I don’t close my eyes to our capacity for evil, either, for greed and selfishness and apathy, but I accept their existence just as I made peace with my own flaws some time ago, and instead of descending into self-hatred and depression, chose to work around them where I could. Every human being on Earth is part of this concept, and deserves equal opportunity to improve themselves and their lot.

On, then, to abortion. Some time now, very soon, the Student’s Union will hold a referendum on whether to officially adopt a stance of being pro-choice. This would mean a group that is supposed to represent some eleven thousand students will make a single, binary choice that in my view will bring nothing but division and alienation, as students like myself will be forced to participate in a system that from their perspective, supports death on an industrial scale. If you imagine the Fianna Fáil TDs [political party] being forced to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown before they were allowed to take office, when they were fighting for Irish independence, that’s more or less how we feel. It is not the SU’s job to interfere in politics that don’t benefit students as a whole, like lower fees, easier visa requirements for international students, or representation in the Senate. 

In order for me make my argument, I must lay out some pre-requisites. I will assume that you actually want to hear my argument, and aren’t simply going to turn the page when you read something you don’t like. I will assume that you believe in the concept of innocence until proven guilty. And I, in turn, will not make passive-aggressive comments, insult the pro-choice position, or otherwise fail to understand where they’re coming from. 

Innocence until proven guilty is a cornerstone of a liberal, functioning justice system. We are out for fairness, not revenge, and the idea of punishing the innocent is so repugnant that William Blackstone famously commented “It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” all the way back in the 1760s, something echoed by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, two of America’s Founding Fathers. In fact they went even further, and said a hundred of the guilty should go free rather than let one suffer. It is the mark of a dictator and a tyrant to punish, not protect, the innocent. 

With that in mind, I cannot in good conscience support the termination of pregnancy. There are no biological indicators that, with complete certainty, say whether a zygote/foetus/baby/bun in the oven is a person or not, and there never can be. Personhood means different things to different people, and by some definitons can’t be determined an organism is able to express their own self-awareness. But if that were the standard, if mothers could determine on their own that it wasn’t really a person and took out the carving knife, there would be outrage, and cries for blood. It’s only when it’s all neat and hidden away beneath a surgical barrier that we feel it’s okay to turn a blind eye. 

I don’t blame anyone who has had an abortion for doing so. As far as I’m concerned, they bought into the idea out of desperation, out of fear and shame. There should be pro-life options for accidental pregnancies, like a streamlined adoption and fostering service, and support services for the terrified women that are searching for easy answers. 

A pregnant woman should be able to go into hospital, have labour induced, and then never have to see her child again if she doesn’t want to. Ireland actually does have a very long list of prospective adoptive parents, and if the process could be streamlined they wouldn’t have to go abroad to find a child, as one of my teachers did in Secondary. It’s not an easy solution, like abortion is, nor cheap nor quick. But it’s the right one, and the solution to “what shall we do with these new people” should never be “Kill them before they arrive”. Similarly, sex education should be widespread, and emphasise birth control including the Pill, implants, condoms, and yes, the morning-after pill.

There’s a website, out there on the Internet, called the Abortion Survivors. This is a support network, intended to work with people who aren’t meant to be here. They had the misfortune to be concieved at the wrong time, the wrong place, or the wrong parents, who “weren’t ready” and “couldn’t give them a real life”. Some of them have disabilities, like cerebral palsy, as a result of this, but I doubt any of them would today prefer to have never existed, to have perished in some hospital ward that normally serves health, rather than oppose it.
I don’t know if writing this has changed anyone’s mind. I expect the referendum will still go ahead, and going by the amount of badges I’ve seen it may well pass. Of course, there could be more like me that I’m unaware of, the badge-less and the sign-less – I wouldn’t know. In the end, my hope is those who wear the badge chose to after considering it carefully, and not because it’s a slogan or popular. And incidentally, I’d like to thank the people reading this last (or so) line, preferably because they read all the other ones – it’s been a long-ish read, and I hope you’ve learned something new from it. Sincerely, I thank you for your time.

I wanted narrow my speech and for the sake of the argument, accept that a fetus is not yet a person (since that is something that pro choicers argue). Then I will argue why potentiality matters, and that abortion is wrong because of you are taking away a fetus' future. I don't want to make it too complicated, because it can only be 6 minutes long. My goal is also not to convert anyone, because people usually have a hard stance on this topic. But I can try to persuade them that even if a fetus is not a person (according to the opposing side) that their potential to become one matters. Does this make sense?

223,Overheard some of my co-workers talking...,5,True,"They were complaining about ""anti-choice"" people and just kind of venting. I don't think they know I am pro-life as we generally do not discuss politics within the office. Even though they weren't speaking directly to me, I hate being made to feel to villainized for my beliefs. They act like the pro-life stance is super militant even though we are the ones taking a non-violent stance and saying killing innocent people is bad. Yet somehow we get made to feel like we're super evil and basically nazis for holding that belief. 

They were also saying how hypocritical it is to be against abortion and yet support the death sentence. I find that line of thinking really disingenuous, like they really don't see the difference between killing innocent babies vs. convicted serial killers? They're obviously very different things with very different lines of justifications.

I just wish pro-choice people would try harder to consider *why* we are against abortion. They act like we just want to control women and watch them suffer and we get joy from their pain or something. No, I just don't want innocent babies killed simply because it would be more convenient for someone if they were no  longer living. I believe in equal rights for ALL humans and do not discriminate based on age and yet somehow I'm the one who's ""playing god""

Anyway, just needed a quick vent in a safe space. Of all the controversial opinions I have, this is the only one I feel afraid to tell people about because people think it's suuuch an evil stance.

229,I feel we are not doing anything close to enough for our cause,15,True,"The WHO (World Health Organisation) estimated around 40-50 million abortions take place every year (according to references stated below). This comes down to about 125,000 a day. 
125,000 babies are actively killed on a daily basis, and society has no quarrel with this. 

Take the Holocaust, considered one of the lowest points of humanity, up to around 6 million Jews were killed over the duration of the Holocaust. Let's say it happened over the 6 years of the second world war (I'm just estimating, I don't know the facts surrounding this), that comes to around 2740 Jews being killed daily. We have a remembrance day for this, we have a moment of silence for this. Yet 125,000 babies are being killed daily right now and no one bats an eye.

It's all good and well to compare these huge figures, but these babies being killed are not just figures, they are individual human beings, being murdered in the place they should be safest. These figures infuriate me, they put me in a state of absolute disbelief. I cannot see how we can just sit idly by, signing petitions and sharing posts whilst this horror continues to exist.

(Just to clear this up, i do not mean to downplay the seriousness and gravity of the holocaust, i do not mean any disrespect to the victims and/or anyone affected by the holocaust)

232,My perfect boyfriend has some overly liberal(?) views on abortion.,8,True,"I use the word liberal because I think that's what he's going for. He identifies as an atheist (which is totally cool, I am kind of, too) and was all about Bernie Sanders, so you can probably guess what kind of person he is. He's extremely smart in his field, but can be really dull in the real world, which is what I'm chalking up his ridiculous views to. We have not disagreed on anything in our time together before this. 

I know that people like him (uber liberal, new age, hipster, etc.) are firm on their stances, so I haven't brought up my views on abortion. It didn't matter. Tonight, I casually mentioned that I'm pro-life. He said he doesn't think just because something has genetic tissue or whatever that it's a human. I mentioned that late term abortions are performed and it's really horrible and he said it's not really an issue because it couldn't survive without it's mother's care even if viable outside the womb.

Wtf? So should we be able to kill newborns? Apparently he thinks so, since they don't have ""higher"" thinking. So when is the cut off? 3 years old??? He didn't have an answer. But it doesn't matter because he said there are too many people in the world... The world can't sustain the population as is.

I'm so confused by this line of thought. It's obviously idiotic and I'm sure he doesn't know what he's saying. But what do I do with this information? How can I talk to him about this topic when apparently he has eugenics in mind or something.

236,Is there hypocrisy in the pro life movement when it comes to arguing that every life deserves protection?,0,True,"This is a bit long, sorry. I'm pro choice but I've been reading up on pro life arguments. Some of it makes sense but I've encountered a major issue that is never addressed or no one is able to answer(my personal thought is it's because it reveals the hypocrisy of the pro-life argument) but maybe you can clarify the issue for me? Just a warning, the topic is sensitive in nature.

Imagine you had a friend that took her baby out swimming one day. While she was swimming and holding the baby in her arms, she loses her grip on the baby and the baby drowns. Obviously, if she did this on purpose, it is murder. However, if it was an accident then it's not her fault, right? It's just a profoundly heartbreaking accident. 
Imagine that, some time later, she has another baby and goes out for another swim. Again, the same thing happens. The mother somehow loses her grip on the baby and the baby drowns. This scenario happens multiple times and results in the deaths of multiple infants. Each time it is 100% truly an accident. Let's say the mom is diagnosed with epilepsy or something and that's why this keeps happening; she keeps having seizures and loses hold of her baby during the fit. At what point does her continuing to bring babies into the water become unethical? She knows that, due to her health, she can not safely carry an infant in the water. Wouldn't it be unethical(and possibly illegal) for her to knowingly bring a child into a situation where they were entirely dependent on her to stay alive and she knew that her body could fail them and result in death? If this was your friend, would you step in and tell her to stop swimming with babies-at least until she got her condition under control? 

Here's another similar scenario, however, instead of focusing on infants, it's about an obligation to protect future or ""potential"" lives....

Imagine a pre-k daycare center was going to open up in your neighborhood. It's not set to open for a few years. Meaning, the future children they would be taking care of when they open don't even exist yet. The problem with this new daycare is that it is going to be run in an unsafe building. The electrical work is basically a fire waiting to happen, the building itself is crumbling, and the roof is bound to cave in. It is an extremely dangerous place to care for children. It's basically a death trap. Would you protest this daycare? Would you fight to save potential future lives? 

I'm sure that, if you were actually faced with these situations, you would be outraged and would voice very loud and clear that both the infants and the future preschoolers deserve to be protected from being placed in any kind of environment that was known to be unsafe for them. 

So what about if a woman has a known health condition that causes her to have multiple miscarriages? Is it wrong for her to intentionally and enthusiastically get herself pregnant? She knows that her uterus isn't functioning correctly and might kill off her baby.  yet, she continually chooses to create a child that is totally dependent on her to live, knowing that her body isn't equipped to keep it alive. Doesn't she have an obligation to save potential children from death and unsafe places just like an epileptic woman shouldn't swim with infants and a daycare shouldn't plan to put kids underneath a crumbling roof? 

Basically, what this whole thing boils down to is: if you argue that every life (no matter the stage of development) has equal value and deserves equal protection, then shouldn't you be outraged over women who have miscarriage after miscarriage yet choose to keep getting pregnant knowing that their body can't keep their baby alive and safe? You would get outraged over a woman continually bringing her babies into the water knowing that her health condition could cause her babies to drown. There would be public outcry if a daycare was going to endanger the lives of future children by putting them in a dangerous building. You would get upset at any parent that would intentionally bring a child into a dangerous or life threatening environment. You would probably want those people to be slapped with manslaughter charges or reckless endangerment of a child. But when it comes to protecting the the potential lives of fetuses from being killed from being put in a life threatening environment? *Hey, that's perfectly okay! Your body your choice! Go ahead and put an innocent life in danger... as long as it's not done by an abortion doctor!*
Pro lifers are even against certain kinds of contraceptives that are considered ""abortifacients"" since, if the woman conceives, the contraceptive might prevent the precious embryo from implanting. According to many pro lifers, it's an evil to create a potentially hostile womb to a potential embryo. So, pro lifers will raise hell about protecting a potential embryo from accidentally being miscarried when it comes to contraceptive use but not when it comes to protecting embryos intentionally being created and carried in a known miscarrying womb that could kill it. 

Isn't there a major hypocrisy issue here? Either the unborn deserve to be protected just as the born are or they don't at all. If you really believe that embryos are people that deserve life like any born person does, you can't just pick and choose what types of unjust/negligent deaths to ignore and not ignore- no matter how inconvenient.

258,"How to counter the ""consent to sex doesn't mean consent to pregnancy"" rhetoric?",11,True,"I've had multiple online debates occur like this, but I'll quote my most recent one because it stumped me: 

&gt;Pro-choicer: Consent to sex doesn't mean consent to pregnancy.

&gt;Me: Sex is ""naturally-ordered"" towards procreation, meaning that pregnancy is its natural outcome. Claiming that you ""didn't consent"" to getting pregnant after having sex is as nonsensical as claiming that you ""didn't consent"" to pooping after voluntarily eating food. The concept of consent isn't even really applicable in this situation. 

&gt;Pro-choicer: This assertion ignores other aspects of sex which are ""naturally-ordered"" and not toward pregnancy, like pleasure, release, psychological fulfillment, etc. 

&gt;Me: That ""pleasure"" derives from the subconscious and instinctual desire to procreate, which further supports the notion that procreation is the natural outcome of sex. 

&gt;Pro-choicer: You have not established that pregnancy is the ""naturally-ordered"" outcome of sexual intercourse. 

&gt;From here, I didn't know what to say. I thought about citing the purpose of the sexual organs but I randomly recalled a Stephanie Gray debate where she asked her opponent about why women have uteruses in the first place (to maintain pregnancy). So, to help support my claims, I lazily asked the person ""why do women have uteruses in the first place, besides for the maintainment pregnancy."" I did this hoping that he would concede my point (somehow). 

&gt;Pro-choicer: You're asserting the equation of a body part (the uterus) with the ""naturally-ordered"" activity (sexual intercourse), but the uterus isn't even necessary for sexual intercourse. [This](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-the-Uterus-Do.aspx) explains that the uterus not only ""directs blood flow to the pelvis and to the external genitalia,"" but also ""provides structural integrity for the bladder, bowel, pelvic bones, and organs as wells."" So, the uterus has other reasons for its existence besides simply maintaining pregnancy. 


From here, I didn't know how to respond. I was being lazy and I blew it towards the end. But anyways, I've followed these guidelines (minus the uterus question) against other pro-choicers and it's never been successful. Can you guys critique my reasoning and provide any supplemental reasons to further support my claims, or should I try a different approach?

274,"If you hate abortion laws in the U.S., it could be worse if you lived just a little more northern.",60,True,"There's a lot of reasons I hate the Canadian government, but its stance on abortion is the most reprehensible to me. The official stance is that any rights given to a fetus would lead to a ""slippery slope"" that would violate women's rights. As a result the fetus is seen as more akin to the woman's property in Canada. It has literally 0 rights. I'll give you 3 examples.

The first is that there is literally no restrictions on abortion, whatsoever. Any girl/woman can get an abortion at any time in the pregnancy, and only has to tell her parents if she is 14 or younger. At 9 months, just days before labor, you can have an abortion and there is no legal way to stop you.

Second is that you can not legally prevent harm to a fetus. Example being if you worked at a bar and a clearly pregnant woman asks for alcohol, you must serve her. If you refuse you can be fired, and the next bartender will serve her anyway.

The third is a case that just boils my blood. There's a famous case here of a woman who drank heavily throughout her entire pregnancy, causing several permanent brain developmental problems, such as fetal alcohol syndrome. The child was always going to require full care. She gave the child up for adoption.

The parents who adopted did everything they could to support the child, but eventually the costs became too much. They attempted to sue the biological mother for a form of child support, but of course that failed because the courts ruled that fetuses have no rights, and since the damage was done as a fetus, no rights were violated.

The pro-choicers always whine that there's no one willing to take care of challenged children. But when they try they block every effort anyway. It seems to me some of them just support eugenics.

So if you're in the U.S., be glad you at least have some restrictions on abortion. It could be worse. You could live here, under this government that had openly stated it will never change it's laws on abortion.

Literally, there are no restrictions whatsoever other than that 14 y.o.'s have to tell their parents). But also because I'm a staunch atheist, but I'm strictly pro-life (I believe life begins at conception). I honestly thought I was the only pro-life atheist.

Anyway, I was thinking about my highschool philosophy class. The first essay topic was to prove you exist, but I answered with cogito ergo sum. He said I wasn't supposed to know that yet so he said he'd give me a harder topic, to prove an 8-month year old fetus is a human being. He said it was hard because our government couldn't seem to do it. I actually really respected that teacher because he's one of only 2 people I know who is pro life, and open about it (here you are shamed harshly if you are openly pro life). He's very religious.

I wasn't very aware of the pro-life movement at the time, so my arguments aren't that original. However, I did get a 98/100 on it, so I think I proved my point. I kept all my schoolwork so I was wondering if anyone here would want to read it.

Me: The fetus is a human being
anti life dude: why?

358,How do you feel about sterilization?,6,True,"I am curious about this community's opinion, on behalf of my sister. 

Neither of us agree with abortion, although I know that she has taken the ""morning after pill"" before (would that qualify as an abortion?). Our mother had an abortion before either of us were born and she regretted it terribly, so we grew up with that in mind.

My sister is currently on the birth control pill, as she never wants to have children and never wants to be pregnant. She wants to get off the pill because she thinks it messes with her hormones and estrogen levels, and there are also health risks involved with it.

Her fear is that in the future, the birth control she is using won't work for whatever reason (a condom breaks, or she is raped and gets pregnant, etc).

364,Pre-EEG wave fetuses aren't human beings?,21,True,"Here's how a pro-choicer replied when asked to define human being:

&gt;Let’s start the basic dictionary definition of a human being: any individual of the genus Homo. Alright we can see the being a human requires some sort of individuality. It requires being something greater than just an identifier. It requires a semblance of development that makes somebody an individual or a developed human organism. Now what makes something an individual? What makes us a human being so to say? The answer, as provided by many institutions, is the brain. The brain enables our body, our mind, our personality. “The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero (28-36 weeks gestation), until the occurrence of brain death. “At any point human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense.” (16 Duquesne Review. 1985)” Harvard Study done jointly with The School of Biological Sciences, University of London, King's College on “When life begins” supporting the EEG perspective. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985Natur.314..492C

Here's another one of their responses:

&gt;An embryo is not a human being, and abortion is not murder. There is no scientific reason to characterize a raisin-size lump of cells as a human being. Biologically speaking, such an embryo is far more primitive than a fish or a bird. Anatomically, its brain has yet to develop, so in terms of its capacity for consciousness, it doesn’t bear the remotest similarity to a human being. This growth of cells has the potential to become a human being–if preserved, fed, nurtured, and brought to term by the woman that it depends on–but it is not actually a human being. Analogously, seeds can become mature plants–but that hardly makes a pile of acorns equal to a forest. It pretty implausible to consider an embryo a person, given that they have little to no nervous system. The fact that an embryo has human DNA does not prove it is a person, because human tissue samples have human DNA and human tissue samples are not individual human beings. Reflex movements and hormonal stress responses provide information about sensory connections at lower levels of the nervous system and cannot be assumed to indicate perception or awareness. For perception or awareness, the sensory information needs to be transmitted to the thalamus, the major subcortical sensory nucleus and then to the cortex, the highest region of the brain

Would there need to be 2 of 3 branches pro life? 3 of 3? 2 of 3 as long as one of the two is the Supreme Court? Are there any scenarios where the Supreme Court would not need to be majority pro life? Would both the House and Senate need to be pro life? Would it need to be a simple majority or a majority like 60+ for instance?

380,A question about making abortion illegal,5,True,"For the record, I am currently neither pro-life nor pro-choice- I am currently on the fence.

I understand that many users here want to make abortion a crime, and after I did some reading on the 2016 election and Trump's comments on abortion, I see that many want to punish the women too. However, this has created several questions in my head.

1. who would be punished here? Would you want to punish the doctor, or the mother, or what? Also, regarding the mother, under what circumstances would you want to prosecute her? Would you prosecute someone who wasn't financially capable to have a baby, or the 13 year old  barely-teenage girl with a small frame and thus a high risk pregnancy  who was frightened and desperate, or the unwilling mother who's pregnancy is driving her to depression and near suicide? Or even a girl who was forced into an abortion? Please explain.

2. How would they be punished? If you wanted to make abortion illegal, would you go and prosecute every woman who has ever had an abortion? On that note- how would you punish them? Would you want a fine, or would you just punish the doctor, or would you just put all women who have ever had an abortion (a pretty large amount) in the slammer and forget about them, and for how long? I'm having difficulty seeing how putting a good fraction of the population in prison is really just, or even economically and practically viable. What about women who regret abortions, or have even become pro life activists? Do you think that they are to be locked up and forgotten about too? Does it also imply that they shouldn't be forgiven?

On that note, do you believe we should help women who have had abortions and regret it? Should we help them and forgive them, or just shame them and lock them up? I know that in the Bible, Paul was responsible for the persecution of Christians and I think was probably responsible for a few executions of them too. However, he converted and was forgiven. I don't recall him being imprisoned or excessively punished for years. Instead, he repented,  was forgiven by God and helped to spread his word. Could we take a similar stance with a woman who has had an abortion?

 I'm still conflicted on what pro lifers believe on this sort of thing, so an explanation would be good. Essentially, in practice, how would it work?

3- Many can argue that pro life supporters have no compassion. Some pro lifers say they do have compassion for women, but I am currently having trouble seeing how you show compassion by wanting to put someone under lock-and-key for the next 20 years. Please explain more about your view of compassion.

On another note, does anyone have any idea or any rough statistics on how many pro lifers actually want to imprison women who have had an abortion, just to see if I'm listening to the majority or the minority?

Also, sorry if I have a hostile attitude here. I just have a lot of questions that need to be answered.

&gt;(2) When people say ""the life of a new human begins at fertilization"", are they referring to the moment when fertilization has started (a sperm penetrates an egg), or when fertilization is complete hours after penetration?

&gt;(3) Because the sperm and egg no longer exist after fertilization is complete, does that mean that there's no such thing as a ""fertilized egg"" within human reproduction? Or is a sperm that's merely penetrated an egg considered a ""fertilized egg?""

However what about suicide? Do you oppose it as well? As a mentally unstabled 18 year old, I have thoughts of suicide and been finding methods that could work but none seem worth it. 

I can understand prolife from abortion cases since the victim (the fetus) cannot consent on a moral standpoint but I do not understand prolife on cases involving self terminations or suicide. Suicide invovles a person taking their own life by their own decision. I am not pro suicide, just pro choice on suicide. Some people have awful lives where they cannot find an option and with the rates rising up in America, I think it is safe to say that no one cares to be honest. Even hotlines are a disgrace since they call 911 or report the suicidal person like as if they are a threat or will kill someone. They are doing an awful job.

393,Update on Toledo abortion clinic disputing state law,11,True,"Toledo's abortion clinic, Capital Care Network, is now at the Ohio Supreme Court against the state over losing their license. They lost their license around 2013 after they were unable to secure a transfer agreement with a local hospital. They made an agreement with an Ann Arbor hospital over 50 miles away, which the state rejected. The clinic argues that the rules imposed on them like the transfer agreement are unfair and 'medically unnecessary'. Recently, it was discovered that a patient who experienced serious complications, including a perforated bowel, was rushed to the hospital. But the hospital didn't call an ambulance or 911, but rather had a nurse working for the clinic sneak the patient to the hospital in a private vehicle, completely in violation of the emergency plans they're supposed to have in place. I am wondering what you think of this. Do you know if the state of Ohio will be able to use this against CCN in their current case? If so, how much will it help? What do you think of these kinds of restrictions? I have links covering this whole thing, including a copy of the Ohio Department of Health report and video of the original incident below.

I don't think the medical technology exists to make this possible yet, or if it will ever. However, obviously if it were possible, this would maybe be an easier solution than trying to convince prochoice women not to abort (and legally as well, as I think a lot of people don't like abortion but they also like being ""prochoice"").

The woman could ""evict"" the fetus to an artificial womb or a willing mother's womb.

It would probably be worth discussing if this is medically possible, about how to make it a reality quicker if so, and what's going on with all this concept.

If I view something as murder, how can I sit by while it happens? I've actually become more and more pro-life recently to the point where it's a single issue for me. If I view abortion as murder, can I be friends with someone who is pro-choice? Would that not make me friends with an advocate of murder? Isn't every moment I do nothing, kinda a black stain of my tacit approval of infanticide? My sister, of whom I'm very fond of, admitted to me that as an OBGYN she's performed abortions before. I haven't really been able to talk to her since. 

I try to stay true to my views. I think all life is sacred, so I don't support the death penalty either and am deeply anti-war. I support more gov aid to mothers who need it to carry their child, and I do support more universal healthcare. But the dems will not meet me half way.

&gt;I don't know about other people here, but typically when I debate an abortion prohibitionist I will challenge their definitions rather than directly testing the limits of their moral assertions and ethnical framework. I'm thinking now that the latter might produce better results because when I challenge definitions often times the person will get hung up on defining humans by human DNA, failing to understand that that is a circular definition which ignores the fact that evolution changes the genome overtime invalidating it as a metric by which humanity can be universally defined accross time (and thus invalidating any universal moral argument against killing humans) as well as failing to understand that a resulting undesirable logical consequence of defining human beings by the genome is that people with chromosomal abnormalities end up being classified as sub-human.

So, I have two questions: (1) What are your thoughts on the idea that human genome ""evolution"" invalidates using human DNA as a universal metric for humanity? (2) And, how would you define ""human"" without circular reasoning?",1504479313,58,2017-09-03 18:55:13

I don't know how to get over this because it feels so crushing that the majority of these redditors, that normally seem like fine people, are okay with and even support murdering babies.",1504095842,57,2017-08-30 08:24:02
446,Quick question: What is the proper way to respond to the parasite argument?,5,True,"So generally when I'm discussing this with someone and we agree on no emotional arguments, that means I can't bring up the joy of life or anything. So they'll usually end up saying the fetus is quite literally a parasite, taking resources and nutrients from the mother. So the mother's autonomy trumps the life of the child because the child is a parasite. Like if someone attached a baby to your leg that just sucked your resources you should legally be allowed to ""remove"" it whatever that means. While this is a horrible way to think, I really don't have a good response for it.",1504046836,8,2017-08-29 18:47:16
448,Argument from Analogy: Conjoining After Sex,0,True,"Edit: Ignore the title. I had a different thought experiment in mind than the one I went with. The conjoining after sex idea was needlessly convoluted.
--
Usually when I present an argument like this some people will respond with how silly the thought experiment is and blah blah blah. So first I need to say that thought experiments are indispensable tools in our kits for moral deliberation. The bodily autonomy argument to justify the permissibility of abortion was famously argued by the thought experiment of the violinist.

I also get people that want to move the goalpost to the nature of morality. So second I need to say that whether or not you believe morality is subjective makes absolutely no difference to my argument. It is irrelevant if you think morality is subjective. The moral argument that I will lay out against the bodily autonomy argument is meant to force those who agree with the violinist thought experiment (or one similar to it) to grapple with an intuition they may have which counters the intuition they have for the violinist scenario.

I'm going to lay out a scenario and I suspect many people will intuit how I do, recognize the morally analogies, and have a hard time pointing out how the analogy breaks down in any important sense.

My goal is not necessarily to get you to give up your belief that ""abortion is OK for the same reason it is OK to kill/let die the violinist."" I have the smaller goal of presenting you with a thought experiment that is just as strong which suggests it's not OK to abort a child. Thus, substantially weakening the appeal of that bodily autonomy move and bringing the debate over abortion where it should be: on the nature of the unborn being that is destroyed in an abortion.

So here is the scenario.

Suppose thousands of years ago a plague hit the world population that rendered virtually everyone infertile. Scientists and engineers got together and developed technology where people come from the ground like plants. The technology only works if two emerge from each sprout. These people are genetically distinct and share no genetic sibling relationship.

Imagine that a disease, due to the reproductive technology, will attack you and your sprout partner at different times in your lives before the age of 20. It is certain to happen. One person might develop signs at 18 and another at 15 or even 3. When one of the people experience signs, then in order to live, they have to be conjoined like the violinist. However, they do not have to lay bedridden for nine months. They can get up and walk around. Imagine the pain and discomfort is similar to pregnancy. You are just dragging a person on a leash-like thing instead of in your uterus.

To keep humanity going it has been instituted in law that it is homicide to refuse to aid your sprout partner.

Nancy sprouts with Sarah. Sarah develops signs at 19 and Nancy refuses to provide aid.

Does she have that right? Does she have that right to deny Sarah aid?

It seems not. And the reason isn't because she has some responsibility to continue the human race. That may have been the purpose for instituting it as law but there is something deeper behind why it is wrong for Nancy to refuse Sarah.

What I think this thought experiment does is suggest that people are people in community. The violinist argument takes for granted that people can be defined as super-autonomous beings with no obligations to anyone else that isn't explicitly or implicitly assumed. But that must be wrong because Nancy does have a very real moral duty to aid Sarah though she didn't choose her own constitution or community or technology from which she came.",1503972132,4,2017-08-28 22:02:12

456,I have Composed a Pro-Life Litany,18,True,"I have written up a piece tying together all arguments against abortion under the sun, here it is.

Abortion is a very contentious issue in the American political sphere. There is a wide difference of opinions on the issue, many say it is an issue of privacy, life, or rights. Opinions run wild across the political spectrum, often creating vitriol. Well, this piece most likely won’t help, but it is the truth and should be said, no matter how gruesome. And that is, abortion should be outlawed by the Federal Government because it is the taking of life, it is immoral, and it is illegal under the U.S. Constitution. These are some hefty claims, but they are more obvious than they may seem.

I want to first start by establishing some scientific fact. The most important fact is, a human zygote is composed of unique HUMAN cells and unique DNA independent of the mother. This very combination makes it genetically distinct from all other humans. (Mayo Clinic) The zygote is a completely different human organism from the mother, and those who would say that it is no different from her appendix in that it is a part of her body that doesn’t contribute have a flawed scientific backing. We understand that all 46 chromosomes are present in the zygote and that they are unique to the zygote. Science is progressing extremely fast and gender can now be determined from a simple blood test of a pregnant woman who is 12 weeks along. (Doctor Testimony) Not only gender, but researchers have found every single trait that chromosomes design for a human in the earliest stages of pregnancies. That would have astounded scientists from the turn of the 21st century and as science progresses more evidence for choosing life abounds. But even with all this new and convincing evidence, we can fall back on some old tried and true principles. The four basic principles of life are organization, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction. The human embryo can meet all of these standards with ease. I would also beg the question, can we use the reverse standard of death, to form a standard of life? Examining further, to be clinically dead, your heart must stop, then would the formation of a heart perhaps mark life? Well, if so, the heart begins to beat on the 22nd DAY of pregnancy, rendering large amounts of abortions murder by that standard ALONE, our previous standards withstanding. But to form a more rigorous definition of death, physicians will often use the stoppage of all brain activity as medically dead. Again, this standard alone would render Embryos life after the 40th day, when brain waves start. (Mayo Clinic)  But with those basic principles determined, let’s look at the testimony of trained OBGYNs and Biologists. The first few individuals I’d like to discuss are Professors at the Science departments of well-respected universities. These people stood in front of the Senate and testified their views on life. Micheline Matthews-Roth, who teaches at Harvard, says this: 
I oppose the use of embryonic stem cells because to obtain those cells it is necessary to kill a growing human being. We know from embryology that a new life begins with the formation of the zygote, the cell formed by the union of egg and sperm in fertilization -- this is scientific fact, not religious doctrine. What makes us human is not our looks or mental attributes, but the human chromosomes and genes which we have in our cells from the zygote stage throughout our life. We should not condone killing a member of our species, even for a good reason. (NPR)
That pretty much confirms the facts stated above. However, there is more, Dr. Alfred Bongiovanni said this : 
I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.... I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life.... I am no more prepared to say that these early stages [of development in the womb] represent an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the child prior to the dramatic effects of puberty...is not a human being. This is human life at every stage. (NAAPC)


Jerome Lejeune, often considered the Father of Modern Genetics, said “To accept the fact that, after fertilization has taken place, a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion. The human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical conception. It is plain experimental evidence.” (NAAPC) I could go on with that exact same philosophy repeated out of the mouths of at least 5 more world renowned scientists who have made such statements, but I think the point is perceived. But, there is one final medical reason for the abolition of abortion. To this I refer to Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the co-founder of NARAL, the largest pro-abort political action group, and Abby Johnson the former Director of Planned Parenthood. Scientific fact says, fetuses can feel pain and react to their surroundings. Neither of the Former Pro-Abortionists believed this. Pro-Choicers will often say that reactions from babies in the womb are not available until 26 week, this has been disproven as above, but it wasn’t until the Now Pro-Life abortion Doctors experienced their first ultrasound abortion.  Early in the 70s, ultrasounds were just being developed, as the first one rolled into Dr. Nathanson’s office, he was thrilled to witness his work. As his colleague began, all that changed. He watched as the baby was pulled apart, he went on to write his book “Aborting America” in which he said, “I am responsible for the death of 60,000” and called abortions “humanity’s greatest holocaust”. He made the film “The Silent Scream” to highlight the process of abortions and what really happens during the process of ending a pregnancy. Little did he know that 40 years later a young woman would experience much the same. As Director Johnson was pulled in to assist on an abortion, she noticed an ultrasound, she didn’t give it much mind, she had never seen an abortion performed, but as the abortion started she saw a fetus pop onto it, she the 13 week old bouncing and swimming away from the forceps that was chasing it like a mad dog locked onto its prey, the fetus fought but lost, as the tool sucked the child apart the child limb from limb. Director Johnson resigned that day and never went back. (Abby Johnson) Those two stories are just 2 doctors among at least 2,500 members of the Pro-Life OBGYNs, a group of doctors who reject abortion and some of them, former abortionists. (AAPLOG) In fact, Dr. Nathanson has repeatedly debunked the false statistic that illegal abortions mean dangerous and deadly ones. Well first, even in a legal abortion, you are losing the life of a child, and consider this on Maternal Death. Firstly, let us consider, how do we know the number before abortion was legalized, we don’t. So any number is purely speculative. Secondly, Dr. Nathanson even said: 
How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In NARAL we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always ""5,000-10,000 deaths a year."" I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose that others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics? The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.


That is pretty damning, but it get’s worse. In 1960 Mary Calderone, a Planned Parenthood board member speculated that 9 out of 10 abortions were performed by licensed doctors and said: they are physicians, trained as such...Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians. In fact, many women have died since abortion’s legalization. But we wouldn’t know because the states with the most abortions (California, New York, et. al.) often don’t need to report maternal death rates. And even in states that do, doctors can record the Cause of Death as, a “hemorrhage” never reported that it was abortion-induced. Now, I concede that here in the states, the data is circumstantial and requires critical thinking, so let’s look abroad for cold hard facts. In Ireland and Malta, the UN reported maternal deaths lower than in the US, and they are extremely Catholic and Anti-Abort nations. And in Poland for another example, the Polish Health ministry reported that maternal death rates dropped when abortions were banned. (FRC) And let’s take a minute to talk about Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood says that 3% of what it does is abortion, but there is a reason why Slate, of all websites, calls it “The Most Meaningless Abortion Statistic ever” and why the Washington Post called it “Very Misleading”. But let’s look at the numbers. According to their annual report, Planned Parenthood commits an average of 325,000 abortions a year. That averages to 1 abortion every 97 seconds. But let’s talk about how much of what they do is abortion, the original query, well, the 325,000 abortions a year divided by last year’s total patient count of 2.5 Million Patients. That mean ONE out of every EIGHT women who walk into a Planned Parenthood, not one in thirty-three, ONE in EIGHT. In fact, they commit 160 abortions for every adoption referral. Let’s talk about what else they do now, they do .97% of the nation's Cervical Cancer screenings, 1.8% of the nation’s Breast Exams, and of course, THIRTY-ONE PERCENT of the nation’s abortions. That’s right, 31%. Let’s not forget they do not offer prenatal care. But that is a PR problem, so how, do they get that 3% figure? They measure everything in “services”. What is a service? An abortion is, but so is a simple pregnancy test. An Abortion which can cost up to $1,500 is weighed the same as a $10 pregnancy test. So if a girl walks in for an abortion, she will get a pregnancy test, the abortion she came in for, an STI test, and a packet of contraceptives. During the visit she got 4 services, she scheduled an abortion, but according to Planned Parenthood, what she did was only 25% abortion. In fact, using this method if all Planned Parenthood patients received an abortion they could claim only 25% of what they do is abortion. Planned Parenthood gives 9.4 million “services”, divide 325,000 by that, you get 3%. And let’s not forget that abortion has a 31% stranglehold on the abortion market, bigger than Samsung on TVs and Chrysler on Cars. So let’s call it for what it is, Planned Parenthood is big business, a big abortion business. One that uses the foulest means of abortion to make a buck. What are those methods, we haven’t even gotten into the full nastiness of Planned Parenthood? We have had doctors from Planned Parenthood talk about using “less crunchy” techniques to harvest the parts of the child. Or perhaps when a different doctor explains the ease with which baby eyeballs and intestines can be extracted. And of course when doctors haggle over the prices of the parts standing in front of a tray filled up with said parts. But it gets much worse when we talk about how the children are harvested. During the first trimester, doctors plunge a tube with an edged tip into the cervix they use the suction part of the tool to rip the child limb from limb while it is still alive and collects it in a vat. This is the type of butchery Director Johnson experienced, it is called Suction Aspiration, but as time goes on, the methods become much more Orwellian. Try Dilation and Curettage where a curette is used to chop the baby up and scrape it right up. How about Dilation and Evacuation, where doctors use forceps to crush the baby, including the now developed Brain and Spine, but this usually results in unusable parts. So what do they use to save the parts, they use Intact Dilation and Extraction, otherwise known as Partial-Birth Abortion. Doctors will use an ultrasound to find a baby’s legs, use forceps to pull them into the birth canal, they deliver the entire baby, except the head, at which point they stab the child in the neck severing the now developed cerebral cortex and ending the child’s life, even while most of it has been delivered into the world. Then, of course, you could side with Former President Barack Obama who supported Post-Birth abortion, that is right, he said that if your doctor somehow botched an abortion before birth, and the child was delivered alive, that killing it post-birth was a protected right. You ask me, that is infanticide. So, I ask, when a fetus can move away and detect the pain and the suffering, how is that a safe medical procedure? When from the moment of conception, you are dealing with new life, how is that a “moral” operation? And that when the vast majority of this operation is performed where a forceps is used to pull the fetus apart, or where a vacuum is used to suck it into a collection vat, sometimes heart still beating, how is that ok by society? And when the biggest medical argument against illegalization is a House of Cards promulgated by decade old lies. How is this an act to be defended? If you ask 2,500 of our nation’s finest caretakers, it’s not, it’s murder. And from the date of this article’s publishment, the cause of death of just under 60 million Americans. Compare that to every American killed by war, 1.2 million.
	
Now that we have covered some scientific reasons against abortions and we have established an unborn child as life, we can delve into the legal world. But to compose any good legal argument for or against abortion, we must look at the crux of the issue in law, Roe v. Wade. The first thing we need look at is what Roe decided. Most Americans would think that Roe created a limited right to abortion. In fact, the court did just the opposite, they said, We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. (Roe v Wade) Ok, fair enough, that decision is from 1973, scientific evidence for Life wasn’t nearly as strong, however, instead of cautiously allowing science to deliver an answer, or revise the decision once evidence came out, they created an unlimited right to be abortion, albeit one that can be stymied by States at the arbitrarily created “point of viability”.  However, we can also find a sentence in the ruling in Roe’s companion case, Doe that says this : We agree with the District Court, 319 F.Supp. at 1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors --physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient. (Doe v Bolton) That means that a doctor can override a restriction if he deems a woman in “emotional” duress because of carrying a pregnancy to term. In fact, we can even look at the cases of abortions being defended by the Prosecutors, the woman that sued Texas and Georgia, were in fine health and simply did not want to carry the child to term. (FRC) Now you may ask, “Where did this ruling come from, surely the Court must have had a Basis?” Well, that basis came from a “right” not even written in the Constitution. Both the Doe and Roe ruling reference an inherent Right to “Privacy”. The word privacy is never even used in the Constitution. (Constitution) This “right” to privacy that was ruled upon, made abortion completely an issue of Women’s Health. Well, we have established life from conception and when the court overlooked it and wrote that they need not determine life to rule on it in the earliest stages, they effectively made complete abortion legal, on a basis of a “right” not found in the Constitution. When the court authors an opinion, that sends the signal for ALL law enforcement to uphold EVERY single letter of it, sometimes that can have ill wished consequences. In fact, even Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sees it as an issue of equal protection, and not “privacy”. She even said in an interview with a Kansas newspaper “It is not the way courts generally work”.  And even off the bench, Pro-Choicers are singing a similar tune with John H. Ely of Yale saying: “because it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”  And best of all, the Clerk of Justice Blackmun, the authoring Justice, called it: “one of the most intellectually suspect constitutional decisions of the modern era.” But beyond just mere opinion, there are verifiable sources in U.S. Law. For example, When we look at the 5th and 14th Amendments, they contain what is called the Due Process Clause. In the 5th it reads: nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. And when we take a look at the 14th, it sounds rather familiar: nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. To me, having established life at conception, that seems rather a clear cut, but there is, even more, some would have the fetus exempted from citizenship, but as a fetus is a person, that comes into conflict with both Title 8 of U.S. Code and Article II of the Constitution. Both establish that birthright means citizenship. We can find that from the apparentness of Life at Conception, there is citizenship. Even the American people as a whole seem to be catching on, 61% of Americans believe that once a fetal heartbeat begins, abortion should be illegal, as we have discussed this occurs much earlier than most would think. In fact, Most Americans, 53%, would not overturn Roe, however, when explained that Roe creates an unlimited right to abortion, that contrast these numbers, only 6% of Americans agree with this unlimited right, 86% agreeing with banning 3rd trimester bans, 72% with 2nd, and a further 61% with heartbeat bans as said above. (Gallup/Ipsos)  However, these numbers do drop in the cases of rape or incest. If we delve further however into this issue, we see in a survey conducted by the Pro-Choice Guttmacher Institute, we see some interesting polls on why abortions happen. We see that 92% of abortions are purely elected. Less than 1% are Incest and rape driven, combined. And even then, I ask, why should a child get the Death Penalty for the crimes of the father. Why should a child conceived in rape, be executed, when even in the 2008 case of Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court ruled that a 400 lbs. man that raped his 8-year-old stepdaughter could not be put to death and overruled his sentence given to him by the Louisiana jury. (Kennedy v Louisiana) If even HE cannot be legally executed, a child rapist, why should any child conceive of rape be murdered for their father’s heinous crime, when he himself, cannot be? This among the myriad Constitutional provision and standing legal precedent is why the illegality of abortion is truly the most unenforced standing law in the nation, at a dire cost.


The final field in which we examine abortion’s many nuances is its morality. This topic trickier than either Medicine or Law is often divided into two camps, Morality from Religion, and Morality based on secular foundations. There is an argument against abortion to be derived from both. For the religious viewpoint, we can look no further than the Bible itself. But before I delve directly into the verses that I find most damning, there is an elephant in the room. The Bible NEVER specifically references abortion. For one reason only, in the time before Jesus until afterward when Paul composed the final books, abortion was so unthinkable that it was an unwritten law. Infertility was seen as a curse, and pregnancy a gift, so the Prophets didn’t need to write anything about its evil. That view about the sacredness of the family had vanished, but the Bible, and its verses on the beauty of God and his gifts haven’t. The first few verses are about King David and his relationship with the divine. Starting with Psalms 139: 13-16 which reads: 
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.My substance was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
This reaffirms Genesis 2:7 which says: And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. Both of these powerful passages make a point to say how much care that God puts into forming babies in the womb. But there is much more, in Psalms 51:5 we see the truth, that unborn children are responsible for original sin from conception when it says: Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. And in Genesis on 3 separate occasions is the likeness of God confirmed, in 1:26-27, 5:1, and 9:6. And again, we can see that, though God’s perfect image was affected in the fall of man from Eden, it was not erased. This can be read in 1 Cor. 11:7 and James 3:9. We can also see in Romans 5:12 and Hebrews 7:10 that the unborn child receives original sin and is morally accountable at conception, as all unbaptized humans are. Romans reads: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. And in Hebrews, we find: For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. And even beyond this level of biblical morals that God wishes to follow, we must look no further than Exodus 21:22-25 to find the sanctity of the pregnancy in Jewish culture. In Exodus it says this of the death of unborn: 
 If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.


To me that is rather clear that the death of an unborn is taken just as seriously of that as a born child. At this point, I think that everyone that treats the Bible with great reverence as a book of worldly wisdom has come to understand the immorality that abortion embodies. But even for Secular folks, their philosophies as decent people are sure to be challenged by the non-religious issues posed. The first few standards are imposed by Roe. Beginning with what was discussed earlier, Roe draws some lines, one of the most infamous being that of the viability point. Ruling that before a child is viable to survive outside the womb, abortions ought to be legal, however, the first bit of our time together was disputing when a child became life, and that was conception. Life is Life, even if it needs to be nurtured. Would you consider a deer that was hit by a car and needs to be nurtured and have medical attention to not be alive, even if you left it alone it would die? Would you feel this way of your grandmother of brother that needs emergency care? This is the standard Roe set, and it’s unacceptable. Another hallmark of Roe is their trepidation separation of separating humanity from personhood. The ruling confirmed, that even if a human, the legal definition of “persons”, may not apply. This opened up a way for some radical definitions of personhood to be proposed. Ones that proposed, not biological definitions of life or personhood, but cultural ones. Francis Crick said with Nature magazine a child was considered to be legally born when two days old, it could be examined to see whether it was an ‘acceptable member of human society. And it was famed Anthropologist Ashley Montagu that stated A newborn baby is not truly human until he or she is molded by cultural influences later. (Probe) And Professor Joseph Fletcher perhaps holds the most blood-curdling view, writing in his book, Humans without some minimum of intelligence or mental capacity are not persons, no matter how many of these organs are active, no matter how spontaneous their living processes are. (Probe) He would go on to use 40 IQ as a benchmark for personhood.  These are not just arguments supporting abortion’s supposed morality, but infanticide, and the last one, the murder of the most vulnerable in society. Now that we have covered some of the current standards imposed by the courts, and the opinions on them, we can look at the true value of the unborn. Now, some people would say that fetuses have no rights. This included the Democratic nominee for President this year, Hillary Clinton. (Richardson) However, even IF an unborn child is not a person, and we can disregard all juxtaposing information on that and the life of the child, I would ask this. Even if the child is not a person, why is it afforded no rights? There are many animal rights groups, surely they don’t think that the animals are people, but they do believe they have rights. I myself agree, they are living beings and should be treated respectfully. However, many of the members of these animal rights groups, such as PETA, take an interesting stance on abortion. MANY members of animal rights groups are rather militant liberals, yet, when they say they animals should be given rights perpendicular to human rights, they omit the unborn. They never seem to say, “Hey at least in some stage this baby becomes a baby”, even if they don’t recognize life at conception as modern science had granted us. This hypocrisy really is both repulsive and mind-boggling. But it doesn’t get any better from there. A fetus has value, I think we can all agree, an infinite value in fact, of endless possibilities of a new person in the world. When a mother plans on carrying a baby to term, that baby is seen as having almost infinite value, yet, when pulling in for the insidious practice of abortion, that value goes away. Why doesn't the mother get to decide the value of her child? And say, in a tragedy, a pregnant woman, is murdered, the assailant is charged with murder of course, but how many times? Two counts, or just one? Does the death of the fetus mean another murder to be prosecuted for? Hard to say, but if you follow liberal abortion theory the answer is clearly no, that life is not found in the womb. Now that we have discussed some philosophy and principle behind the issue, I want to paint you a picture. Imagine a woman. Her husband has just left her, and she is to move in with her parents. However, she has a problem, her parents don’t know what she does. The absent father impregnated her and she is faced with a choice. Does she get an abortion or not, being a devout woman she goes to the nearby church and is convinced to choose life. That woman’s name is Ann Dunham, she is no longer with us, but her child is. You see, thirteen years after Ann had passed, her son was elected the first Black President in American history. The man that supported radical abortion, was the very one who grabbed life from its deadly jaws. The woman who wasn’t quite ready for a child gave birth to a leader of the free world (By The People), so I would implore all mothers, before choosing an abortion, think about the unlimited value your child could possess. So after all that heavy moralism, I want to end on a happy note. Just something in our society that already recognizes life in the womb. If you believe that a baby is part of a mother’s body, do walk up to her and say, How’s your Body? No, I would hope not at least, you say How’s the Baby? You recognize that the baby is a separate being with its own welfare. These values are recognized across the spectrum of humanity, from the secular to the non-secular. They aren’t values that can be easily cast aside nor should they, they just need be exposed to shine their proud light, much like the children they protect.

So, now that I have presented the facts, the evidence, and the morals, it is your turn. I would ask you to understand the medical evidence, the law, and the beliefs of the philosophies of the world, ranging in value. And I would ask you to choose a side, choose what you can do to help society, and after all that I have said about the above, I would plead you, choose life.

466,Are These People Serious?,31,True,"There's some articles going around right now (I don't want to give them clicks so haven't linked) on Teen Vogue, Vice, etc. freaking out about a CPC in Belfast encouraging centers to light baby powder candles so the clinics will smell like newborns. Some pro-choice groups are calling this ""deceptive"" and ""manipulative.""

So first of all I thought the problem that pro-choicers had was CPCs presenting themselves as abortion clinics. Just lighting a candle that smells like a baby is not deceiving anyone. It's just lunacy to think it is. They're also saying that the candles are meant to ""trick"" women that want abortions. If pro-choicers think that women can be tricked by candles than they have a lower view of women than they claim. 

Then someone from BPAS complained that most women who have abortions already have kids so they know what a newborn smells like. If that's the case then why are they getting their panties in a twist about it? It's not like lighting a candle is pretending to be an abortion clinic or fake medical information. If women aren't going to be convinced by this than what's the big deal?

Last, this is the offensive tweet in question:""Stanton Healthcare would recommend to all crisis pregnancy centre's the new baby powder yankee candle. It just smells like a new born baby.#lovelife #lovebabies #protectthemboth#loveyankeecandles""

It's not exactly rocket science exactly why a facility focusing on parenting and pregnancy care would want to smell like a newborn...they didn't mention abortion at all in the tweet. 

Edit: Also, ever since its Belfast opening, Stanton has made it very clear that it is a pro-life clinic. There's no way a woman could walk in there and think it's an abortion clinic. Articles claiming that Stanton is attempting to lure in women who want abortions and trick them with candles are pure slander. ",1503444397,7,2017-08-22 19:26:37

Here's a compilation of their comments that they copy-and-paste on a lot of pro-life pages: 

&gt;Abortion is not murder because it does not take the life of an individual human being. The reason for this is that the fetus has not met the baseline neurological criteria detected by an EEG wave to be considered life when an abortion happens. The medical and scientific definition of what constitutes Life is determined by Electroencephalogram (EEG). If you no longer have EEG, you are considered “brain dead” which is legally and scientifically the definition of death, despite your beating heart, (a heartbeat is not valid determining factor for life). Those who are brain dead show no clinical signs of brain activity including no response to pain and any cranial nerve reflexes. This is very similar to the condition the fetus is in before it develops a distinct EEG pattern. This means an organism such as a fetus is by definition,is not alive due to the lack of EEG, which means a fetus cannot be murdered. only disposed of. A fetus does not achieve the baseline neurological capacity to be considered alive till 28-36 weeks. By legal, scientific and medical definition, abortion is not murder. Here is a medical reference and study done on EEG Criteria and establishing it as the fundamental definition of when life begins by the medical and scientific community {Source:http://www.svss-uspda.ch/pdf/brain_waves.pdf}. http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~rik/courses/cogs200-w05/readings/GazzNeuroethicsJI-1.pdf

^ Here's their explanation of why abortion isn’t murder because the fetus isn’t alive at the time of the abortion (part 1 of 5)

&gt;One of the reasons that the EEG argument is considered sound and is respected as the definition of when life begins is because it is supported and endorsed by literally every single prestigious medical clinic and institution. There is not a single reputable organization that says life begins at conception. Princeton University, the number 1 ranked college in the United States, has endorsed the EGG viewpoint as ""the most accurate measure of function for determining life"" and put the time frame of a measurable and distinct EEG wave around 28 to 36 weeks. With a 4 to 5 week margin of variability. This time frame happens well beyond when abortions occur, so from this we can consequently conclude that on a factual basis abortion is not murder. Also please keep in mind that the EEG viewpoint is endorsed by Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious medical centers in the United States. Many reputable scientific organizations and centers have made similar statements endorsing the EEG argument. Due to backing from the medical establishment, we can accept this proposal as scientific fact. Here is another report from the Medical School at Stanford University that confirms the EEG as the most accurate, reliable and scientifically valid measure of life. Jed Rubenfeld, Stanford Medical Review Vol. 43, No. 3 (Feb., 2011), http://www.jstor.org/stable/1228913 
The organizations that support the EEG Argument include: Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, The Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center, Oxford, Cambridge, the National Institute of Health Sciences, the National library of Health. The American Academy of Pediatrics, The American Medical Association, The American Public Health Association, The National Education Association, The National Medical Association and plenty of other prestigious medical organizations.

^ Here's their explanation of why abortion isn’t murder because the fetus isn’t alive at the time of the abortion (part 2 of 5)

&gt;Although most cultures identify the qualities of humanity as different from other living organisms, there is also a universal view that all forms of life on earth are finite. Implicit in the later view is the reality that all life has both a beginning and an end, usually identified as some form of death. The debate surrounding the exact moment marking the beginning of a human life contrasts the certainty and consistency with which the instant of death is described. Contemporary American (and Japanese) society defines death as the loss of the pattern produced by a cerebral electroencephalogram (EEG). If life and death are based upon the same standard of measurement, then the beginning of human life should be recognized as the time when a fetus acquires a recognizable EEG pattern. This acquisition occurs approximately 28-32 weeks after the conception of the fetus and is the basis for the neurological view of the beginning of human life. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a simple medical procedure in which electrodes are attached to different locations on a patient's head and the voltage difference over time is measured between the two points. The voltage data is plotted against time to produce ""brain waves"" with up and down voltage oscillations that are representative of the organized electrical activity of the brain. Medical professionals use a patient's EEG pattern to identify a broad spectrum of mental states. There is a strong argument that the unique and highly recognizable EEG pattern produced by a mature brain is a defining characteristic of humanity. Therefore, the moment that a developing fetus first exhibits an EEG pattern consistent with that of a mature brain is indicative of the beginning of human life. It is from this point and onward during development that the fetus is capable of the type of mental activity associated with humanity.

^ Here's their explanation of why abortion isn't murder because the fetus isn’t alive at the time of the abortion (part 3 of 5)

&gt;The evidence of neurophysiology and psychology suggests most powerfully that the functioning of life depends on the operation of the brain…When direct evidence shows that a fetus conscious, the electrical rhythm of a fetus's brain, it’s EEG, is found to have a certain pattern. The EEG varies with the kind of consciousness—there is one kind of EEG rhythm for intense thought, another kind when a man is mentally inactive but awake, another kind when he is dreaming…; and there are different rhythms for sleep of different kinds, when the man has no recollection of dreaming…EEG rhythms are thus indirect evidence of consciousness. This means, at the very least, that life cannot occur in the fetus until it has something that counts as a brain. Then it follows that life cannot occur in the fetus until it has a brain. Of course, in this context, the application conditions for the locution ‘‘having a brain’’ will necessarily be somewhat vague, as there is probably no moment in fetal development that can plausibly be characterised as the moment at which the fetus goes from a being without a brain to a being with a brain. It will certainly be possible, however, on the strength of the empirical evidence, to confidently conclude that zygotes lack brains. Thus, if substance dualism is true, personhood and life cannot begin at either conception or implantation.

^ Here's their explanation of why abortion isn’t murder because the fetus isn’t alive at the time of the abortion (part 4 of 5)

&gt;This is why we know abortion is not murder. Because this is where the facts and the science have led us. And potentiality isn't argument here. When Jimmy Carter was six years old, he was a potential president of the United States, but even though the president of the United States has the right to command the armed forces, it does not follow that six-year-old Jimmy had even a very weak right to command the armed forces, let alone a right on a par with actual presidents. This example shows that potential rights do not entail actual rights, and that the assumption needed to ground the potentiality argument must be rejected. The potentiality argument akin to saying that a Home Depot is the same things as 100 houses because it holds that potential. How can a biological entity that has no nervous system be considered life? First, if a zygote should be protected because it can from a human being, why not also protect the sperm and eggs, for they can form a zygote which in turn can form a human being. The second, a major flaw, is that being potentially something isn’t the same as being something already. To see this, consider extrapolating the potential argument in the other direction: all human beings will die. And, seeing as a zygote will form a human being who will later form a corpse, it follows that we should treat both people and zygotes as if they were corpses. If we can give the right to life for an unborn baby, maybe we should give the right to a decent burial for a pre-dead corpse (i.e. a live baby). Not to mention that skin cells can replace sperm in forming a human being, so it follows that each skin cell destroyed is akin to destroying a human being. Unless, of course, having the potential to do something or be something isn’t equal to actually doing or being it.

^ Here's their explanation of why abortion isn’t murder because the fetus isn’t alive at the time of the abortion (part 5 of 5)

&gt;A fetus does NOT meet the requirements for life. The requirements it does not meet are: Homeostasis–NO, does not meet. The mother is in charge of maintaining homeostasis for both them and the baby. Growth–NO. The baby grows, but it is not independent. It is due to the mother. Reproduction–NO. In order to be considered capable of reproduction, you must either HAVE or HAVE HAD those mechanisms. A fetus at this point does not meet the criteria. What about women who have had their uterus removed, you ask? They are still very much alive, because they once HAD that mechanism.

^ Here's their explanation of why the unborn don’t meet the qualifications of life. (Part 1 of 3) 

&gt;Without its co-ordinating action, the organs of a body would be like discordant instruments in a conductorless orchestra - functional perhaps, but unable to play together anything recognisable as a musical composition. Consider, if you will, the case of an eighty-year-old person in an intensive care unit. Let us assume that he or she is being maintained on an external mechanical respirator. This eighty-year-old may be terminally ill, may not be able to survive without the respirator. But if that human being has a functioning brain, there is no doubt on the physician's part that he is dealing with a living patient. What is to be done for or to that patient is a wholly different set of decisions which may be made upon the basis of many other considerations, but no one would doubt that that human being is alive despite the fact that many bodily functions were being maintained mechanically. Consider similarly a fetus. It is inside the most advanced intensive care unit ever designed - the uterus. And it is being maintained by the most complex extracorporeal respirator known - the placenta. If this fetus has reached the age of 28 weeks, a wealth of evidence indicates that its brain has begun functioning electrically. What is a matter of fact is that medically if a fetus is analysed in the same way as a born human, then at 28 weeks gestation with a functioning brain present, it is a living human being in the biological sense of that term. In fact I would argue that when the fetus has a functioning brain, one cannot advance any logical argument to show that that fetus is not a living human being, at least from the point of view of medicine.

^ Here's their explanation of why the unborn don’t meet the qualifications of life. (Part 2 of 3) 

&gt;Growth is non independent for a fetus. It is not a factor for life. A heartbeat isn't a factor for life.
1) Physicians have always had a working definition of human life because they have for centuries been called upon to declare death. The definition of death, may imply its converse - a working definition of what constitutes life.
2) With regard to this 'medical definition of human life', there is no reason from the point of view of physiology why fetal humans should be viewed as different from born humans.
3) A consistent theory of human beginning has potential implications for making ethical decisions and can go a long way towards making ethical choices clearer, and may serve to point the way to a broadly acceptable societal ethical consensus. And it can minimise the amount of uncomfortable paradoxes which can occur using other definitions of biological humanness. Regardless of culture, physicians or those who take their role in society have been required to know when human life has ended. Physicians, therefore, very early recognised that there were certain 'vital functions' necessarily required to maintain life. When these ceased, a person was dead. The practitioner therefore chose to measure various 'vital signs' as indicators of the presence or absence of these necessary functions. This practical approach is still in clinical use and all that has changed over the centuries has been the sophistication of measurement, and assessment of which vital signs are of paramount importance. From time immemorial, the most important 'vital signs' were heartbeat and respiration, and clinically these are still the primary indicators of the state of a patient. However, in the past two decades science has developed an ability both to replace respiratory and cardiac function mechanically or to transplant the heart and lungs, thus restoring lost functions. Fortunately, it had long been clear that the brain, the seat of consciousness, emotion and an individual's unique personality held the most central vital function in the body.

&gt;I see this everywhere. This site is literally cited by every pro lifer. It's the only ""evidence"" they can bring up to support their misinformed view. Let's clear up the record here. First off the actual website itself has nothing to do with Princeton University. The website itself was created by a student. It is simply a collection and compilation of pro life quotes and sources. Many of these links are outdated by more than 30 years and are usually from religious organizations. The site itself has no medical or scientific background. It has no backing from the medical community or any real evidence to support its argument. Overall it is NOT a valid source and DOES NOT count as evidence or fact, since it is simply a collection of OPINIONS, which do not constitute as facts. For something to be accepted as a fact in the medical and scientific realm it must be endorsed and backed by a host of Institutions or Clinics. The ironic thing is that Princeton University itself as an institution collectively endorses and supports the EEG perspective which shows an abortion is not murder.

&gt;The group was founded in 2002 by a group of pediatricians, including Joseph Zanga, a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as a protest against the AAP's support for adoption by gay couples. The group's membership as of 2016 is estimated at 500 members. The American College of Pediatricians has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a ""hate group"", with ""a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people"". A number of mainstream researchers, including the director of the US National Institutes of Health, have accused ACPeds of misusing or mischaracterizing their work to advance ACPeds' political agenda. The group wants you to confuse them for the American Academy of Pediatrics, the 86-year-old group that represents 60,000 pediatricians across the United States. But ACPeds was founded in 2002 by a fringe group of doctors angry that the American Academy of Pediatrics recognized same-sex couples as loving, capable adoptive parents. They won’t say how many members they have, but reports peg the number at less than 200. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated ACPEds as a hate group.

&gt;Premature babies which represent a very small portion of births, develop brain activity at the time of viability. So the fetus will gain its nuerological capacity or EEG wave right as its born or as soon as it reaches the lower bound of viability. That is why your picture doesn't invalidate the EEG perspective, because for all the women who get an abortion normally, the fetus at the time of procedure does not have the nuerological function to be considered alive. Princeton’s following argument for the organized cortical brain activity criterion:
P1: You and I have a right to life in virtue of those qualities that distinguish
us from the rest of the animal kingdom.
P2: Those qualities that distinguish us from the rest of the animal kingdom
arise from our having organized electrical activity in our cerebral cortexes.
C1: You and I have a right to life in virtue of our having organized electrical activity in our cerebral cortexes.
C2: Fetuses acquire a right to life when they acquire organized electrical
activity in their cerebral cortexes. https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article-abstract/10/3/237/897368/Neuromaturation-of-the-Human-Fetus

There is one pro-choice position that I haven't heard a rebuttal to. In fact, off the top of my head, it is *the* most convincing pro-choice position and the hardest one to refute. I would love to hear your guys' response to it.

The argument is the can of worms you open up when you dictate that the government shall place the right to life over the right to bodily autonomy. See, by being pro-life on a governmental level, meaning you believe that the government should legally stonewall people from seeking abortions, even in cases of rape where the woman cannot be considered to have consented to the risk of being a parent...

Are you saying that the government has a place forcing you to undergo medical procedures against your will?

Suppose there are sufficient deficiencies in organ, marrow, blood, kidney etc. donations and people are dying or about to die as a result. If you are asserting that the government has a place forcing women to undergo pregnancies against their will for the sake of saving a life, then how can you refute the prospect of the government conscripting random people to be forced to donate to save lives? What is the differing variable that makes this morally unacceptable, but that makes forced pregnancy morally acceptable? (Or are you willing to tell me you find forced transfers morally acceptable)?

You might say ""well, you had no agency in the creation of the issue that those people faced"". As I learned [the last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/6etkws/people_who_want_abortions_to_be_outlawed_but/) I posted here, a lot of you guys actually don't think rape should be an exception for abortions. So then consider this extreme case: what if you cause a car accident where *you* are at fault, and the victim of the accident is badly injured and has kidney damage. At the hospital, it is determined that a kidney transplant, or some combination of blood/plasma transplant, from a compatible donor like yourself, is needed to save the victim's life. The only you can save the victim's life is to undergo a medical procedure.

Now this is just like cases of consensual sex -- you, by your own bad choices, created a situation  where a person requires your body to survive. You were at fault. So if you are pro-life, then how can you morally condemn the government forcing you against your will to undergo a procedure to save the victim's life?

I am interested in hearing your guys' response to this. I believe that understanding those who disagree with you is important to intellectual growth, so I hope to learn something today.",1502056045,16,2017-08-06 17:47:25

Thankfully, she was strong enough to brush me off, and fight to give our daughter life. I was only able to see my daughter for a while before we had to give give her up for adoption. I don't deserve to be called a father, but I've seen the error of my ways, I've been on your side for the last three years since.

183,Can someone help me in forming my pro-life justification and argument?,8,True,"I've been forming my own pro-life argument for some time now, and I've given it a lot of thought, but I'm certain that some people here have some pointers to help me. I'd like if you could even tear down my argument and help me counter anything you believe to be a fallacy. For the most part, I think I'm fairly consistent, but I'm certain my bias shows without my awareness. 

Anyways, here is the outline of my pro-life justification:

If we are going by the basis that everyone has intrinsically equal value. No one has the ""right"" to kill someone else. Then we can not draw arbitrary standards as to who possesses that value. History repeats itself. Throughout history, larger groups of the population have persecuted minority groups with the sole excuse that those minorities are ""sub-human."" Notably, slavery was accepted for thousands of years, and still is to some capacity. The justification for the slaveowners for this was that the slaves they claimed to own deserved less rights than them. And the excuse for that has always varied to some degree. Genocides throughout history, as well as today, have and are justified by the belief that the genocide of a certain sub-group of a population either lost, or never had the right to live. 

Now, I'm not arguing that slavery nor genocides are necessarily ""wrong."" In fact, no one can prove for a fact that everyone does have equal rights. There is a possibility that no human has a right to anything from a nihilist perspective. And, like I said, I can not prove them to be incorrect. However, as I stated earlier, if we are to successfully govern ourselves with the moral standard that everyone has equal rights regardless of sex, race, sexual orientation, creed, religion, age, or anything whatsoever, then we must uphold that principle. 

This would need to apply to all human life. And it is a biological fact that can no longer be disputed that a life in the womb is an individual life. Perhaps, from a nihilistic perspective, where human rights can be disregarded, and possibly for good reason, a zygote, embryo, or fetus can be disregarded as a person. But from the perspective that everyone has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, abortion is murder. To ignore this fact, would be to ignore the very basis of the United States Constitution and Judeo-Christian influenced Western philosophy itself. You may argue that abortion is justified because not  all life is created equal, and then I will concede to you, because I can't prove you to be incorrect. But since it is a fact that a life in the womb is just that, you can not claim to uphold civil rights for all if you excuse the violations of even one individuals rights.",1501957619,20,2017-08-05 14:26:59

196,A question regarding abortion,9,True,"So I originally posted this on r/TrueChristian and was linked here so I decided to ask here as well.

So, just to get it out of the way, I am a single male, so this does not link to any situations of mine (and hopefully, not in the future either). However, I have a couple of questions about abortion.

I know that, on the whole, abortion is condemned in Christianity. However, it is a very complex issue. I'm just curious as to see if you guys can offer your opinions, or testimonies if you feel comfortable in doing so.

Anyway, here are my questions.

1. What if a baby is conceived as a result of rape or incest?

2. What if having the baby will cause significant threat or certainty of death of the mother? (I.e. ectopic pregnancy or a cancer of which treating would cause considerable harm or death of the baby, or death of the mother if untreated and baby is born)

3. What do you think would be a viable alternative to abortion? Do you think that pregnant mother's should be offered support in order to make raising the child financially viable?

4. Do you think abortion should be made illegal? 

5. Many argue that it should be illegal, but others argue that making abortion illegal would only make the problem worse via illegal abortions, which can cause permanent damage or death to the mother, without significantly lowering the number of abortions. What do you say to that?

6. If you met a woman who already had an abortion, what would you say to them?

7. If someone was planning on having an abortion, what would you do? Would you try to talk them out of it, and what would you say to them (this is a hypothetical I don't need to talk myself or someone out of one, but I would like to know what you would say)

8. Often, I see images of pro-life supporters holding up pictures of dead babies. Do you think this is right, do may this cause distress to someone who had an abortion (including if they regretted it)?

9. Many pro-choice supporters think you are ""pro-birth"" only and don't care about what happens to the child after it has been born. Please counter this point.

10. If the child is born with a severe medical condition (such as trisomy 18), what should be done then? Should it be aborted to spare it a painful and agonizing exist, or should it be born as it's existence is just as valuable? (Don't mistake this for passive-aggressiveness, it's just that I saw it in the comments of an article that was linked in this sub and the question popped into my head)

Like I said, this is a controversial and taboo subject. However, I would like to hear your thoughts.

219,Why does someone always have to bring up their support for abortion whenever something happens to a child?,32,True,"I was reading a thread about a woman who left her 1 year old in a car for six hours while she got her hair done. The child obviously died. There was post after post about how horrible the woman was, and how her baby didn't deserve to die, etc. But amidst all of that there's one post in which the person says, (paraphrasing) ""this is why I support planned parenthood, and free access to abortion, because.....""

I don't get this at all. The child obviously suffered greatly in that car, but according to her family, she was a happy child and had a (seemingly) good life before this happened. Everyone was fawning over the pictures of her smiling and being a normal baby, so why would someone imply that she ought to have been eliminated to avoid this whole event? How would that have helped her? It seems like it still ends up being less about the actual child and more about the woman, and the outside world (and their feelings). 

The mother:
1. Won't have to be charged with murder, because she eliminated her child before she was born.
2. Can go to the hair salon all she want's

The rest of the world:
1. Won't have to feel bad about seeing that cute a baby suffered and/ or died 
2. Doesn't need to take the steps to create a culture where people actually care for the children they created, because it's easier to blame it on not getting enough abortions

The child:
1. Wouldn't have to die in a hot car
2. Wouldn't get to live for a (seemingly) good year 

My biggest issue with the post is that the person doesn't actually know who want's their child and who doesn't. This mother could have very well wanted her baby when she was pregnant and just been a terrible mother. But instead of focusing on this baby who was already born, and discussing ways to prevent this in the future, they shut down that dialogue by bringing up abortion as a solution. But how would that have helped this baby and saved her life? How will it help the next baby? And isn't the importance of her life diminished if they feel the need to bring up how this all could have been avoided had she not been born?

Pardon my jumbled thoughts. I have strong feelings about that post. I wan't to know if other pro-lifers see this often and how you discuss it. Do you feel like people are beginning to belittle the worth of (usually other peoples) children in general?",1501332983,19,2017-07-29 08:56:23

It's the best ""abortion is murder"" argument that I've seen, but I have some problems with it that I think pro-choicers would point out. I'm hoping someone can adress them: 

1) The law he's citing only applies to unborn children ""in utero"", so pre-implantation abortions wouldn't be deemed murder. Also, someone who kills a women's zygote that has yet to implant technically wouldn't have committed murder either, because that law only applies to Homo sapiens ""in utero"". 

2) He also argues that abortion is murder from a scientific perspective, but I think most pro-choicers consider ""murder"" a solely legal term and would therefore dismiss his scientific reasoning. He could argue that it scientifically ""kills"" a human, but not that it specifically ""murders"" a human from a legal perspective.

Now don't get me wrong - I've been pro-life my whole life, and I'm certainly not doubting my views.

I don't know or understand why abortion has become such a huge problem for me (don't get me wrong, it IS a huge problem.) I wouldn't think about as often as I am now. And as a 20-something male, I don't exactly see this as regular.

315,What would happen if abortion were made illegal?,2,True,"I know abortion is morally wrong. I also know, from having talked over the years, with many, many people who consider themselves ""pro-choice"", that a large percentage - probably most; possibly the great majority - of people who are pro-choice are confused about morality. They don't really understand what life is; they don't understand how and why it's sacred; and so they don't understand how and why the taking of human life - even when it is just a fetus - is wrong.

But I'm not convinced that absolutely  everyone who is ""pro-choice"" is completely confused about morality. I think a lot of people who understand that abortion is immoral none-the-less believe that in a multi-cultural, pluralistic, secular, liberal democracy like the one we live in (the United States) it's not possible to force people who don't understand morality to live by it, all the time. I think a lot of the people who are pro-choice are just ""liberal"".

And I don't think liberalism is (necessarily) bad. I consider myself pretty liberal, on a number of issues. When it comes to social issues, I'm quite conservative...but politically, I'm rather liberal on a number of issues. (I think single payer government run health care systems are much better than ""free market"" health care systems.) Religiously, I am much more conservative than the vast majority of my liberal friends: I believe the Bible is ""true""... I feel more at home in a Pentacostal church (amongst people who, perhaps, don't believe in evolution) than I do in a woo-woo hyper-liberal congregation (Unitarian, etc) where each and every sermon is about ""equality"" and ""compassion"", but almost never about things like the importance of understanding morality. But unlike a lot of people who have a more ""literal"" interpretation of the Bible, I believe different books of the Bible are meant to be read in different ways. I believe that some of the stories in the Bible are meant to be taken literally. (I believe Jesus was crucified, and he was resurrected...and if you don't believe that, you're not simply not Christian.) But I also believe that some of the stories - especially from the Old Testament - are meant to be read as allegories (like the creation story...or the story of Noah's Ark).  I believe there is great wisdom in all the stories of the Bible, but they each need to be understood in the proper way. (I think some of the wisdom gets lost when parts of the Bible are read differently from how God intends for them to be read.) So religiously, in many ways, I’m also pretty liberal, too.

Anyway… regarding the subject of this post: It is my liberalism that makes it somewhat difficult for me to properly imagine what our society would be like if abortion were made illegal in all 50 states. I don’t think it’s possible. I want Roe v Wade overturned, and am hopeful it might be, one day…and that would certainly lead to individual states passing laws that would essentially outlaw the practice of abortion - but it would still be legal in many places, and I suspect, the rate would increase in those places (because people would travel from states where it was illegal). But what if it was somehow made illegal in all 50 states? What would happen? Undoubtably, abortion would still happen - it would just be illegal. (People abuse drugs even though that’s illegal.) The prospect of thousands of women “dying from coat-hanger abortions” is a big reason why so many people (like myself, in the past) consider themselves “pro-choice”, even while not really being that excited about it (because deep down, they know abortion is wrong). So... I’m wondering how/if it would be possible to both make abortion illegal and, at the same time, protect people who, undoubtably, would seek it out, despite it being illegal. I’m wondering what that would look like.",1499720124,28,2017-07-10 16:55:24

354,Studies Showing that Restricting Abortion Decreases the Rate,24,True,"I've done quite a lot of research into the effects of abortion laws, since the argument that abortion laws/restrictions do nothing to change the incidence of abortion is one of the most popular pro-choice arguments and it tends to be very influential even among some pro-lifers. The ""personally opposed, but"" crowd tend to use it as vindication of their worldview. Guttmcacher/WHO have published many studies in the Lancet journal finding that abortion rates are the same in countries where it's legal vs. illegal, so pro-choice groups and the media use this to assert that ""science"" has proven that abortion restrictions have no effect. Therefore, even some pro-lifers are led to believe that restrictions are at best pointless and at worst do more harm than good.

Now personally I think a lot of the illegal abortion estimates that Guttmacher/WHO put forward are too high to the point of implausibility. I do believe there are high numbers of illegal abortions in many developing countries, but AGI estimates that literally *every* region where abortion is largely illegal aborts at a rate similar to or higher than Russia, a country with one of the highest documented abortion rates in the world and where a significant portion of women still use abortion as a form of birth control. 

I recently made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/6ezekw/effects_of_abortion_legalization_on_developing/) citing some studies from developing countries showing changes in fertility as a result of abortion legalization, and I thought I'd add to those studies by posting a list of the best studies I've found showing that restrictive laws do have an effect on abortion numbers (I'll just summarize the abstract next to the link) for anyone who's interested to see research on this topic. Note that I've deliberately left out studies done by pro-life organizations.

Note that many of these studies find effects of abortion laws on fertility (lower when abortion legalized and higher when abortion is restricted) which means that it can't be argued that unreported illegal abortion can make up the difference in abortion rates. If abortion restrictions don't change the rate of abortion, then abortion laws shouldn't have any measurable effect on fertility. I think there are enough studies here to pretty much refute the notion that abortion laws don't work. Ironically some of these studies were done by Guttmacher, which is the most common source for that claim. ",1498759325,10,2017-06-29 14:02:05

377,Crisis pregnancy resources in the USA & Canada???,11,True,"Pro-choice seems to very frequently demonize any CPA's on the basis that every single one spews misinformation and intimidates & condemns/guilts women into not going for abortions, and they don't really provide any actual medical services. I know that that is true to an extent, I've seen lots of examples of pretty 'radical' ones that set-up to pose as abortion clinics only to bring vulnerable women in and lie and shame them into submissiveness. It's terrible, and should be stopped. But I'm also sure that they aren't the majority.




There has to be a substantial amount of pregnancy centres that are doing GOOD work. Donating supplies to pregnant women, giving them discounted or free medical help, pre-natals, appointments, etc. All without providing abortions and lying to the women.
Whenever the abortion debate pops up everyone I'm arguing with always points to Planned Parenthood being ""so great"" because they provide medical care beyond abortions, and CPA's are terrible fundamentalist traps.




What I'm looking for is any list or resource of MANY places that vulnerable and in-trouble women can go to get help should they be pregnant. Abused, teenagers, single, assaulted, financially incapable, anything like that. Safe places women can go when they need help with their pregnancy, and more importantly - beyond that. Preferably ones that serve the USA & Canada.




I plan to save them and bring them out whenever the discussion happens.

393,Thoughts on Pro-choice Responses to Responsibility,16,True,"Bodily autonomy pro-choicers have provided some responses to the responsibility objection. My purpose is to expose those responses as unsatisfactory.

When I say the mother is responsible for the condition of her fetus I mean that she owes (has a duty to provide for) her child the required care. If she does not do this, and this results in the death of the child, then she has committed a great wrong.

The bodily autonomy pro-choicer response is to deny that she is responsible. In other words, they reject the claim that she owes her child the required care. They maintain that, although she is causally responsible for the condition of the child, she is not morally responsible.

I will argue they are mistaken.

First, consider that you developed a serum that makes someone depend on your body such that they will have to be in a situation where they depend on your body for a while like in the violinist situation. You lace someone's food with this serum.

Bodily autonomy pro-choicers have objected that although you would be responsible and would owe care, you only owe care because you owe compensation. In other words, your causal responsibility is sufficient for moral responsibility because you make that person you fed the serum to be worse off. But, the pro-choicer argues, the mother does not make the child worse off by partaking in the procreative act. Therefore, the causal responsibility for the dependence is not morally analogous.

Here is what I have to say about that. Suppose that the serum is also therapeutic. Suppose that the person you fed the serum to had an illness that would have killed him in 9 months. You provide the serum and now his illness is cured but he will depend on you to provide care for 9 months in a similar situation to the violinist scenario. You provide the serum, cure his illness, but refuse to provide the care. You did not make him worse off but your act of feeding him the serum converts his death into something you are now the sole arbiter of. There is something depraved about that. You made his death something you can now dictate. You turned yourself into his disease which kills him.

David Boonin gives a similar thought experiment. He supposes that a doctor that cures an illness of a man is therefore obligated to provide kidney support even though it is a side-effect of the therapy. He thinks this is counter-intuitive. I want to agree with Boonin. That might seem strange since my modified thought experiment seems to have committed me to saying that the doctor in Boonin's thought experiment incurs a duty to provide that kidney care. However, there is a very subtle difference between my case and Boonin's case. One difference is that in Boonin's case the therapy does not make the patient need care from specifically that doctor. That is important but not something I want to explore here. I want to talk about the fact that what the doctor did was something, morally speaking, he could not have done otherwise. The doctor had a duty to the extend the life of his patient. It seems plausible that because he could not have, morally speaking, done otherwise, he therefore does not incur a duty to provide the care for the side effect. However, there is no such duty present in the case of the reproductive act. There is no shielding ""couldn't morally do otherwise"" principle that obliges one to participate in the reproductive act. So for this reason I think Boonin's response fails and my analogy is more apt.

There is something sinister about shifting causal responsibility from his disease to your hands and then refusing to provide that care. And there is no analogous ""couldn't morally do otherwise"" principle which makes that seem any less sinister.

I want to take all of this into account and put forward a challenge to the violinist thought experiment which appeals to responsibility intuitions. I think that many pro-choicers will find this thought experiment difficult to respond to.

It goes like this:

Consider a potential mother knows there is a 100% chance her child will have a disorder such that the child will require at the age of 3 years old to be put in a situation similar to the violinist. The child will depend only on the mother. Despite this, she decides to become pregnant and take the baby to term. When the time comes and the child is 3 years old, she decides that she does not want to provide the necessary care. Suppose further that she takes medication that has perhaps even a 90% chance of turning out a healthy child without the condition. So she took all the precautions she could have.

The challenge is that if she is not responsible to gestate, then she is not responsible to provide her 3 year old care. But it seems like she is required to provide her 3 year old that care. If she is required to provide her 3 year old that care, then she is required to provide the fetus that care. And the reason is because she is responsible for that condition.

The pro-choicer might try to employ the ""no worse off"" response to show that she is not responsible for the fetus. But if she does that then the 3 year old is no worse off due to her actions either and therefore she can let her 3 year old die and there is something morally wrong about taking someone's life into your own hands like that regardless of whether the act that caused you to do that made them no worse off.

The no worse off response is just plain counter-intuitive anyway. Think about a woman that brings about, purposefully, a child with withered limbs by taking thalidomide. She did not make the child worse off by taking thalidomide because you cannot compare the condition of the child as it is to brute non-existence. But clearly she owes her child care for causing it to have withered limbs!

I think this line of argument shows that the bodily autonomy pro-choice response to the responsibility objection fails because it seems that causal responsibility is sufficient for moral responsibility for properly similar situations. And this shouldn't be surprising because causal responsibility being sufficient for moral responsibility grounds the legal requirement for father's to provide financial support to their children.",1498153352,34,2017-06-22 13:42:32

The law appears to have contributed to lower fertility in Mexico City compared to other metropolitan areas and prior trends.""

Much of the rationale that pro-choice groups use in their advocacy for worldwide abortion legalization is that it won't actually change the number of abortions occurring, it will only replace unsafe abortions with safe ones. For example, Guttmacher claims that the abortion rate in South America is 48 per 1,000, which is higher than their estimate for Eastern Europe (42), a region with a history of using abortion as birth control. (AGI also claims that the abortion rate in Latin America has increased since 1990, even as the use of modern birth control has also increased in the region. But they credit the decline of abortions in Eastern Europe to better birth control use. So that's kind of interesting). But given that births are directly affected by abortion liberalization, that would mean that the anti-abortion laws of those countries were indeed preventing some abortions. This is pretty much in line with research from the US which shows changes in fertility as a result of legalization and proximity to a clinic as a large factor determining whether a woman will get an abortion.

Pro-choicer here, so obviously we disagree on a lot of things, but I'm just here to delve a little bit more into the pro-life worldview. I'm not here to stoke any fires and am just curious to see this elaborated on.

I am quite sure most pro-lifers believe that rape should be an exception to abortion. Off the top of my head I cannot recall anyone ever *explicitly* state that rape shouldn't be an exception.

But the question I've always wanted to ask these people (hence this post): *how would you prove this*? How do you handle a person who claims to have been raped wanting an abortion? What if she is lying because she eagerly wants an abortion, what if she is truthing and disbelieved, the criminal justice system is backed up and corrupted (it takes time and pregnancy doesn't).

It's something I've always wanted to ask you guys who are against abortion but support rape as an exception. How does supporting rape as an exception work?

What if a woman claims she was raped when she really just had consensual sex? What is the burden of proof?

EDIT: Apparently, I'm mistaken; ""rape shouldn't be an exception"" apparently *is* a common opinion, so I learned something today. I appreciate the replies, thanks everyone.",1496399806,63,2017-06-02 06:36:46
484,The problem I have with the bodily autonomy argument,9,True,"Now when I make my argument in this case remember I am making it about the moral evil of abortion not its legality or illegality. 

People say, well you wouldn't be forced to give blood to a dying person to save their life. But if a close family member was dying and no other blood was able to save them, only yours and you callously said to the rest of the family ""no they can't have my blood it's my body I can do what I want with it"" while your relative slipped away into the goodnight I would think it would be pretty acceptable for them to find you absolutely abhorrent for that behaviour. Maybe not to the point of physically forcing you but definitely to the point of shaming and shunning you (which is a kind of social pressure aimed at forcing). 

And that's a situation where you had no say over the illness that led to the dilemma. Whereas if you are pregnant, excepting cases of rape, you are ending a life you willingly (if not knowingly) created. Which makes it significantly worse than the abhorrence of the previous scenario.

I was thinking about this because I know conservative states have lesser abortion rates (in general) than liberal states. I was thinking about how conservative lifestyles and policies contribute to less abortion, but the numbers may be skewed regarding abortion rate by state.

283,Follow-up Q from a Pro-lifer regarding forced organ donation,8,True,"Hey guys, I'm a mod here. I'm sure most have seen me around. 

Someone recently made a thread (just self-deleted it) asking about forced organ donation -- like generally how people feel about it. 

I have a question for those who see a significant moral difference between ""killing"" vs ""letting die."" Some people said the reason abortion is different than people dying without organ donations is the former is active killing while the latter is letting someone die. Therefore the former is morally wrong and the latter is not.

If you are of this belief, then what do you think of the Violinist-type scenario? Basically in this scenario, a third party (let's say Jim) kidnaps a donor (Beth) and hooks Beth up to a needy person (Randy) so that Randy won't die because he needs something in Beth's blood to survive. Beth has never met Randy before, she's not responsible for his needy condition. Do you believe that Beth unhooking is ""killing"" Randy since it's an active action? Or would you say this is ""letting die""?

Keep in mind, there are multiple types of abortion procedures. Some actively dismember or burn the embryo or fetus. Others use hormones (Mifepristone -- a progesterone antagonist) to cause detachment of the embryo. The analogy above would be more like a hormonal abortion.

This question is strictly to address the ""killing"" vs ""letting die"" objections, not ones about ""nature of the uterus"" and whatnot.

I can acknowledge the discrepancy in comparing a zygote to a single called sex organism like a sperm or egg).

However, I do have some questions I've always wanted to discuss with someone of opposing opinion.  I'm not trying to prove a point, or strike down differing beliefs- this is to understand the nuances of both sides, and I haven't seen much discussion around these questions, personally. 

I really just want to have an open-minded discussion about how either side integrates their beliefs with cultural behavior, and how exceptions (if any) are viewed and how they could best be handled.  Questions below! (No hard feelings if this violates community rules)

1- if you want to share/feel comfortable, I'd love to hear your overall beliefs & why you formed them!

2- I recently read a Facebook comment that cited sources making the case for human life qualified by a unique set of chromosomes/DNA, which makes sense to me. But when we talk about pro-life legislation, does that include protection for parasitic twins or ectopic pregnancies? Technically these each fit the guidelines for human life, but survive at the expense of another human life. Are these included in the lives protected by pro-life advocates? If not, why are they excepted?

3- what does birth mean to you?

4- if life begins at conception, why do we celebrate birthdays and not ""conception days""- or anything similar? Why does our lifespan begin on the day our mothers give birth to us, and doesn't include the ~9 months in utero?

5- as a follow up to question 4- and to bring religion into the discussion- if Christmas is supposed to symbolize Jesus' birth (I think most people know 12/25 is not his actual DOB), and Christianity recognizes life beginning at conception, why don't we celebrate the day of immaculate conception? Or the day the angel told the Virgin Mary she was carrying the son of God? Why do we emphasize the manger and the wise men and not the point in time when Jesus was actually conceived?

345,Thoughts on the Future-Like-Ours Theory,3,True,"I’d like to start by saying hello to the reddit pro-life community. I am unashamedly pro-life, and as a long-time participant in the abortion debate, I look forward to engaging the pro-life and pro-choice redditors in thoughtful discussion, both here and in the pro-choice subreddit.

I stumbled upon this community a while back, and one resource here that caught my interest was Don Marquis’s future-like-ours theory on the wrongness of abortion. And while I don’t think I can write an equally analytical and thorough rebuttal, I’d like to share an informal critique for all who care to read.

My initial impression of the work was generally positive. I appreciate that Marquis’s moral argument was indifferent to religion. I believe he adequately demonstrated that the active desire to live, or the act of presently cherishing ones life, are both irrelevant to the immorality of being killed by another human being. And I think that much of the world considers murder wrong precisely for the reason he mentions. That is to say, when people mourn a premature death—be it friends, family, or strangers—they consider the victim’s lost future a tragedy. It makes sense, then, that Marquis argues from an almost universally accepted premise: that intentionally depriving someone of their future is inherently wrong.

With that said, I find a few problems with this theory. Marquis does not specify how or why having a future like ours carries moral significance, nor to what degree an individual’s future must resemble our own for their killing to be wrong. What about the futures of non-human mammals? Do chimpanzees, for instance, have a future worth protecting? Is it wrong to kill them? Marquis equivocates and suggests yes, but for different reasons. I believe this omission is a fundamental weakness in Marquis’s moral framework. His inability to draw a line and morally differentiate humans and animals places his entire premise into question. And without agreement on his premise, Marquis’s theory is unpersuasive.

This theory also raises questions regarding human individuals without the capacity to value the goods of their future. If it could be proven that a mentally handicapped man would never have a future like ours, would never acquire the sentience to appreciate his own present or future, would it be wrong for a stranger to kill him? If the man’s life is effectively equivalent to that of an animal’s—one which is not deserving of the protection of its life—then is he deprived of his future when killed? Was he wronged any more than a cow is wronged for being slaughtered and consumed?

But above all else, I believe Marquis goes too far to assert that this stolen future is the primary facet that makes murder immoral. By doing so, he undermines the nature of the act and instead emphasizes the intent and consequences. The same intent that can be wielded morally, and the same consequences that can and do arise from moral actions or from happenstance.

Consider the act of attempted murder: is it immoral to kill the assailant in self-defense or in defense of others? I and most others would argue no. But the outcome to the dead aggressor is the loss of his future. If the aggressor is not stopped, then the victim loses *his* life and future. The consequences are equal no matter which party in the conflict is killed. If we accept Marquis’s theory without any ad hoc amendments, then there is no just means to kill someone against their will. Such a conclusion is absurd.

Next, consider non-lethal violence, such as torture. And for the sake of argument, let’s assume the victim is innocent. Here the victim does not necessarily lose his life. Yet murder and torture are both obviously immoral. Are they wrong for different reasons? Is murder wrong for the life lost, and torture wrong for the pain inflicted? This is what I meant when I said Marquis undermines the nature of the act. In principle, both torture and murder are extreme degrees of violence against a fellow human. In my view, their consequences are not, cannot be the basis for their immorality.

A person who dies from starvation, sickness, or natural disasters has not suffered any wrongdoing, even though he too has lost his future. Death is universal and amoral. The intentional killing of an innocent human being, however, is different. In the end, I believe that Marquis fails to explain why. 

So with all that said, I wanted to ask the opinions of those here regarding the future-like-ours theory. Would you consider it a practical and effective pro-life argument? Do you see weaknesses that deter you from supporting such an argument? Do you find it logically or morally sound? Or do you take a middle road and believe that it can be useful as a complement to other pro-life reasoning?

Thank you for reading. I look forward to your replies.",1494567002,1,2017-05-12 01:30:02

360,An Argument for the Moral Permissibility of Abortion Through Libertarian Ethics,1,True,"I'm not here for advocacy, I'm just here to discuss/debate an argument with some of the pro-life community. Can you adequately rebut this argument?

Sally owns a house. But one day, another being comes into her house without her permission. This being is human. Sally takes a gun from her safe, and then shoots the human. The human dies. Did Sally commit murder? No. Did Sally commit an immoral act? Now why would it be different for abortion? 

In a typical case of abortion, a woman has consensual sex which happens to produce an unborn human. However, what many people get wrong, is that in such a circumstance, it is only necessarily true, that the woman chose to have sex, not to have an unborn human inside her. This distinction needs to be clear to everyone who debates the issue of abortion. If a criminal steals a pencil, which eventually leads him to be in jail, does that mean he chose to be in jail? No, of course not. 

Even if I were to put into my original analogy, the fact that the woman did something that (partially) caused the human to exist inside her home, the moral permissibility of her action would be clear. For example: Sally owns a house. But one day, another being comes into her house without her permission. This being is human. Sally takes a gun from her safe, and then shoots the human. The human dies. However, it is revealed that one reason why the trespasser had a presence in her home in the first place, is because Sally chose to kick a rock. In the world that Sally lives in, kicking a rock usually causes a human try to go into a person's house, and Sally knows this. Should Sally be held morally responsible, because she knew what the probable consequences of her actions were? I don't think so. 

Thus, any unwanted human inside a woman is a trespasser, and therefore abortion is morally permissible. ",1494255429,46,2017-05-08 10:57:09

405,[Pro-life short story] the world's fastest horse on the day the car was invented,8,True,"(I wrote this and wasn't sure what to even do with it, so I thought try posting it here.)

The World’s Fastest Horse on the Day the Car was Invented


The year was 1979 and Barney North was well ahead of his time. A brilliant orator, gifted in rhetoric, Barney’s insight was sought on all sorts of issues. He had spoken at great length fourteen years earlier on the turmoil in Alabama, successfully defending the use of fire hoses against protesters. Barney himself agreed that segregation was a problem – he had grown up in as integrated a town as there was in the nation, but keeping the peace was the police department’s job. He did not have to agree with the institutions to object to how some were protesting them.

Being adept at public speaking ran in the North family, at least as far back as Barney’s father, William. Billy North had been a prominent speaker during the Great Depression, railing against the president’s so called “New Deal.” He was not actually against the sprawling public works program, however, he just saw very clearly (and very correctly) that the government lacked the Constitutional justification to enact it.

Of course, they did anyway, but Barney’s father was still right. There was no real power granted to the executive branch to enforce the New Deal. The fact that they found a way to do it somehow was beside the point. People should have listened more to Billy North. His arguments always made sense. Barney modeled himself after his father and, much like him, tried to always make his arguments make sense. Most of all, though, he tried to make sure he won. That was kind of the point of rhetoric after all. Winning.

And the Norths were winners.

Sadly, that was not always the case. Barney’s grandfather, Charles North, was a renowned horse breeder around the turn of the century. He was, in fact, one of the best and his horses were sought by discerning travelers far and wide. Trains had cut into the family business, but he still had a lot of success in the consumer market. People needed to get from place to place quickly and Charles North bred the fastest horses around.

That was no idle brag, either. Seven times in ten years, North Ranch won Fastest Horse in the World, an award given by a confederation of horse breeders and horse enthusiasts. And as the end of the 1800s came about, the competition was falling farther and farther behind. Charles North kept finding better ways to breed and raise horses.

It was even said that he had a plan for breeding a horse so large it could pull as much as most trains and another horse so fast it could get an entire family from Philadelphia to New York in six hours. His work was truly a work of modern science.

And then Henry Ford introduced the Model-T. Charles was crestfallen. His son Billy encouraged him to keep trying, but he took one look at the automobile and decided he could never outsmart it. Just like that, the greatest horse breeder in the world gave up the game. He sold his horses. He bought a car and moved to the city. Billy never forgot the shame of being outsmarted. He taught Barney never to forget it either. His grandfather couldn’t evolve. He would not make that mistake.

Barney learned rhetoric from his father and became a favorite of debate circuits across the country. His most recent issue was a hot button topic for many women around the country who were really beginning to flex their rhetorical muscle. Barney was happy to get in on it at the ground floor before the entire issue blew up. It involved a medical procedure that had existed for some time but which was banned in many places. It went by a number of names, but the current vogue term was abortion.

On the particular day in question, Barney was set to debate Dr. Ivan Dowd, an internist who had recently began to focus on the issue of abortion. He was against the practice, suggesting that human gestation should not be halted under any circumstances. Dowd had his reasons. North had his own arguments against the opinion.

The debate took place in front of a split crowd.

“Dr. Dowd,” Barney began, when the moderator called for the debate to begin, “I have no doubt that you think you are correct and that your intentions are good, but I’m afraid your reasoning is very flawed. We must look at the scientific evidence. Until at least five months, a fetus cannot even move. It has no life.

“If we try to assign rights to every little piece of tissue where do we stop? Does my liver have rights, doctor?”

Now, at the time, this argument generally rattled others at least a little bit. Today, however, Dr. Dowd looked unaffected. Rather than make a remark, he stepped off the stage and wheeled forward a projector. Setting it in front of a screen, he began to play a movie reel. Returning to his podium, he asked a simple question.

“Have you heard of Ultrasound, Mr. North?”

“I’ve seen it used to remove tumors,” Barney replied. “I suppose it could be used for abortion procedures as well, then, eh? It’s more or less the same process.”

As Barney finished, a figure unlike a newborn appeared on the screen. Though it was fuzzy, it was fairly simple to make out.

“This is an ultrasound of a three month old fetus in the womb. How does it look?”

Barney frowned.

“Like a blob?” he said, to the enjoyment of his now cheering supporters.

“You’ll notice the blob has a heartbeat, Mr. North. Does your liver have one of those? Perhaps we can bring an ultrasound machine in and see if your argument holds any weight whatsoever.”

This time it was the other side’s turn to cheer. As Barney looked at the crowd, he saw many of the people who had moments ago supported him looking concerned. He fumbled for something to say as Dr. Dowd continued.

“Here in front of you is a moving image of the human person in the womb. Liver it is not. Tumor it is not. Bundle of tissue it is not…”

“Person it is not!” Barney suddenly cut in. Dr. Dowd was taken aback.

“I’m sorry, what?” Dr. Dowd replied.

“That’s human, of course. No one here is saying it isn’t something human, but it isn’t a person.”

Dr. Dowd looked baffled and Barney could tell the crowd was confused as well.

“How is there a difference?” Dowd asked.

“How is there not?” Barney shot back. “Look around you, doctor. We are surrounded by people. They are sitting, talking, listening and will go on to do many more things. Can the image on the screen behind you do all those things?”

“I…no, but neither…”

“So how can you call it a person like the rest of us?”

“When did humanity and personhood become something separate?” Dowd asked. “I find this line of argument very perplexing.”

“Dr. Dowd, humanity and personhood have always been separate,” Barney replied. “I’m surprised you didn’t know that. How else can we tell the difference between that which is already sentient and that which is not yet? You can’t tell me that thing on the screen has complex brainwaves like you and I. It’s not nearly developed enough to perceive anything!”

Dr. Dowd was at a loss. Barney knew he had him now. What’s more, he was beginning to gain back at least his half of the crowd. In fact, he could see some on the anti-abortion side beginning to question their opinions.

“I…I have literally never heard that argument made before today,” Dowd stammered.

“Well get used to it, doctor, because it’s a fact. We cannot change the fact that this…whatever one might call it at this point, does not perceive the world around it, does not think or dream, and does not qualify as a person. Perhaps, on the far off chance that it could do all these things that we as persons do, one might be able to make some feeble argument for fetal personhood, but it is so unlikely to be true that it seems the stuff of fantasy rather than science. Surely a doctor like yourself would not base his beliefs on fantasy!”

Many in the crowd began to laugh as Dr. Dowd turned red.

“It is not fantasy! We couldn’t measure the things you listed if we wanted to. The technology simply isn’t there. But if you look at what we do know…”

“Dr. Dowd,” Barney replied, rolling his eyes at the word ‘doctor’, “you talk about proofs you can’t demonstrate to distract from what we do know – what we’ve ALWAYS known, and that is that personhood does not exist until the quickening, when the soul enters the womb and the fetus first begins to kick and tumble. That is a measurable time.”

“Now slow down,” Dr. Dowd said. “With this ultrasound technology we can see the child move much soon-”

“How do we even know this technology works?” Barney cut in. “Or that what we’re seeing is really what you say it is. You have everything to gain from lying to us.”

“Excuse me? I’m a doctor!”

Barney shook his head.

“Oh yes, I’m sure you are…”

Dr. Dowd was left mouth agape as the crowd cheered for Barney. He gave them a kind wave and looked back at the still moving ultrasound.

*Not this time, Model-T. You won’t take my livelihood.*

As he walked off the stage in triumph, Barney smirked and shook his head.

I always though that pro lifers are the biggest hypocrites because they are advocates for war and suffering. They use religion in politics and that angers me because they should be separate and it violates freedom of speech to those that are not religious. It also supports bigotry.

I am no liberal either. Come to think of it, I think in this subject regarding abortion, only the woman should decide because her decision does not affect us. We also tend to forget how painful it is women have to go through when giving birth and denying so is proof you are no better than those misogynists at r/incel.

Despite my dislike towards pro lifers, I am open for you to change my view. As an atheist antinatalist, why should I be happy being born? If anything, I feel guilty because my  mom had me at 17 and not once have I seen my parents together. My life is a mistake to begin with and I prefer never being born at all. With all this said, I would never encourage my beliefs towards anyone in abortion because ultimately, I support freedom and restricting what a woman should do to her body is wrong and bringing a child into this planet is wrong as the entire process is random and you are never given a chance to make a decision.

For safety reasons, I do not feel comfortable saying the exact school name or location, but the school is a private law school in Ohio located in a large city. I have considered seeing if maybe after my first semester, if I can garner interest and after I get to know some people (I don't know anyone yet as I haven't had any orientation events or anything as of yet), possibly start a pro life group. I am very passionate about the pro life cause and there are groups on this campus that are conservative, such as a Republicans group. But with this in mind, I want to know what to consider with this. I have never started a club before, and don't know much about it. Also, I find it a little intimidating to start a group that represents a very loaded political issue, because I'm not sure how welcoming this school is to conservative viewpoints. Because it is a small school, I am worried about what this could mean for the rest of my academic career at this institution. But I feel very passionate about this issue and feel having these viewpoints heard is beneficial to the cause and potentially to the students. 

With all of this in mind, could you share your thoughts on all of this? How do I gauge how much student interest there is and what not without upsetting the wrong person?

469,Point of order - let's be the adults,4,True,"This is something that has been weighing on my mind. I'd like to remind everyone on this sub that the down-vote button is *not* a ""I disagree"" button.

According to the rules of this sub, pro-choice comments are allowed, ""...as long as the pro-choicer demonstrates that they are open-minded. Pro-choicers simply here for advocacy or trolling are unwelcome and may be banned."" I would submit to you that a pro-choice person expressing pro-choice opinions in a back-and-forth debate is appropriate, and should not be down-voted. Simply up-vote the pro-life sentiments that you agree with and leave the others alone.

I'm active a little bit, where I think it might be constructive, on the pro-choice subreddit. There are some reasonable people, but there are some extremely hateful, close-minded, and unreasonable people there. The general character of the sub can be seen with the high amount of down-votes pro-life comments receive, even if they follow the rules.

That being said, we can be better than that. Please, look at my comment history. I am extremely pro-life, and want to do anything possible to save the lives of the unborn. A big part of that is welcoming discussion from the other side. We can't change minds if we don't have a *genuine* and good-intentioned conversation with those who disagree with us, and the odds of us having that conversation are greatly reduced if anyone who comes on here with a pro-choice opinion is immediately down-voted. Also, another *crucial* part is influencing the undecided. If someone who is unsure on the issue browses the pro-choice subreddit, they will see the hate, vitriol, toxicity, and lack of reason. What will they see when they look at this subreddit?

Please, food for thought. It is *good* when we have the chance to talk to someone who thinks differently. Don't chase away dialogue.

476,A prochoice males conversation with my prolife mother.,5,True,"A few months ago I decided to talk to my mom about abortion which can be dicey as she is a devout Christian, who truly walks the walk and I'm a strong left leaning agnostic. To my suprise, I found we agreed on most everything except for where life begins.. and in my opinion where life begins has nothing to do with preventing abortions. I was saying that we need to educate more, and the right wingers who want abstinence only education are the problem. She said we need to educate more about the dangers of abortions and what the process really is. She said that it wasn't allowed to be taught in schools  (which I never followed up on, and don't know if it's true or not). Consesus: more comprehensive sex education. The next topic I brought up, which I thought she would be totally against was accessible and affordable birth control.  Again, we were in total agreement. 

Determining where life begins is such a sensitive topic, and IMO people like her and I will never find common ground. All talking about it does is make us resent eachother, so I say next time you want to talk about how to prevent abortions, leave out the parts that we will never agree on and focus on topics that will move us in the right direction, instead of perpetual bickering.",1492116712,178,2017-04-13 16:51:52

228,Those who advocate birth control as a solution to abortion are missing the point.,45,True,"We really need to set something straight here. Birth control, whether it be by contraceptives, condoms, or abstinence, is not a preventative measure for abortion.  Those means are preventative measures for _pregnancy_.  I see people saying ""Well there you go, fewer pregnancies, fewer abortions! The studies prove it!""  But you're not really understanding something here; my goal is not fewer pregnancies. Why would I care about that? Pregnancy is a good thing. Human life is a good thing. If every family out there decided to have ten kids each, I wouldn't see anything wrong with that. My only goal is that we stop thinking that killing children is okay, not that we prevent their conception altogether. 

I'm not saying I have a problem with people using the birth control methods available to them, because for the most part I don't. But I think all this talk about preventing pregnancies is a distraction. I'm not out to prevent pregnancies, I'm out to persuade people away from thinking it's okay to kill kids.  Obviously, if *no one ever got pregnant*, the abortion rate would drop to zero, but that would not be because we had all realized it was bad to kill children.

266,An approach to abortion I've been thinking about lately,6,True,"So I have spent time in both prolife and prochoice camps through the years, but lately with more thought on the subject, I've come to settle firmly with the prolife side.  Here's my rationale:

If we begin by conceding the following and taking as axiom:

-The ultimate goal of a position/legislation here is to preserve the dignity of life - both in the case of the mother and the fetus/baby.

-While people on both sides may take definitive stances on this, let's say that we don't know certainly whether the fetus is life or not.

Okay, with these two ideas in mind, let's consider a situation where a newly pregnant woman is considering an abortion. For the state to intervene and tell the woman how to act, it would have to be more certain than not that the termination would do more harm to the dignity of life than the alternative- making it a moral evil.  

The problem I see here is that it is not a matter of fetus vs woman, as so many on the pro choice side of things believe - but rather 1% of the bodily autonomy of a woman vs 100% of whatever life a fetus has. This is because forcing a woman to carry to birth takes 9 months or about 1% of her lifespan.

With these things in mind, I'm convinced that to deem the abortion morally okay, I would need to be at least 100x more certain than not that the fetus is not life.  Even if in my mind, there's only a 10% chance that this fetus is anything but a bundle of cells and I don't prevent an abortion, I still picked the alternative that is 10x worse in terms of preserving life.

So I guess what I'm saying is that it's important to take a step back and examine the scale of the situation.  You have to be absolutely certain (>99% sure) that the fetus is not alive for abortion to make any sense at all - and I think realistically, how many of us can claim such certainty in any area, especially one which is so contentious?

376,Honest Questions About Pro-Life Law Enforcement,7,True,"Hey. I'm new to your sub, but I have honest questions about how a pro-life society might work. I was hoping that you could help me out with that.

I don't want this to turn into a debate on morality. I don't want to turn this into a debate on whether abortions should be legal or illegal. I just want to hear perspectives about how the world would work in that scenario. I won't even respond to you unless you explicitly say so (making sure that we don't turn it into a debate of some sorts). I honestly want to hear your perspective.

So, let's say that the scenario is that abortions are now illegal, except rape, incest, and serious danger to the life of the mother (three exceptions generally given today even by a lot of conservatives). How would law enforcement for this work? How would law enforcement handle this?

For example, how does law enforcement know if a women might have a baby in her womb (and thus could have an abortion)? Would women need to report their menstrual cycles?

If there were rape, does the mother need to get a conviction prior to abortion? If the abortion is granted up front, what happens if there's insufficient evidence to bring a conviction? Is the mother guilty of murder?

What happens if a mother miscarries under questionable circumstances? Is a criminal case held against her?
What do the law enforcement aspects of a ""pro-life"" society look like?

Would law enforcement be able to obtain a warrant to examine the state of a woman's reproductive system? What exactly would constitute probable cause?

I've never heard any good answers to these questions from people seeking to make abortions illegal. I'd be interested in hearing what this world would look like.

Any solutions to these questions inevitably seems to treat women as second-class citizens and deprives them of right to privacy and liberty that we've grown to enjoy in our society.

453,"Had the U.S. Supreme Court imposed a limit of 12 weeks rather than viability for the right to abortion, do you think that the abortion issue would have been much less controversial in the U.S.?",4,True,"Basically, this one pro-lifer has told me (on another website) that she believes that the reason that abortion is such a heated issue in the U.S. is because the U.S.'s abortion laws are extreme in comparison to most European countries. Specifically, she told me that if the U.S.'s abortion laws were more similar to Europe's abortion laws--at least in regards to the approximate 12 week limit for elective abortions--the abortion issue would be *much* less controversial here in the U.S. because, in her opinion, people have much more sympathy for older fetuses than for embryos and younger fetuses.

481,Who do I blame,9,True,"I'm confused about the whole idea of abortion and the debate around it. 
A year ago right now my wife and I found out that she had a genetically inherited disease and an autoimmune disease. We were 11 weeks pregnant. One of the concerns were that A she couldn't carry to term, her body couldn't physically support the weight. B that if she made it to term labor could cause her heart to rupture and she'd bleed out before anything could be done. In situation A sometime in the second trimester her cervix would fail(no option to stitch it closed) and our baby would slide out. Situation B meant she'd would make it to term but when labor started she would die but baby would survive most likely. 

So here we faced a choice of potential devastating loss when grocery shopping or I get to be a single father. We had the talk several times about abortion. It's difficult to have a conversation about choosing my wife or my unborn when one is called murder and the other life saving. Why would it be ok to abort to save my wife? Wouldn't it be murder/suicide for us to proceed? Additionally there is a risk that the baby would have what she has and be faced with the same situation later in life. Why would one choice be morally superior to the other? What would you choose? I understand the this is a unique situation and definitely non typical but everything I could read on the pro choice side told me that I was facing a choice to terminate a life. That life starts at conception. That I knew the consequences. That I was going to murder, murder, someone. I assure you I didn't know. Our choice was to try to have a child. Our choice was to raise a child in a loving home which we could provide. Our choice was to love something more than ourselves. Our choice wasn't to face something so horrific as a deciding who survives this. 

Situation A gave us a scare when her cervix started thinning but fortunately stopped and pregnancy continued 

Situation B was still a major threat as we proceeded. I watched as her belly grew and spoke to our son. I would lay in bed and drag my fingers through my wife's hair and watch as she gazed at him moving inside her belly. We laughed as we through out names. I watched as her body changed. I would lay awake a memorize every detail of her face as she slept. I woke up early to make her breakfast. I carried everything and followed her instructions as she began to nest and prepare our home. There is nothing more precious and dear to our experience than witness a woman becoming a mother. 

A c-section wasn't optional due to how her body healed if she would survive it anyways. So we made or plans and prepared. At 11 pm she came and told me her water broke. We followed our plan exactly. She was unable to get an epidural due to degenerative vertebrae. We waited and spoke as labor set it. Two hours in I was speaking to her telling her she could do this when it happened. I watch as her eyes rolled back and chest went still. I watched completely motionless as they pulled my son from my wife's motionless body. When they handed him to me all I could was her face, her nose, her chin, her eyes. The greatest day of my life wasn't vibrant it was pale and grey. I sat holding my son that will never know his mother's smile and embrace. 

You might be asking why did we continue and I assure you I ask myself this every waking moment. It's because she was so convinced that abortion is murder. When we went to the clinic people yelled that we were killing our baby and my wife forced us to leave. Yes, it was her choice. But I will not call it a sacrifice. She was scared . It was fear and reteric that in the end removed her choice. So I'm here, I have a five month old son, my wife is gone. There is compelling arguments on both sides of this debate but there is a resonibility in how we address it. Guilt, shame, and fear robbed my family. We could have gotten an abortion and adopted. I love my son. I loved my wife. Someone please explain why abortion would have been murder. Why isn't it murder to those people who yelled at us that we were killing our baby?

497,Sex-selective Abortion,7,True,"I just finished reading a 2011 book called *Unnatural Selection* by Mara Hvistendahl (which I recommend) addressing the issue of sex-selection abortion (what drives it, how it became so popular in Asia, and its negative effects on a population). 

Typically the pro-choice response to this issue is to argue that since sex-selection (for sons) in Asia and Eastern Europe is driven by patriarchy, that combating sex-selection should focus on elevating the status of women. If you remove the patriarchy, you'll remove sex-selection. However, this would be a very long drawn-out process that would take decades to be successful (if that ever happens) so Hvistendahl (who is pro-choice) recommends a strict regime where doctors in countries with sex selection problems strictly monitor women carrying female fetuses and jail doctors for revealing the sex of the fetus to couples. (It's already illegal for doctors to reveal the sex of the fetus in China and India but the laws usually aren't well enforced). Hvistendahl also mentions that sex-selection is often chosen by women (either the pregnant mother or the mother in law) and is more concentrated among the rich and educated than the poor and ignorant. 

Hvistendahl also in a few parts of the book criticizes the ""right wing"" and anti-abortion activists for using sex-selective abortion as a tool to advocate for the abolition of all abortion. However, she also admits in the book ""after decades of fighting for a woman's right to choose the outcome of her own pregnancy, it is difficult to turn around and point out that women are abusing that right.""

Although Hvistendahl defends the pro-choice position while opposing sex-selection (she isn't only against selecting for boys, in the epilogue of the book she expresses concern over couples using IVF pre-implantation technology to select for sex, even though couples using that technology select for girls about 80% of the time) it did get me thinking that it seems rather difficult to oppose sex-selection while accepting pro-choice arguments. The standard pro-choice rhetoric saying that abortion is an intensely personal decision between her and her ""family"" and her ""faith"" is hard to reconcile with opposition to sex selection (since a woman's decision plus her family and faith may be telling her to abort a female fetus). And if you believe abortion needs to be legal for bodily autonomy then there's really no way to oppose sex selection (if a woman doesn't want a female child inside her body, then that would be her right). Now I do think a person could support abortion being allowed in some instances and still be opposed to sex-selection, but I don't think that opposition can be reconciled with the pro-choice argument that abortion rights are near absolute and are ultimately a private decision. 

So I wondered if anyone that is pro-choice has a response to this, or if anyone pro-life believes it's possible to believe the typical pro-choice rhetoric while opposing sex-selection. ",1487295917,2,2017-02-16 20:45:17

If a pregnant woman keeps smoking while pregnant, she will be (potentially) harming a human being/person that cannot resist or get away from this harm.

294,"Lets debate pro-life vs. pro-choice using psychological and Philosophical, non-emotion based, points.",0,True,"**First, I'd like to share my view point. Please read the whole thing to understand where I am coming from**

I would never get an abortion because I do not believe I could do it with a clear conscience. I've been trying to understand it from the side of those who do not feel it is morally wrong, so I took into consideration the vegans argument. I used to argue with vegans that meat is NOT murder, but then one day i thought about it... is this how others see pro-lifers? Vegans truly believe that millions of animals are unjustly murdered each year, and it pains them. I personally cannot see it this way, but it has allowed me to consider that maybe the difference in our beliefs is a result of our own experiences and our unique perspectives on life. What may be wrong to me may be just to someone else and vice versa.
It would not be fair of me to want a law that forces another person to live by the rules of my own belief system. As much as one might believe a fetus should have the right to life...that fetus does NOT believe the same. That fetus cannot contribute to the moral debate of abortion because it does not have morals. It does not have a belief system. It does not think. It is not self aware. The fetus does not care what happens to it because it does not even know it exists.


If you hurt someone you are causing a fully self aware person to suffer. If you kill someone/yourself you are causing those who loved that person to suffer. If you kill someone you are erasing an entire consciousness full of memories and beliefs and dreams from existence.

If you abort a fetus the only thing you are erasing is the opportunity for that fetus to one day have dreams and beliefs and memories of its own. Some believe that it should have that opportunity in all cases and other believe they should decide for themselves what they do with their own body and the life that they create. On that same token, if you decide not to have sex during ovulation you are also preventing that unique egg from the opportunity of becoming at fetus and ultimately a fully conscious, self aware human being. And so naturally, there are people who DO believe that mans purpose is to reproduce and that birth control is wrong. That is their belief and they are entitled to it, but it does not make it a fact, and it certainly does not mean others should be forced to abide by anothers personal beliefs.

**Now I want to talk about 'right vs. wrong' for a bit:**

*""Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so""*

>Then doesn't that mean we can justify murdering another person?

What 'is' and 'isn't' moral is perceptual society decides as a whole what is and is not moral. In many countries domestic violence is considered to be moral. In some countries sexually assaulting a child is considered right. At one point, in our own country, we believed owning a *slave* was moral. However, counties with these rules are generally chaotic and dysfunctional, which is why people living in these countries are desperately trying to escape to our country or other civilized societies where we have equal protection.

Laws are not created to define what is 'right' or whats is 'wrong'. Instead they are implemented to create order in a society. Without order anyone would have the right to kill whomever they want, rape whomever they want, steal or destroy what ever they want, and so on. In order for a society to be functional it needs to implement some basic laws, not only to deter crime, but so that members of that society can feel safe. Technically, everyone has the right to do whatever they want, but we have created rules so that no one has to fear being unjustly harmed in any way, shape, or form. Theft harms another by having their property taken away. Murder harms another by having their life taken away. Assault harms another by having damage caused to their body. We have laws against these things so that no one has to live in fear or pain. Legal abortions do not pose a threat to other members of society. No being in our society is directly threatened through the act of legalizing abortions. No one has to live day to day in fear of being aborted or of having their child forcefully removed from their uterus, and no one should have to live in fear that if for some reason they happen to get pregnant they will be forced to put their own life at risk or on hold so that something that has no awareness, no thoughts, no opinions, and no conscious, can develop into a baby, all because someone else doesn't like the thought of it.

**Consider the Following:**

One man might believe it is ok to hurt another man and steal his food, because he is poor and needs to take care of his family, while the other man would likely believe his actions are not okay because now he may go hungry and his life/body is threatened. The attackers family may be happy with his decision and believe that it is right, because they benefit, but the victims family may believe it to be 'wrong' because they are being threatened.
The reason the attacker feels his actions are right and the victim feels his actions are wrong are due to biological processes. The reason a spectator might side with the victim, rather than the attacker, is because we have evolved to develop empathy. The feelings of 'good' and 'bad' have developed in order to increase our chances of surviving. The ability to justify hurting another man and/or his family to support our own family is also an evolutionary trait designed to promote survival of the fittest. The only way for man to live in a fully functioning civilized society is to create a set of rules that protect people from inflicting perceived harm on another person. You can believe murder is right, but we do not allow it in our civilized society because it threatens ALL members of that society. You can believe homosexuality is wrong, but we **do** allow it in our civilized society because it does not threaten the other members of our society. Do you see how there is a difference? And on a similar note, one might believe murdering a new born baby or viable fetus is a mother's right because it does not threaten the members of society, but we do not allow this, despite the fact that the baby is not yet self aware, because (1) that baby is no longer dependent on the mother, and has been declared a member of society on their birth certificate, and (2) we have established it is not logical nor necessary to kill a baby that poses no physical threat to the mother and that the state will take responsibility for the child if the mother chooses not to.


It's not always easy, but if we can separate ourselves from the idea of 'right' and 'wrong', we can understand our actions and the actions of others much better. As a society, it can help us determine which 'rules' are logical for a society to function and which rules are purely subjective.



If anything I have said comes off as offensive or insensitive, I sincerely apologize and that is not my intent. I am really just looking for a civil discussion.

309,For Your Consideration: A Recent Conversation I had with a 'reluctant' pro-Choicer. Thoughts? Additions? Revisions?,16,True,">1) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to think that all women who find themselves to be pregnant are physically, emotionally, and financially capable of having a child. Also, there seems to be an assumption that pregnant women don't face threats of violence from boy friends, husbands, parents, siblings, or friends when a pregnancy is announced.

None of this is true.  

First of all, your phrase ""find themselves pregnant"" implies they were just walking along one day and BAM, they were suddenly pregnant.  Except in the case of rape, pregnancy springs from an intentional act, and the consequences of that act are always profound. 

Secondly, we know perfectly well that it can be challenging to raise a child.  But there are long lists of parents looking to adopt, and even if there were not, the inconvenience or difficulty of raising a child would not be adequate justification for executing them.

Lastly, I don't know what point you're even trying to make at the end there.  Yes, friends and family sometimes react poorly to an unexpected pregnancy, but that has nothing to do with the question of whether or not it is just to kill an innocent human child.

>2) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to think that a perfect ""God's Gift"" is created at conception. But the fact is that the 23 (or so) chromosomes that the egg contributes, and the 23 (or so) chromosomes that the sperm contributes don't always create a blueprint for a viable human being. Sometimes there's a blueprint for nothing more than a placenta -- no baby at all! Sometimes the blueprint grows something that doesn't have a brain . . . or a heart. There are variables in the blueprints. XXY and XYY men have 47 chromosomes, not the ""standard"" 46, so we know there are variances in what can happen -- sometimes these variances create a fine, viable person, and sometimes they don't.

The abortion debate ONLY concerns living, growing human beings.  If a mutation of some kind results in stillbirth, that has nothing at all to do with this dispute.

>3) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to think that a soul is inserted into the zygote as soon as conception is complete. But if that's the case, then what about the second soul for identical twins? Sometimes the zygote splits soon after conception, while still in the fallopian tube, which results in two (or more) separate implantations in the womb, and sometimes identical siblings don't split from one another until after there's been an implantation in one spot. When it comes to identical siblings, if the soul is delivered at conception, and there are now two (or more) embryos, which one gets the soul. Does the one (those?) who does not get the soul become ""the evil twin""?

You're concerning yourself with something that is fairly immaterial to the pro-life position.  There isn't any broad consensus about the nature and timing of ensoulment between religions, let alone between religious and secular pro-lifers.  What we agree on is the intrinsic value of human life, and that all living, developing, innocent human children have the right to live.

>4) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to want to take ""mother's life is in jeopardy"" decisions out of the hands of women and their doctors and grant these critical decisions to written law, or, perhaps, religious organizations. I believe there are some pro-life people who don't believe an abortion should be performed even if the mother's life is in jeopardy, but for those who do, how do you write a law to cover that? If a woman's blood pressure is 150 / 120, is that too high? 180/130 too high? Diabetes? Heart palpitations? Kidney failure? Bladder cancer? I don't know how laws can be written to handle ""life of the mother"" situations, without granting the absolute right to women and their doctors to determine when those situations exist.

False.  The pro-life position is that in life-threatening situations, such as an ectopic pregnancy, it is sometimes necessary to remove the child from the mother's body, or else both mother and child might die.  This is not considered an abortion, because the aim is not to kill the child, but to save the life of the mother, making it more akin to a miscarriage than anything else.  It's a tragedy when this happens.  The decision to surgically remove a child from his or her mother's body absolutely must be justified stringently, but no pro-lifer would say that it must never happen.

>5) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to have forgotten the back-alley butchers that the poor availed themselves of prior to Roe v. Wade. They also, to me, seem to have forgotten the joke the well-to-do made of abortion restrictions by flying off to Europe to have abortions. ABC, as I recall, ran a special on the flights-to-Europe ways of getting around U.S. abortion restrictions in the early 1970s, and it made our restrictions seem pretty useless.

Butchers like serial killer Kermit Gosnell?  Roe V. Wade did not prevent him from visiting his horrors on mothers and children alike.

In any case, this is a deflection.  It does not address the core of the debate, and that is whether or not it is justifiable to kill an innocent human child because the mother wills it.

>5) The pro-life bunch, to me, seem to want to defer to ""The Will of God,"" instead of turning to the brains God gave them. Does God really want a woman to die (as an Indian dentist did in Ireland) when there is a hopeless pregnancy and the logical (at least to me) remedy for saving the woman's life is to perform an abortion?

(5 twice?) Again, no pro-lifer believes that a pregnancy in which it is impossible to save both mother and child should always be preserved.  If a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, then continuing it would be a threat to both her life and to the child's.  Rather than letting them both die, it may make the most sense to remove the child from his or her place in the Fallopian tube.  Unfortunately, this may indirectly cause the death of the child, but currently we may not be able to avoid that.  We do not consider such situations abortions.

>6) The pro-life bunch, to me, seems to concentrate far more on the unborn than they do on the born. Medicaid and other healthcare funding, along with Child Protective Services, don't seem to be very important to the pro-life bunch.

This is also a deflection.  We are very concerned with the well-being of children at all ages.  We cry out the loudest, however, when people try to justify killing them.  There is no legal or economic consideration that would make intentionally killing an innocent human child acceptable.

>7) The pro-life bunch, to me, doesn't want sex education, other than abstinence, taught in school. I can think of more than a few ""abstinence only"" people who are great at preaching abstinence, but who, oops, seem to have gotten pregnant out of wedlock. Wouldn't preventing pregnancy with birth control that actually works be preferable to unplanned pregnancies.

This is patently untrue.  It's nothing more than an argumentative fallacy, since pro-lifers are by definition concerned with the right to life, not with how one goes about avoiding a pregnancy.  But keep this in mind:  EVERY birth control option has a failure rate, except abstinence.  If you absolutely, positively must avoid being pregnant, the only way to avoid it with 100% success is abstinence.  That much, at least, should be understood.  Many forms of birth control are agreeable to pro-lifers, but abortion is not one of them.  Simple as that.

>I hope, that we're all sickened when a perfectly healthy woman elects to have an abortion, and, equally, we're all sickened when a gravely ill woman who is pregnant with what is obviously a non-viable fetus, dies because an operation to save her life is denied.

I wish that were true.  Unfortunately, I recently saw a pro-choicer make the assertion that he knew abortion was murder, but it should still be legal, because the preferences of the mother ought to supersede those of a human ""parasite.""  That kind of talk makes me sick, and I cannot help but oppose it if I am going to give any heed at all to my conscience.",1485977587,4,2017-02-01 14:33:07

I wanted to defend it so much but I took the high road and apologized for how it made her feel. I ended the conversation with "" I refuse to get into this debate with family members as it causes conflict such as this ""

We were using birth control after that because the doc told us another pregnancy would ether end in an abortion or most likely my wife's death.

354,Is using birth control a form of abortion/immoral?,4,True,"Hi everyone,

It's been a long time since I've posted here--I used to be moderately active in the sub a little over a year ago. To give you an update, I was recently married five months ago in August. I've been taking oral contraception as prescribed by my doctor for the past three months, and when he was explaining how birth control works, he was mentioning that if an egg happened to be fertilized, it wouldn't attach to the uterine wall and would be sloughed (sp?) off with my next cycle. So I caught him on that and said ""You mean I can still conceive while on the pill?"" And he explained that scientifically it isn't considered a pregnancy until the egg attaches to the uterine wall, and also that it's common for people to have fertilized eggs without taking any form of BC and that those may be sloughed off as well, for example if the conception is close to a period. He said it's  considered essentially a ""mini miscarriage--"" and these things are common and happen often on their own, without the influence of BC.

I know some Christians believe that even using birth control is a form of abortion, which of course hurts my heart because it's not my intention or my goal to take life--but if these ""mini-miscarriages"" are inevitable and happen to all women, then does taking oral contraception matter?


I'm just worried because I want to enjoy being married to my husband and without having a baby right away. We're both young and want to wait a few years before taking that step, and I just want to be responsible. I've heard of natural family planning, but it sounds extremely complicated and I feel like it'd only give me anxiety with having the math/science off and cause me to want to avoid being intimate at all.

What I don't hear a lot of talk about is when abortion is used for people who are not irresponsible. In my life, my wife was pregnant in 2015,and we found out 21 weeks in that the baby had a severe genetic defect. Her ribs were all broken, skull was thin, and bones were sticking out. We went to multiple specialists and were unanimously told that there is absolutely no chance of the baby surviving. Worse yet, there was a chance the baby would be born alive, suffer extreme pain for maybe 2 hours and then die horribly. At the same time, giving birth could seriously hurt my wife. 

We were (and still are) devastated, but truly felt the right thing to do was to terminate the pregnancy early. While I still mourn the death of the daughter I never knew, I am glad that I could do the one thing I could as her father and save her a literal life of torment. 

Which brings me to what is probably my obvious question. In cases like this, do you truly believe that families are better off in a country that does not give them this option, and if so, why?

I worry about the ability for us to reach our goal.  I don't think we can repeal roe V wade without a shift in the nation. In the 1852 Uncles Tom's Cabin roughly as Lincoln said "" caused the civil war"". We need something, a movie, a book, maybe a story or something that will become like wild fire. We need to be able to prove to people like uncle tom's cabin that even in the best circumstances a abortion is going to be ultimately killing someone and that is wrong. I think we have a shot with repealing roe v wade with Trump in the next 4 years but only if a shift happens otherwise it will be in constant dispute for the next 100 hundred years.

Additionally, she'll seek child support for 18 years, and the man will pay for what he considers a ""mistake"" for 18 years. Rightfully so.

Frankly, it never works. I'm talking about breaking the law, knowing there's no way this is legal, but also knowing there's a pretty good shot at saving a life.

I'm going to take it as a rule that harming anyone is a no. Period. Because no, and because there are other ways. But where is the line drawn? Is it ethical to break the law (in the US, anyway) and block an abortion clinic driveway if it gives you a better shot at saving a life and healing one or two (dat boyfriend, bruh) more?

Given her history however, my moms doctor wanted to play it safe and put her on bedrest and a monitor for the entire pregnancy. This is where the insurance company initially denied the claim for the monitor since as they claimed I ""was not a viable life"". Thankfully, the doctor being a good man, fought with the insurance company and won. Fast forward a few months and I was born (two months early) but healthy.

 What is the logic behind this? If someone truly believes that abortion is murder, then why does the crime change anything.

My pro-life Catholic friends are agreeing with these lies.

If PP didn't make their big bucks in abortion I wouldn't care about it. They also act as if PP being defunded means women would not get access to any sort of medical care. This, of course, is also BS.

191,Maybe I was wrong about being Pro-life.,7,True,"I think no matter which side of the argument you are on we can all agree that the goal is to *minimise the amount of suffering*. I understand that abortion is killing a human. Which is why abortion is wrong, because killing other humans is wrong, right?

Now call me crazy but we should ask ourselves *why* killing other humans is wrong. If I kill a stranger in the street it is morally wrong because:

 * The person will physically suffer.
 * The person did not want to die, they have the right to life, and I took that away from them.
 * The person had family and friends who *loved* them, they will suffer emotionally with the loss. 

However with a foetus these conditions are not neccersarily true. The foetus will not physically suffer. The foetus did not have a *want* to live. The only people who would've loved the foetus would be the mother or the father who have been granted the *choice* to have an abortion. 

I acknowledge that the third point is rather weak. The father may want to keep the child but the mother could still abort it. 

However let's be honest here, who is the best judge of each situation, the government or the individual? Each individual is far better at judging their own situation to reduce suffering, rather than the government putting a blanket ban on abortion (this is true for many things, the government just sucks at everything).

I don't understand why abortion is perceived to be a terrible thing.

Setting scientific and religious arguments aside, I think it is safe to say that (born) humans fear death because it is an end the continuous journey we have been experiencing since birth. An end to all of the good and bad memories we have had and shared with others. Life is all we know. 

So an unborn baby has no recollection of life. They have no understanding of what they will experience. No memories, no emotions, enjoyment or sadness. All a baby knows is simply existing in a dark room (They actually don't but many people in the pro life community insist they are aware and concious so I will give them the benefit of the doubt)

I was shocked because I attended my sisters ultrasound last year and she was 10 weeks along as well, but the baby was only shown to look like an abstract circle. She was planning on aborting, but I bet if she saw a little baby shaped fetus rolling and kicking around like I did her choice would of changed. I asked my ultrasound tech how this could be possible and she told me something that shocked me.
She said that other techs at clinics that offer abortions have the ability to make the fetus look abstract, like a blob, instead of actually showing the baby's silhouette. I almost didn't believe her but my mind immediately shifted when she demonstrated it infront of me!! My baby went from looking like a mini newborn to looking like two little non-human looking circles! She told me that this kind of trickery is very common and its a tactic used to sell abortions, because it works with the whole ""it's just a lump of cells!"" Argument. This made my heart sink to my belly. If I wasn't prolife I definitely am now.
I was wondering if you guys have any information regarding trickery in ultrasound appointments? I tried googling it but I found absolutely nothing.
I also feel like schools should teach students what a fetus looks like at different weeks so they can't be tricked later on, because this is a true evil if I've ever seen it.

260,Left-Wing Liberal Pro-Lifers,72,True,"So. I suppose most think we do not exist. However, we do. I am one of them.

I am about as liberal as they come. However, I do not simply adopt beliefs because other liberals do. I make my own rational choices according to my own conscience, and intellect.

I am simply wondering how many other liberals out there are also pro-life? I am also curious what your reasons are for being pro-life?

Personally, I am pro-life for ethical, and moral reasons. I find many pro-choicers have a disgusting take on what it means to be a 'person'. Without proof, evidence.. they claim that unborn babies are not human beings.. some even go so far as to call them 'parasites.'. 

When reading things like these, it makes me hesitant to continue calling myself a liberal, however, the rest of my belief system would almost certainly fall under the label of liberal.

I am under the personal belief that abortion should be an absolute last resort. Used only when the mother or baby are in danger of death, or serious life-long injury/disability. As well as In the cases of rape on underaged women (16 and under), however, rape on women over that age could easily be dealt with by using heavy counseling, therapy, and with communal support. With the resulting baby either being kept, or given away for adoption if the experience remains too traumatic for the mother.

The problem right now is that even our medical researchers have agendas, and it's very difficult to find impartial research by which we should make our choices. I believe the moment an unborn baby has developed a nervous system, abortion should no longer be allowed. If we could determine the exact moment a child in the womb begins having 'experiences', such as pain, hunger, or awareness of any type.. abortion should no longer be an option except in rare cases which I have already mentioned (high risk of death, or severe permanent disability of the mother, or child.)

The latest research I have found (I can not attest to its impartial nature), is that children in the womb have a nearly fully developed nervous system at between 12 to 13 weeks. 

I believe a good start would be to expand abortion clinics for the safety of women, while simultaneously reducing the cut-off age at which abortions become illegal. I think between 9 to 11 weeks should be the absolute maximum, at least until further research is done. I believe it is currently 22, with some states allowing it up to 24 weeks.

Right now people seem to be very polarized in their opinions, and much of it is very angry in nature. People never feel like others should have a say in what they do with their own lives, and bodies. However, this is not a new thing. It really is no different than outlawing drugs for the safety of society. (Especially drugs like heroin, cocaine, etc.)

We have laws to protect people because in general people seem to be incapable of overcoming their own over-emotional reactions to things. Yes, I believe fully in personal freedom.. but not at the expense of another's life, or well-being.

Pro-Choicers currently hold the opinion that their choices, (freedom) should be placed at a higher priority than the life of a human they have created through neglecting their responsibilities. (If you do not want to get pregnant, do not have sex.) It's really that simple.

People tend to have a very bad reaction to this logic usually. It is however ultimately the truth. If you can not take personal responsibility for the consequences of your actions -- then you should avoid engaging in activities with said consequences.

Sorry for the long rant, but hopefully at least a few of you agree with the sentiment.

I wish you all a great day and hope soon the day comes where we value unborn children's lives with equal worth as our own.

370,Lost a friend over the Ohio Bill,30,True,"So, clearly young feminist Pro-choice women are losing their freaking minds on the internet over the Ohio Bill.   My adult daughter's friend being one.  She posted some meme or link about how terrible it was for ""women's rights""...

I said something like ""well, really it's not that bad, because all a woman has to do if she is over the limit is to travel to a different State.""   

At which point about 6 other young feminist women chimed in and told me how horrible, limiting and classist that the bill was and how could any Pro-Choice woman support that? 

At which time, maybe because I had too much Mountain Dew, it was 3 in the morning on my birthday, but I just said screw it... and said ""Well... I'm not really a Pro Choice Woman.   Sure in extreme cases of rape, incest or severe health issues, I can see where some may want it as an option, but elective abortions due to finance or convenience.... no... I'm not Pro-choice."" 

Which brought on the onslaught of pretty really mean and nasty comments from this girls friends.  She remained somewhat civil, but also posted another post about how upset I made her because I commented that we couldn't be having this discussion if her (and their) mothers aborted them.  Which... I feel is a pretty fair and accurate point. 

I was well prepared to spend a chunk of my birthday having civil discussions (as civil as they would allow) with these young ladies.  However, my daughter just asked me to drop it and unfriend her friend.

Which I did, after a long and final post, which pretty much went over my points, of why I think killing unborn babies wrong, how birth control is a choice before sex, not after pregnancy.   Etc... I also mentioned how I was raised in a liberal pro-choice home and I once shared her exact same views until I became pregnant and realized that there really was a baby growing inside me and not some ""parasite"" to be ""gotten rid off"".  I just told her that maybe some day she may even have my views, but maybe not, but I still cared for her as a person. 

I also told her I was sorry for ""upsetting her"" with my views, but that she was a smart girl and sometimes people can benefit from hearing the other side, even if they don't agree with it.  

I'm sure that she replied, but I'm just going to respect my daughter's wishes.  I'm sure I have already embarrassed my daughter to death on social media.  Which, oh well.

400,Reasons for Abortion by State,20,True,"So one of the frustrating things about abortion reporting in the U.S. is that it's generally not very good -- the CDC's abortion reports are years behind and the reporting system is voluntary so a number of states opt out of reporting. However, there are a few states that keep pretty detailed records and 8 states have patients state their reason for getting their abortion. Some of the responses in the surveys are a bit different than the commonly cited 2004 AGI survey on reasons for abortion (the sample sizes in the states is a lot bigger.) The years are also more recent. FYI I calculated some percentages myself (and rounded them) so I might have made an error with some. (I didn't include abortions done for mental health reasons as being a ""hard"" case since that term is pretty subjective). 

[Oklahoma](https://www.ok.gov/health2/documents/HCI_2002-2015ITOPtrends_2.pdf) (2015): Rape - 0% Incest - 0% Fetal health reason (not specified) - .4%, Physical health of the mother is at risk -- .4%. 62% declined to provide a reason. ""Hard"" cases .8% of all reported reasons.

[Minnesota](http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/abrpt/2014abrpt.pdf) (2014): Rape - .7% Incest - .1%, Physical health -- 6%, Pregnancy would cause impairment of bodily function -- .4%, Fetal anomaly - 2%. 16% declined to answer. ""Hard"" cases 9.2% of reported reasons. 39% chose economic reasons, they could choose more than one reason. 69% said they didn't want the child. 

[Louisiana](http://dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/oph/Center-RS/healthstats/New_Website/ITOP/Ap12_T23.pdf): (2012): Rape/incest -- .2%, Physical health -- 2%, Risk of fetal deformity -- .6%. ""Hard"" cases 2.8% of all reasons. 

[Arizona](http://www.azdhs.gov/plan/documents/2014-arizona-abortion-report.pdf) (2014): Medical reasons (maternal health/fetal anomaly) -- 1.4%, Elective reasons -- 98.7%. ""Hard"" cases 1.4% of reported cases. Side note: There were 132 abortions done after 21 weeks, 48 were for fetal anomaly or maternal health, so that makes 84 (64%) done for non-medical reasons. 

[Utah](http://health.utah.gov/legislativereports/Abortions2015.pdf) (2015): Maternal life endangered -- .2%, Fetal anomaly -- 1%. ""Hard"" cases 1.2% of all reported reasons. 25 abortions were done after 21 weeks, 2 done for maternal life endangerment, 11 for fetal anomaly, nine were ""therapeutic"" and 3 elective. But the majority of abortions in Utah (68%) are classified as therapeutic so the term appears to be used loosely.  So 36% of Utah's late-term abortions are done for non-medical reasons, and 12% were classified as occurring for elective reasons. 

[South Dakota](https://doh.sd.gov/statistics/2015Vital/Abortion.pdf) (2015): Rape/incest -- 1.1%, Mother's bodily function would be impaired -- 2.9%, Fetal abnormality --1.4%. 0% declined to provide a reason. ""Hard"" cases 5.4% of all reasons. 47.3% of respondents said they couldn't afford the child (women could pick more than one) but not desiring the child has been the most commonly cited reason the past few years. 

[Florida](http://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/ReasonGestation_2015.pdf) (2015): Rape/incest -- .1%, Life threating condition of mother -- .1%, Non-life threatening condition of mother -- .2%, Fetal anomaly -- .7% ""Hard"" cases 1.1% of all reported reasons. 6% cited social or economic reasons, 92% classified as elective. 

[Nebraska](http://dhhs.ne.gov/publichealth/Abortion%20Reports/2015%20Statistical%20Report%20of%20Abortions.pdf) (2015): Rape -- .5%, Maternal life endangered -- .3%, Physical health -- 2%, Fetal anomaly -- .7% 25% declined to answer. ""Hard"" cases 3.5% of all reported cases. Socio-economic reasons cited in 11.7% of cases, most commonly cited reason was that contraception wasn't used (46.3%). Contraceptive failure cited in 14.8% of cases. 

[AGI](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdf) (2004): Rape -- 1%, incest -- .5%, Physical health -- 12%, Possible fetal health problems -- 13%. ""Hard"" cases 26.5% of all cases. 73% state they can't afford a baby now.  

AGI (2004), percentage citing ""hard"" case as most important reason: Rape -- <.5, Physical health -- 4%, Possible fetal health problem -- 3%. ""Hard"" cases <7.5% of the most important reported reason. 23% cited not being able to afford a baby as the most important reason.

I thought it was interesting that the number of ""hard cases"" cited in the states' records was generally fewer than cited in the AGI study, though the percentage citing a ""hard"" case as the most important reason in AGI more closely mirrored the states' records. Of course these 8 states aren't representative of the whole country. FL has by far the highest number of abortions occurring in the state every year among these states (over 70,000) but a very small percentage done for medical reasons or rape/incest. Also interesting that the percentage of women citing economic reasons was lower in these states than AGI's 73%. This [article](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html) goes into a ton more detail breaking down the reasons for abortion in reporting states over the years. 

Also interesting is the number of states that report on contraceptive use at the time of conception (Ohio, Oregon, and Minnesota). In MN's report it says that 61% didn't use contraception (53% used it before but not at the time of conception) 2% didn't know, and 31% used contraception. In [Ohio](https://www.odh.ohio.gov/-/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/health-statistics---vital-stats/Induced-Abortions-in-Ohio-2014.pdf?la=en) (2014) 24% of patients used contraception, 61% did not. 15% didn't report. 10% used condoms, 9% pills. In [Oregon](https://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/VitalStatistics/annualreports/Volume1/Documents/2015/Table0305.pdf), none was used in 63% of cases.10% used pills, 13% condoms, 10% other, 5% unknown. 3% of women in Oregon had four or more previous abortions.

Also out of all the states that I could find that report complications, Oregon had the highest percentage (3% of all abortions had some complication) of reported cases. Ohio has a lot more abortions performed per year than Oregon, but only .2% of the abortions in Ohio apparently resulted in a complication. So either the abortionists in Oregon are a lot more incompetent or a lot of complications in some states aren't reported. ",1480915257,5,2016-12-05 00:20:57
401,Amniocentesis (test for down syndrome) Leading People Astray with False Positives.,16,True,"Hello prolifers. I’ve wanted to post on here about this because it may come in handy to you one day during your prolife advocacy. 

I’ve been reluctant because I am not a statistician. However, my husband is and has taken the time to explain so I will do my best to share it with you.

As we know many children are being aborted because they are identified as having down syndrome due to diagnostic testing.

The Amniocentesis (which is the test used to detect down syndrome) is said to be 99% accurate.

But what does this mean? It means that if your child has down syndrome the test will detect it.

However, what they do not tell you is that there are many others who will receive a false positive. That is, your child does not have downs but the test says they do.

Here is the gist, if a preborn child screens positive for downs there is still only about a 7-11% chance that the baby actually has the syndrome (give or take depending on maternal age). 

That means out of 10 kids who screen positive only 1 will actually have downs.

This is very different then leading parents to believe their kid will almost definitely (99%) have downs.

I am going to see if I can find a good explanation to link to.

Hope this helps someone.

Just as an additional note, I think understanding statistics is going to be really important for people in the prolife movement.",1480871365,9,2016-12-04 12:09:25

I'm really conflicted about it because although it seems like a really incredible thing to do and quite a leap in medical progress, not to mention how important it must be to those moms for them to try such a thing, I've also heard that its very risky for baby as well as mom. Plus, they have had circumstances where the uterus is rejected during pregnancy and has to be removed, baby and all :(. 

And in a wider sense, is it wrong to try and conceive a child, knowing the risk of miscarriage is high? How about trying to conceive when there is not only a possibility, but a likelihood that circumstances may leave no choice but to end the pregnancy or die? Is it wrong to even attempt a uterine transplant?

I'm trying to get a clearer picture of the ProLife argument, and I figured it would make sense to just ask the prolife community. So here's my question:

I've read some of the documents on the side of this thread, and one of the documents mentions that the beginning of a human being starts at 'the union of male and female gametes or germ cells'

Would you say that this cell, at that moment, is to be considered a human being? And thus if someone were to destroy this cell, would they have comitted murder? Or is it the negation of the potential human life that is the issue, and by destroying that, you are, in a sense, murdering a future human being? 

If it is *not* a human being from the moment of fertilization, and the issue lies with the potential of human life, rather than actual human life, at what time of the pregnancy, according to your views, does the problem shift from the potential of life to actual life?

481,Open mind curious about /r/prolife on CO IUD study,2,True,"I am trying to get out of politics bubble and get perspective from other Americans, so I am looking for opinions here.  [Colorado ran a pilot study providing free IUDs to low-income women](http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/03/colorado-claims-contraceptive-program-caused-big-drop-in-teen-birth-rates/).  Abortion rates and teen birth rates fell by approximately 40%.  According to my napkinmath, should mandatory birth control coverage get repealed, the cost of such a program running indefinitely is ~$4/person/mo (or half a Netflix subscription*).  My liberal friends claim that almost no pro-life people would support such a plan, but I don't think they actually know.  So I am asking.

My questions for you: 

Would you pay $4/mo to provide non-abortifacient IUDs to women?  (Meaning spermicidal or hormonal IUDs that prevent ovulation, *not* IUDs that prevent implantation like the copper cross.)  


If yes, would you want restrictions on use (ex only giving them to women above 21)?  


Would you want a means-test to provide them for free to poor women, but at a discount to better-off women?  


Would you contribute more than $4/mo to have more impact?  


What are some flaws with this plan for you?  

Have I been fair in phrasing this?

Is this an OK kind of question to ask other pro-life groups?


I feel like if abortion is the loss of a child's life, that should be of paramount concern and $4/mo should not be very much money.  (The cause is more worth it than Netflix for half as much.)  This is separate from arguments about saving money on Medicare from unplanned births.  Many of my liberal friends are on board, but I want to know: what do you think?  Please educate me.

*: My math:  An IUD costs roughly $500, and last for roughly 5 years.  Half of the adult population is male, so we can estimate $/mo for a pair of people and clone the analysis to the whole population.  $500/5 years = $100/year / 12 months ~= $8/mo / 2 people ~= $4/mo ~= 0.5 Netflixes.  This estimate is slightly off, because not everyone actually wants an IUD their entire life, some people earn money without needing an IUD, and some people need an IUD but don't earn money.  However, these factors should not change the order of magnitude, and actually partially net against eachother.  ",1479272391,16,2016-11-15 23:59:51

495,Question about child support,0,True,"I have previously heard pro-lifers use the current child support laws as a part of their argument against legalized abortion.

Anyway, though, I was wondering this: Even from a pro-life perspective (I myself am pro-choice, for the record), would it genuinely be a bad thing to allow unwilling parents to refuse to pay child support (along with refusing to acquire any parental rights to these children of theirs, of course) in a scenario where all children are sufficiently cared for and where no additional taxpayer money would actually be on the line?

Basically, what I am thinking of here is a scenario where we will have a sufficiently large unconditional basic income for every person--including for every child. :) Indeed, considering that we currently don't legally require custodial parents who aren't on welfare to seek child support (or to give their children any legal recourse for this afterwards, for that matter), what exactly would the logic be in forcing unwilling parents to pay child support in a scenario where all children are already sufficiently well taken care of and where no additional taxpayer money would actually be on the line?

After all, this certainly *isn't* equivalent to abortion; indeed, there is *no* choice between death and continued existence in regards to child support! :)

108,Genuine question about Infertility for those who are pro-life,1,True,"I promise I am not trying to start a debate or argument. To prove it, I won't respond to any comments that get posted here. I am just genuinely curious about the pro-life position on my situation:

I have been trying to get pregnant but struggling with infertility for several years, and recently found out I have a medical condition that pretty much prevents fertilized eggs from implantation or if they do happen to fertilize and implant, makes it almost impossible to maintain the pregnancy. Basically I've had tons of early miscarriages where the pregnancy test is positive but then I ""get my period"" within the next few weeks (aka miscarriage). I haven't kept an official tally but I believe it's been around 15 times I have had this occur over the last several years. After finally visiting the fertility clinic and doing all the tests doctors discovered my condition and basically told me theres a very high chance if we keep trying to conceive that I will just keep having miscarriages and should start looking at other options (i.e. adoption/surrogacy). 

So my question is - if I continue trying to get pregnant, knowing full well that with each pregnancy the odds are way higher that it will end in miscarriage than that it will not, is this morally equivalent (in your eyes) to having an early term abortion? As I am knowingly allowing the egg to be fertilized and implant even though the chances of it's survival are pretty much nil. 

If you do believe it's equivalent, do you think there should be a law against women who are discovered to have this condition knowingly continuing to try to get pregnant (and how would that be implemented)?

If you believe it's not, please explain your thinking also. Thank you.",1478559184,16,2016-11-07 17:53:04

160,11 Children were aborted in England and Wales last year because they had Cleft Lip. How is this acceptable?,26,True,"11 may not seem like a big number, because its not. 11 CHILDREN however, puts it in a little more perspective. The British government funded the killing of these children because of a minor disability. 


For those who don't know what the day to day effects of [Cleft Lip/Cleft Palate](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cleft-lip-and-palate/Pages/Introduction.aspx) are they are as follows:
 
 * Trouble feeding the baby via breastfeeding or bottle
 * Possibility of being more vunreble to ear infections
 * Teeth may be at a higher risk of tooth decay
 * Possible speech problems
 * Noticable deformity

All of these symtoms can be fixed by:

 * Feeding support. ""Advice on positioning the baby"" or a ""specially-designed bottle""
 * Careful monitoring of hearing. If there are hearing issues a hearing aid in free in the UK
 * Speech and language therapy
 * Good dental hygiene and orthodontic treatment.
 
And what is most disgusting is that this deformity can be solved with simple surgery. Normally performed before 6 months, and rarely after 12 months. 


Given that the symptoms are so minor and solutions are so cheap and easy, why did these children have to die? Just because some woman deemed the childs life unworthy of living. ",1477695240,27,2016-10-28 18:54:00
163,Excerpt from SCOTUS 2007 Gonzales v. carhart Opinion (Graphic descriptions of abortion Procedures),6,True,"Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child’s development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No. 05–1382, pp. 45–48. The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU–486), to terminate the pregnancy. Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 464, n. 20. The Act does not regulate these procedures.

   Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester. The surgical procedure referred to as “dilation and evacuation” or “D&E” is the usual abortion method in this trimester. Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 960–961. Although individual techniques for performing D&E differ, the general steps are the same.

   A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 465; App. in No. 05–1382, at 61. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. See, e.g., Carhart, 331 F. Supp. 2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862–865, 868, 870, 873–874, 876–877, 880, 883, 886. A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix. The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that increase dilation. The resulting amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an individual patient will respond. In general the longer dilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate. Yet the length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies. Some may keep dilators in the cervix for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less. Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 464–465; Planned Parenthood, supra, at 961.

   After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman’s cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed. See, e.g., Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 465; Planned Parenthood, supra, at 962.

   Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus’ body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit. Carhart, supra, at 907–912; Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 474–475.

   The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on “partial-birth abortion,” including the Act, is a variation of this standard D&E. See M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), 1 Appellant’s App. in No. 04–3379 (CA8), p. 109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction). The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D&E variation. It has been referred to as “intact D&E,” “dilation and extraction” (D&X), and “intact D&X.” Nat. Abortion Federation, supra, at 440, n. 2; see also F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d ed. 2005) (identifying the procedure as D&X); Danforth’s Obstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B. Karlan, & A. Haney eds. 9th ed. 2003) (identifying the procedure as intact D&X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, & P. Stubblefield, A Clinician’s Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identifying the procedure as intact D&E). For discussion purposes this D&E variation will be referred to as intact D&E. The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D&E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes. There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D&Es are performed in this manner.

   Intact D&E, like regular D&E, begins with dilation of the cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure. To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree. This approach has been called “serial” dilation. Carhart, supra, at 856, 870, 873; Planned Parenthood, supra, at 965. Doctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D&E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators. See, e.g., Dilation and Extraction 110; Carhart, supra, at 865, 868, 876, 886.

   In an intact D&E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified:

   “If I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I use my forceps a little bit differently. I don’t close them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.” App. in No. 05–1382, at 74.

Rotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds of dismemberment. Carhart, supra, at 868–869; App. in No. 05–380, pp. 40–41; 5 Appellant’s App. in No. 04–3379 (CA8), p. 1469. A doctor also “may use forceps to grasp a fetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher level—sometimes using both his hand and a forceps—to exert traction to retrieve the fetus intact until the head is lodged in the [cervix].” Carhart, 331 F. Supp. 2d, at 886–887.

   Intact D&E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method of performing the operation. Dilation and Extraction 110–111. In the usual intact D&E the fetus’ head lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass. See, e.g., ibid.; App. in No. 05–380, at 577; App. in No. 05–1382, at 74, 282. Haskell explained the next step as follows:

“ ‘At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus and “hooks” the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).

“ ‘While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.

“ ‘[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.

“ ‘The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.’ ” H. R. Rep. No. 108–58, p. 3 (2003).

   This is an abortion doctor’s clinical description. Here is another description from a nurse who witnessed the same method performed on a 26-week fetus and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee:

   “ ‘Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby’s legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby’s body and the arms—everything but the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus… .

   “ ‘The baby’s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby’s arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.

   “ ‘The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby’s brains out. Now the baby went completely limp… .

   “ ‘He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.’ ” Ibid.

   Dr. Haskell’s approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and “the process has evolved” since his presentation. Planned Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 965. Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced “so that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.” App. in No. 05–380, at 41; see also Carhart, supra, at 866–867, 874. Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus’ skull. Carhart, supra, at 858, 881. Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it. Id., at 864, 878; see also Planned Parenthood, supra, at 965.

   Some doctors performing an intact D&E attempt to remove the fetus without collapsing the skull. See Carhart, supra, at 866, 869. Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because “the objective of [his] procedure is to perform an abortion,” not a birth. App. in No. 05–1382, at 408–409. The doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked whether he would “hold the fetus’ head on the internal side of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull” and kill the fetus before it is born. Id., at 409; see also Carhart, supra, at 862, 878. Another doctor testified he crushes a fetus’ skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure the fetus is dead before it is removed. For the staff to have to deal with a fetus that has “some viability to it, some movement of limbs,” according to this doctor, “[is] always a difficult situation.” App. in No. 05–380, at 94; see Carhart, supra, at 858.",1477655857,0,2016-10-28 07:57:37
169,Most Government Funded Sex Education Programs Ineffective,3,True,"I came across this [HHS report](http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/evaluation/grantee-led-evaluation/summary-ebps.pdf) (it was linked at [Live Action](http://liveactionnews.org/federal-report-planned-parenthoods-touted-sex-ed-programs-failure/)) which tracked the results of HHS Office of Adolescent Health Teen Pregnancy Program Grantees. Eighteen were comprehensive programs and one was an abstinence-based program. The majority of the programs were ineffective at getting teens to prevent pregnancy, use contraception consistently, prevent STI's, or delay sex. Among the ones that did have some results, most were only in the short-term. The [Tier 2](http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/evaluation/grantee-led-evaluation/summary-researchdemonstration.pdf) research and demonstration based programs were similarly ineffective in the long term for the most part. 

These results are kind of making me think that the whole abstinence education vs. comprehensive education debate is almost entirely pointless. It appears that neither approach decreases teen pregnancy or abortion all that much. I used to be in the ""comprehensive"" camp due to the studies finding abstinence programs to generally not work (or be counterproductive) but it appears comprehensive programs may be only marginally better. 

I still think schools should teach some kind of sex education but it seems like the government throwing millions into these programs is mostly a waste. I'm thinking at this point they should just be part of health classes and be biologically-based (rather than focusing entirely on abstinence or being extremely ""sex positive""). 

Of course there's probably a lot of variation in the content of the different programs and it's possible that there may be certain approaches that may have more results that haven't been discovered or publicized yet, but at this point I think it's safe to say that sex education hasn't played that big a role in the decline in teen pregnancy or the abortion decline in the past decades.

170,Statistics regarding late-term abortions (x-post r/prochoice),5,True,"Due to the topic being discussed in the US presidential debates, a lot of people from both sides have been commenting about late-term abortions. The pro-choice talking point seems to be that most late-term abortions are performed when the fetus would be non-viable/have significant health defects or when delivery would endanger the mother's health and well-being.  Unsurprisingly, many pro-lifers dispute this statement. But  I have not been able to find legitimate, objective studies that provide numbers to bolster either argument. 

The waters get murkier when talking about when specific procedures like D&E (or the controversial and much discussed  D&X) are performed. Emotions run high and a balanced discussion is almost impossible to find about these. After wading through blogs and articles from both sides, the only data that was repeated was an old NYT [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/26/us/an-abortion-rights-advocate-says-he-lied-about-procedure.html?_r=0) that contains a single person's opinion and is not much to go on. 

For such a hot-button issue such as abortion, I am sure a lot of studies have been conducted over the years and it would be great if someone could link some of them (in the US or elsewhere). Unlike a lot of facets of the abortion debate that are very subjective, this is one which may be effectively settled by numbers.

188,Mom condemning rhetoric - Doesn't this alienate those we are trying to reach?,3,True,"I am in a facebook group that started sharing pro life memes, and these are a couple that came up:

https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwib27zKxvTPAhXKWj4KHYjvDv0QjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fnonstopval%2Fquotes%2F&psig=AFQjCNHzFGB3pwaP0SyPLZ0NA7AHZGoSUw&ust=1477436655971360

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O7v47XIxBA4dY_9KgBbpESMWkpVsvgEsUVrHllZm9yCb_0Hhy1Zvq9elmgaqMfoGJ4sezKA=s115


I think some of these memes actually might do harm to the pro-life cause. Often, it seems that the burden is heaviest on healthcare providers and those that advise pregnant women, and not mothers. With abortion being legal, healthcare providers can advise it with whatever force and scare tactics they deem appropriate, if they foresee risk for mom or baby. I see this so often on labor and delivery, and even several women that are close to me in my life have undergone the horrible experience of being told that they either will not survive if they continue their pregnancy, or the baby will suffer worse if they do (both, thankfully, have chosen life.)

My heart breaks especially for the women who are counseled this way that don’t have the resources or understanding to choose life, however. These women are told that they do not have a choice, and they truly believe it. My perspective might be skewed, as when parents choose to deliver on the labor and delivery unit rather than under anesthesia in the operating room, they do so because they wish to meet the baby before he or she passes. It’s difficult to reconcile the pain and uncertainty these families experience with such condemning language.

I don’t want this to be taken the wrong way. I work in this field because I care deeply about young life, and I believe it begins at conception. My point is that I believe the pro-life rhetoric that is condemning of mothers (e.g. women choose abortion to maintain friends on social media, or to maintain a certain lifestyle, or because they lack of control over their sexual behavior) tends to alienate the people we are actually trying to reach. I know if someone makes an incorrect and uncharitable assumption about my motivations, I don’t listen to them, and probably become fairly closed off to what it is they stand for. So while there are many beautiful and honest things to say to persuade others to be pro-life, I wonder if the ugliness that is thrown at mothers who choose abortion actually has the effect of making women more likely to choose abortion, rather than less. 

Do you guys have a different take on this? Was anyone in this group converted from pro-choice to pro life from this kind of language? Has anyone here been in the situation of considering, or being pressured into abortion?

212,Shouldn't Christians be pro-Abortion?,2,True,"I realize this is a highly emotional topic and my question might be provocative. But I'm genuinely seeking an answer, and I'm posing this question with sincerity and respect. 

I'm an atheist and view abortions as particularly tragic. The reason abortions are so tragic to me is because I don't believe in an afterlife. So here's this tiny human, that managed to overcome astonishingly long odds of combining just the right cells and DNA, only to have its life snuffed out before it could begin. And it will never get the chance at this thing called life. Totally tragic to me.

But it struck me, shouldn't Christians feel the opposite of me? From what I understand about the Christian faith, innocent babies that die before having had the opportunity to hear about Jesus, go to heaven. So aren't aborted babies sort of getting a free ride to heaven for all eternity? Surely if these babies were born, at least half (probably more) would fail to embrace the Christian faith and be doomed to an eternity in hell (or at least not heaven). So by being a Christian pro-lifer, aren't you sort of condemning a large portion of these babies to an eternity in hell instead of heaven? Granted, the babies have missed out on this life on earth, but isn't that a small price to pay for a guaranteed eternity in heaven? After all, this life on earth is just the tiniest sliver of time, just a blink of an eye, compared to all eternity. 

I'm interested in hearing how Christian pro-lifers think about this. Thanks for the comments.",1476983638,23,2016-10-20 13:13:58
215,The downfalls of Identity Politics,4,True,I feel like the abortion issue is one issue that has really been overtaken by identity politics in the US. The right wing/republican party have taken a strong stance against access to abortion while the left wing/democratic party has taken a hard stance in favor of abortion access. It's hard to have a discussion on abortion when the debate has been hijacked by two parties that lump abortion in with a bunch of other unrelated things. Your view on gun ownership shouldn't have any predictive factor over your thoughts on abortion. It would be philosophically consistent even to be a pro-life liberal. It's almost like pro-life liberals really have no home in American politics today and this detracts from having a real discussion.

229,Shower Thoughts,0,True,"So a lot of pro choice people think that making abortion illegal will start a big underground movement, coat hangers and all of that. I think this is putting the cart before the horse. If abortion is indeed murder ( it is ), it should be treated as such.

Any doctor or woman attempting to kill their child, should without a doubt spend the rest of their life in jail. I think this is obvious. You cannot take a life, especially premeditated without major repercussions. Now I am not aware of what the previous laws were prior to Roe v Wade. Where women getting second handed abortions and not being jailed and arrested? What about the horror stories of women throwing babies in the garbage? Did they serve any life sentences? I think no. I feel like abortion is one of those things that has no teeth to it's illegality. People say it's murder but are unwilling to make them pay for their crimes for those involved.

Also, I feel that in the current state of the world, pro life is never going to win out. I do however feel if we concede the fight on this level and focus on winning elsewhere we can win.

If we can remove a woman's bodily autonomy from the pregnancy, the pro choice side completely loses it's teeth. You are killing the child out of mere inconvenience and for financial reasons. That is a much easier win. We need to build programs that can really provide a good life for these unwanted children, we can't just say this is wrong and be unwilling to do the hard work with maintaining our morals. We are on the moral right and we are obligated to put in more. Because it matters more to us.

232,Pro-lifer wondering about signage at PP protests,8,True,"Hi all -- I recently attended a Catholic mass outside a planned parenthood clinic.  I am Catholic and pro-life and couldn't help but notice others there protesting with some very graphic signage and shouting over the fence at people who were walking in to the clinic.

How effective are these horribly graphic signs (They would likely be PG-13 or R rated if it was in a theater.). The shouting?

Granted, it's not like God swooped down during Mass and blocked the doors of the clinic, but there are stories of PP docs becoming Catholic or otherwise turning against the abortion crowd.  Women ultimately deciding privately to not abort, etc...  Divinity at work there, perhaps.

240,Thoughts on saving rejected zygotes?,5,True,"Hi, I am Prochoice but am really curious about the Prolife position. I live in a very liberal area so there are not many people who are pro life to begin with. Those that are do not want to discuss the issue because it is tied in with their religious beliefs and thus very personal. 

Anyway, my question has to do with abortions of genetically defective zygotes. Many people oppose such abortions however the body naturally screens against genetically abnormal zygotes and prevents them from implanting into the uterus. My question is should we work to prevent the natural abortion of these zygotes and allow for more abnormal fetuses to develop, leave the body to its devices, or use artificial techniques to prevent more defective zygotes from attaching? 

I understand that those who champion prolife do not exist as a monolith and draw their lines at different points. I am not trying to pick a fight and have you defend the entire movement Im just curious to know what you believe.

242,Moral difference between preventable miscarriage and abortion?,7,True,"Hey folks! Middle-of-the-roader here, just gathering responses to some of what I consider the most interesting questions on the controversy.


I have a couple of married friends who have a known hormonal imbalance that makes it very difficult for them to have children. Knowing about this issue, they have tried several times to have a child, and have had four or five miscarriages as a result. Their situation is one thing that makes it difficult for me to view a fertilized egg as a full human being (because it seems like if this is the case, this couple willfully took steps that they knew would kill four or five people, just so they could have a baby).

Is there a significant moral difference between this couple, and someone who has an abortion? If a couple with known hormonal issues (>80% chance of miscarriage) wanted to try for a baby, what's the rational for allowing them to do so?

248,Pro-choice individual seeking Better Understanding,5,True,"Salutations.

tldr: Please help educate a pro-choice individual. Not looking to argue, mostly just curious.

I'm a person who generally leans pro-choice, but I don't feel especially certain of that position (at least in a ""gut sense""). At the moment I feel that position of pro-choice makes the most sense to me based on my current understanding, but there's certainly information I could be missing or arguments I'm misunderstanding. I've tried to do what reading I can on my own, but there's always a danger in that of confirmation bias or a blind spot. I genuinely would like to seek out information contrary to that I already have.

I apologize if these are reasons you have heard very often and feel are already debunked, but I browsed the side-bar to see if it could already assist me, and I didn't feel my reasons were really addressed. I'm not looking to debate these points, in that I am not trying to assert them as true. These reasons represent my current understanding (whether true or false), and I present as background information.
___________________

1) I do not believe in the supernatural. I state this to be upfront that I won't find any case made on this basis to be convincing.
___________________

2) I believe the pro-choice movement achieves the stated goals of the pro-life movement, but not by its desired methods. That is, pro-choicers seem to be able to have their cake and eat it too. Before I elaborate, I'll say this is not my primary reason, it is a contingent reason (meaning if I'm not wrong about this, then nothing else really matters). The primary goal of the pro-choice movement is to reduce the abortion rate as much as possible, and make the few exceptions as safe as possible. My understanding of the pro-life movement is that one of its primary goals is to make abortion illegal. My understanding is also that abortion restrictions are wholly ineffective at reducing the abortion rate. There are also several methods we know are quite effective at reducing the abortion rate (such as birth control, sex education, government assistance), and nearly all are strongly embraced by the pro-choice movement. While I realize the pro-life movement is somewhat in a state of flux, and of course it is not a homogenous group of individuals, in the past (and probably still in the present) there appears to be a lot of affiliation with groups that oppose the most effective means of reducing the abortion rate.

Thus from my perspective, pro-choicers appear to oppose ineffective means of reducing abortions (illegalization), and ally with groups that support effective means of reducing abortions. Pro-lifers appear to be focused on pursuing an completely ineffective means of reducing abortion, and maybe even having some affiliations with groups/policies that drive it up.
___________________

3) I find the line in drawn in the sand to be quite arbitrary. Honestly this goes for both groups, but I find the point of viability argued for by pro-choicers to be at least consistent with the argument for bodily autonomy (the government can't force a mother to donate her organs to a fetus any more than they can me to my dying grandfather). It's not the greatest, but it appears to me less arbitrary than the alternative.

The pro-life position of at conception does not make sense to me. This is often concisely stated as ""life begins at conception"", but I see that as scientifically false. Life doesn't begin at conception, life begins before conception. Sperm and eggs are every bit alive and every bit human. I've heard some arguments claiming the change in DNA represents a unique person and thus a beginning, but I find this weak. This would mean that that monozygotic twins only count as one person, and that a person with chimerism counts as two or more people. I also don't think there is anything inherently special about a new strand of DNA, and it can also be said the that mitochondrial DNA has stayed the same throughout the process.

I get the impression that when pro-life individuals say ""I believe life begins at conception"" what they really mean is ""I believe a soul/human essence begins at conception"". IF this is so, then it ventures into supernatural territory, which I do not find to be convincing.

I guess what I would like to know is where I might have made an error or what I might be missing. This isn't the entirety of my perspective, but these are some key parts, and if I'm wrong here then I certainly need to engage in further reconsideration.

I hope I have not struck you as rude. From my browsing of this community it seems to have a generally pleasant demeanor with the majority of the individuals having good intentions.

People are going to think that we planned this. This group never contacted us or anything like that. It's just frustrating sometimes.

259,My argument against abortion that doesn't involve Christianity,9,True,"Due process is interpreted from the 14th amendment. It is protecting a right that all people share. Here, the right is bodily autonomy (like abortion or homosexual sex). Here, this is given strict scrutiny protection. This means that no law can take away the bodily autonomy unless it is neccesary to a compelling governmental interest (up to the courts standard for why is the law necessary and if the interest is compelling).

With abortion, they did not go with the usual strict scrutiny, but chose a trimester approach in Roe. Then it was changed into what we have now - an undue burden standard (From Casey). This means that before the point of viability in a fetus, there can be no law restricting abortion that would cause an undue burden to recieve an abortion. This has been loose here, but that is a different argument, not one I am making. After viability, laws can restrict abortions entirely (except in the health of a mother), because that is the point that the law protects the unborn child. The court determined this arbitrary point of viability. My argument is thus. The point of viability is bad. We need to use the precautionary principal and say that the child has rights from conception.

Now, here is why Roe should be unconstitutional. I will even give you the point that women have a fundamental right to choice to have an abortion. I stipulate that is true. But the Court in Roe has said, ""[i]f this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.” This means, if there is life, the fundamental right to life wins over woman's fundamental right to choice.

So when is life? Since there is scientific uncertainty today over when a life is a life, the Court should handle the abortion issue differently. They should not come up with a magic point in time (whether it be when the heart beats, when the child could live on its own, etc.) that determines life as that is plainly nonsensical. What should be done is when there is scientific uncertainty, like there is when determining life, the Court needs to err on the side of caution. When we do not know whether the child has reached a stage where it has the right to life, we should assume that it does have the right to life, as this will do least damage to the child. In Stenberg v. Carhart, Justice Kennedy (who was in the majority in Casey) agreed with this point when he stated that “courts must exercise caution . . . when medical uncertainty is present.” This is what is widely known as the “precautionary principal.” This states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public, environment, or in our case, life itself, then in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action or making a judgment that may or may not be a risk. This not only protects the life of a child by protecting it starting at the point of conception, but it also promotes the best interest of the child (what better interest is there than life itself?). Therefore, with all of this information, it is clear and obvious that life should be held to begin at the point of conception.

Thus, since women and men have bodily autonomy rights, what wins out? The choice to abort or life. In these situations, the court has a balance of the interest test. Which interest is more important. My argument is life outweighs 9 months. Even the court says so in Roe. They explain that if life was found at conception, then it outweighs choice. Thus, the court agrees with me if they use the precautionary principal. it doesn't matter what you or I think. They did not use the precautionary principal though and that is where I believe they are wrong. They chose an arbitrary point in time. Now you say to follow precedent (this is called stare decisis in law). I say yes, we do need to follow precedent. However, sometimes the courts go against precedent in case law. For example, in abortion, the precedent was strict scrutiny, then trimester, then undue burden. The precedent changed. Same with separate but equal. Precedent changes and it should here based on the precautionary principal. There is a lot more, but this is a condensed version of it.",1476139901,8,2016-10-10 18:51:41

304,Some were interested in reading my story. I figured I'd post it. Beware of Graphic details.,37,True,"Almost no-one knew about my abortion until recently. Even now, it's a big secret my husband and I share, and I've never actually given anyone the details. I've started writing this over and over, never with any success. I owe this to the child I had for such a brief time, and to all the mothers out there, to tell my story so hopefully some will find safer, non-terminal options for dealing with an unplanned pregnancy.

We found out we were expecting a child when my husband (who was my boyfriend at the time) was a week away from starting school. We had lived together for 2 or 3 years. I was still dealing with some PTSD issues from a previous situation. I was healing, still. I wasn't stable. My boyfriend and I were both petrified. He was petrified of letting down his parents by having a child too soon, I was petrified to end-up like my own mother who was a young mom and had to receive government help for a long time so we could survive. I hadn't graduated high school. I hadn't gone to college. My brain was broken from years of trauma. We didn't have a lot of money. The odds were stacked against us, and we felt backed into a corner.

When I saw the + sign on the pregnancy test, I went straight to the hospital to get a blood test to confirm the pregnancy. The kind doctor at the hospital did this for me. That's when I told the doctor that I couldn't go through a pregnancy. Keep in mind that I hadn't known for 3 hours that I was pregnant at this point. I felt numb and stunned. The first doctor left the room, a second one entered, confirmed that I wanted a referral to end the pregnancy, and then referred me to the Family Planning clinic on the 3rd floor of the [REDACTED] Hospital. I went home for the night, and cried for many hours. I never, ever thought I would find myself in that situation. My boyfriend was as supportive as he could, but I don't think he knew what to say. He was as confused as me, and looking back on it, I don't think he got the support he needed. My mental health issues aggravated everything I was feeling. I was drowning in despair, and I never for a million years believed that I could ever be a good mother. That thought alone is the main reason I went through with the abortion eventually. So many people and situations in my past had broken my ability to believe in myself. My boyfriend and I desperately needed support that we never got.

I think it was a few days later when I got a call from the Family Planning clinic. An appointment was made to talk to an ob/gyn who did these procedures. I went to the appointment. I think my husband had to work that day. I never got any counseling before-hand, though I was told most women got this from the Sexual Health Center in my town. I spoke with the ob/gyn for a while, then I was shipped off to another office where a Nurse Practitioner explained the procedure. She explained in a very even, unfeeling tone that I would have a D+C with vacuum aspiration, and what that entailed. As she got into the gritty details, I burst out crying. She handed me a box of tissues without interrupting herself, and kept on talking through my tears. I don't remember everything she said. I felt so alone, and the whole thing didn't feel real to me. By the time I left her office, I felt numb and completely unfeeling. This kind of ""empty-headedness"" happened a lot as a result of my PTSD. I'd have a major crying fit, and then it's like all my emotions would shut-down. I walked around like a ghost. Emotionally, a lot of the time, I was just an empty shell. Before I left, the nurse made me pick a birth control method (though I was on birth control when I got pregnant). She told me I had no choice but to pick something. I agreed to an IUD, mostly because she said I didn't have a choice. The date for my procedure was set for 2 weeks later.

For those 2 weeks, my boyfriend and I talked about the whole thing endlessly, and we couldn't come to a decision. I cancelled my appointment, then I rescheduled it... None of it felt right. In my head, I begged who-ever might be listening to let me keep my baby even if I felt like I had no choice in the matter. My husband wasn't ready for a baby, and I was worried he would resent me if I ""forced a baby"" on him. What would his parents think? Until the night before I was due to have the procedure, we talked and talked. Under all the pressure, I eventually went to the pharmacy, got the pills I needed to start the process (2 intra-vaginal pills to start dilating my cervix) and used them.

At first, I didn't feel anything, so I wondered if the pills were working at all, but in the night (at about 4 am), I woke-up in a lot of pain. I was bleeding so much it was worrisome. Despite my concern, I waited until the morning and headed for my procedure that was scheduled for early that morning. We first went to the ER because I was so worried about how much I was bleeding, but the triage nurse told me I was OK. We went to the right surgery area, somewhere on the main floor, and waited for someone to come get us.

When my name was called, a nurse instructed me to take all my clothing off and gave me a gown to wear. They gave me an IV. I waited some more in the prep area. Another, even younger girl was in the bed next to mine. She was crying a lot. I asked the attending nurse to tell the girl that I was there if she needed to talk. The nurse eventually came back to say that the girl declined.

Eventually, the time came for my turn. They wheeled me into a very sterile OR with a big light at the ceiling. The doctor was all scrubbed-up. A nurse put my feet in stirrups and took off my gown. I felt very, very exposed (really, I was). The doctor told me there was a male student who would be witnessing the procedure. My permission for this non-essential staff was never asked. I felt completely violated. I was so cold, and the doctor was taking forever to be ready to operate. I was laying there, my most private parts pointing at a doctor, some guy-student, and at least 2 nurses. I felt so embarrassed and exposed that I asked for a blanket. A nurse carelessly tossed a folded sheet on my belly. She didn't even care enough about my comfort to spread the blanket to cover me, so I did it myself. The nurse gave me ibuprofen and something ""to relax"" via IV. I saw the ceiling start to get away from me because of the drugs (just a bit  of Ativan). I felt a bit dizzy, but I was very conscious. The doctor gave me two injections of freezing to my cervix. They were terribly painful. I started to hyperventilate. A nurse they called ""the signing nurse"" held my hand and rubbed my forehead, but I felt like I was losing it. The doctor them performed the D+C, which is basically like taking a butter knife to the lining of the uterus. It hurt like nothing I ever felt before. I screamed and shouted at the doctor to stop. She said we couldn't stop anymore, and kept going. Then she used a vacuum to aspirate the remains of my baby. I screamed some more. It hurt like nothing I've ever experienced before. I was told that it would hurt ""like a bad period"", and let me tell you that I've had periods my whole life, and that did not hurt like any period I've ever had. After a few minutes, the pain stopped, and I was wheeled into the recovery room. My boyfriend came to see me. He tried to lighten the mood as best he could, but I was just numb and empty.


I wish this was the end of the story. Fallowing my D+C, I kept bleeding and bleeding and bleeding... The doctor at the Family Planning clinic (and ER) were saying this was ""normal"" because I was filling a menstrual pad in 20 minutes, and not 15 (which is their marker for what they measure as potentially dangerous amount of bleeding). Eventually, After almost a month of bleeding this badly on-and-off (it would increase and then decrease a little bit), I found a way to call the Family Planning clinic directly, and the doctor who performed my D+C agreed to have me come in for an ultra-sound. She was clearly in a rush when I came in (and she didn't hide her annoyance with me, but I didn't care anymore at that point), and did the ultra-sound in about 10 seconds flat. She then said dismissively that ""the placenta is still there"" and walked out of the room without acknowledging me. A nurse came in and told me I'd need either a repeat of the procedure, or that they could give me the same intra-vaginal pills I took before my abortion and hope the placenta would pass. The second option sounded like it wasn't a sure way to remove the placenta, I agreed to have a second procedure. Thanks be to God, that procedure was scheduled to be done under complete anesthetic.

That procedure went very well. I stopped bleeding after about a week. I had bled like crazy for almost a month before any of the people at the clinic cared to take a look at me. I had to take antibiotics too for the infection.

After the shock of the two procedures, the trauma of it all started to set in. I drank sometimes because I wanted to forget. I couldn't sleep anymore. I missed my baby so, so much. It's like even if my baby was gone, I my attachment to her had grown regardless. I was devastated. My boyfriend didn't know how to comfort me, but he was doing his best. He stayed with me every step of the way, but the abortion caused irreparable damage to our relationship. We both struggled. I agreed to go to the Sexual Health Center for post-abortion support. This was a terrible, terrible idea. It felt like the two nurses I spoke to were ganging-up against me. They kept telling me that because my baby was ""never really a baby"", I was ""making-up my grief"". They dismissed every emotion I had because, to them, my child never existed. They kept repeating that I was making-up my grief, and that what I had done was the best decision for my situation. One of them even said that she had had a miscarriage, and that because it was never actually a baby, I should be like her and not grieve at all.

I had an epiphany when I came out of their office, so in a way, I'm grateful for that encounter. I realized how wrong they were in that moment, and I took my first step towards real recovery: I admitted to myself that I regretted my abortion, and that my baby had been a real person that I was right to grieve. Once I came to that realization, it was a lot easier to work through the pain. I started writing letters to my baby. I apologized in thought and writing to her/him over and over. I gave her/him a name. I bought a necklace with what should have been her/his birth stone and wore it for comfort. I connected with other women who had a similar experience to mine and I was able to externalize my grief. 


Eventually, I came to realize how truly unnatural abortion is, and how it really throws every aspect of your life and relationships out of balance. I've had two children since, and I still miss my first little angel who never had the chance to be born. I've learned to live with the choice I made over time, but I'll always grieve my child (and another baby I lost in miscarriage). Women deserve better than abortion. We deserve support and love during that vulnerable time. Eventually, I received help for my PTSD and for other at-the-time undiagnosed mental health issues. I've been recovering since, but having an abortion set my recovery back for a couple of years at least.

When I went to the Family Planning clinic to complain about the traumatic nature of the procedure, and about not being warned about the level of pain I'd experience, a nurse told me that some women experience the pain I experienced, but that she didn't tell me it might happen because she didn't want to ""change my mind"". I think that answer says a lot.

I also want to mention that my abortion, had the laws been fallowed, would have never happened. The laws in my province required two doctors to agree that my abortion was done for my health, and my health was never questioned at any point in time. My abortion was done, on tax-payer's dime, at the [REDACTED], for purely elective reasons.

309,I went to my first pro-life thing today!,22,True,"I was invited to go to the Chain of Life event after Mass today. I'm in the process of converting to Orthodoxy, but since my church is another city (so is the Menno church where I'm mostly established), I attend Mass most weekends.

It went great! We mostly stood quietly with visible, but low-key signs. We were on a main drag of road so we got lots of visibility. There were counter-protesters on the other side of the road. They were mostly very noisy young women and teen girls with big ""Honk if pro-choice"" signs (they were all female, actually). Their stance definitely seemed more popular, going by the number of cars honking, but we still got plenty of thumbs up from drivers. They never engaged us, and we never engaged them. I think that's a good thing, in the interest of keeping things peaceful.

There's a week-long prayer vigil from 1300-1500 in front of our local hospital (which performs abortions). I'd really like to go. I became pro-life following an abortion in my youth at that very hospital. These people treat women like cattle, and it's fairly well-known in pro-life circles. Unfortunately, their poor treatment of abortive patients isn't talked about much because it doesn't serve the typical pro-""choice"" rhetoric. I'm willing to talk to people about my botched procedure and following complications, if it helps get the word out there.

The Catholic church was my refuge after my experience. They were the only ones to understand my grief, my regret, and to not judge me to falling for the pro-abortion rhetoric. I take responsibility for what I did completely, but the doctors who know better and did my procedure are taking women for a ride. I wish more people knew what this hospital did to me, and to so many other women.

I know I can't really ""make-up"" for the decision I made, but I do this to do right by the baby I lost.

311,Questions about the right to life.,5,True,"First, please let me know if you feel I'm inaccurate about, misrepresent or misunderstand any point here.  It may not necessarily change my opinion, but my intent is to try to see this from different points of view.  While I do come from a pro-choice standpoint, I nevertheless think the concept of the right to life is an important one to understand, particularly because the protection of that right (of the lack of that protection) has deep and wide-ranging implications.  One of the most frequent comments I see in support of the pro-life / anti-abortion viewpoint is that because the fetus is a unique biological entity (separate and unique genetic makeup) it possesses the same right to life as an adult person.  That reasoning prompts my questions here.

Is the right to life a function of natural biology? Is there a special set of criteria that must be met in order for an entity to possess a right to life? Does the right to life apply solely to biological humanity, or something more - the concept of personhood?  If it is based solely, or primarily on biological humanity, then are all biologically-human entities persons? Or can it be that some humans are not persons?  What about nonhuman beings; can anything nonhuman be categorized as a person and receive the same rights to life that you and I share?  If so, if a non-human entity can conceptually be considered a person with a right to life, what impact does that have on the biology-based argument for the right to life?

330,A pro-choice argument I'd really love to hear a pro-lifer's response to.,7,True,"Hey all. Abortion neutral myself here. I'm mixed on the issue of abortion, but recently this thought popped into my head that I would love to hear your criticism on. Unlike many pro-choicers I am not bound to my mindset, I am open to hearing it change, so I hope we can all engage in a productive convo here.

Now the argument is this:

To people who are against abortion, would you be comfortable entrusting the awesome responsibility of raising a member of society to a person who lacked the responsibility to avoid getting pregnant when they weren't ready to?

Let me put it this way. If you are a woman or man who had sex, when you were shy age 23, unmarried, had no good education, had a subpar or no job, and then you chose to get pregnant...

You are not a very responsible or intelligent person are you? (This excludes rape victims and is talking about people who got pregnant by irresponsible decisions).

So you're a person who is not very smart or responsible.

So to the Pro-lifers: Would you be comfortable entrusting this kind of person to raise a child, who later on, will be a member of you and your children's society?

These kids grow up to become criminals. These kids grow up to vote. These kids grow up to influence your society. How someone is raised is really really important.

Do you really want people not smart/responsible enough to keep themselves from getting pregnant prematurely to raise kids? Do you think they have the intelligence needed to effectively raise kids who will become productive in society?

And you might point out adoption, but isn't the foster/orphanage system at capacity?

I'd like to ask a question that isn't about specific issue stances, since we already know where the candidates (claim to) stand on the issue; it'd be nice to find out about the philosophical underpinnings of their stances for once, and see how much thought they've given to that. I'm thinking of submitting a question asking the candidates when they believe a human being gains personhood, but I'm not sure what category to put it in, or how to phrase it so that it's as immune as possible to weasely responses that don't actually answer the core question. I was thinking something along the lines of this:

> Regardless of any specific policy proposals you may have, when in the spectrum of development do you believe a human being attains moral personhood, and thereby gains rights that should be protected by the government, and why do you believe this?

These are the kinds of non-answers I want to nip in the bud with my wording:

> ""Well, I think that that's a deeply personal question that the government can't hope to answer, and so we should leave that decision up to a woman and her doctor, and blah blah blah…""

*This is entirely disingenuous. Everyone knows you'd never say this about infanticide, so you must have a cutoff point. What is it, and why?*

> ""Let me tell you this. I am a strong believer in the sanctity of life, believe me, and if elected I will do everything in my power to yadda yadda yadda…""

*We understand that you know the policy positions you're supposed to have as a Republican, but what's behind that? Do you believe life begins at conception? If you do, how do you square this belief with your stance that abortion should be allowed in the case of rape? Are you just offering that as a political concession, or do you actually believe that? If you actually believe that, is there an actual reason behind this seeming inconsistency?*

> ""I think that whichever side of the issue you're on, we can both agree that we need to decrease the abortion rate, which we can do by blabbity blabbity blabbity…""

*Okay, great, but if we already agree, there's no need to bring it up. The question was about your beliefs.*

I'm trying to word the question such that if a candidate responds to the question with standard, boilerplate pro-choice/pro-life talking points, it'll be clear that said candidate is simply dodging.

384,The basic problem with pro-choice definitions of life,12,True,"Being a member of the sub, you have no doubt heard the argument that if you ask a group of pro-choicers when life begins or when the cut off for abortion should be, you will get a wide variety of answers. This speaks to the consistency of their philosophy in supporting abortion rights over the right to life.

I want to tackle the four general answers you will get to this question. 

From the stereotypical radical feminist or leftist on a university campus, you might hear that he/she wants no restriction on abortion whatsoever, that abortion for all intents and purposes should be considered a form of birth control. This is rarer among the pro-choice demographic, but on the rise on college campus communities. This argument is relatively easy to dismantle in terms of an ethical dilemma, so much so that most people who consider themselves ""pro-choice"" would never support this position. What has to be asked is what significantly changes between the state of being that an unborn child exists on its final day in the womb compared to the day it is born? The answer of course is nothing. Therefore these people rely on a stance of mere legality, which as we know from history is not really a moral argument at all.

The other three responses sound off as somewhat legitimate answers on the surface. They are meant to appear as though your opponent is giving you a compromise and expects you to meet them in the middle. The three most common ones I hear relate to heartbeat, brain waves, and independent viability.

All three of these answers have the exact same problem, consistency of application. If your opponent says that  life doesn't begin until the heartbeat is present, or brain waves are present or the child can survive on its own outside of the mother, they are making the admission that to terminate a being that matches their criteria would be murder. As such, most of these people, who are not just morally posturing to make their argument sound more tolerable or moderate, would advocate a policy that ""abortion is acceptable after X weeks"".

As I said the problem with making any of these situations the cut off is that no unborn child achieves these conditions at the exact same moment across the board. Children don't all begin showing signs of heart or brain activity at X weeks. Children, in addition to having no reliable indicator for individual viability, also don't categorically achieve it at X weeks. Some achieve it earlier and some later. In our current system perhaps you can detect a heartbeat in any individual case. But as far as I've been able to tell, most pro-choicers have been leaning toward the other two options as of late.

We do not have the convenience of technology to detect brainwaves in every single unborn child when assessing a pregnancy. We do not have anywhere close to a standard that determines the exact moment of viability. And therefore, if one touts a policy of ""X weeks is an acceptable cut off point to legal abortion"" they are almost guaranteed to commit murder even by the pro-choicer's own definition of the term. If a child develops a heartbeat or brainwaves one week before this deadline. If a miracle happens, and historically it has that a child achieves viability before this legal cut off date, then you have allowed for that child's murder by abortion. One week too late, even one second too late, and that is the death of someone that they claim to consider a person. That should incite an ethical panic to any who do genuinely care about deciding life and death for somebody else.

There are, of course, other arguments to dispute their ideals for abortion laws, but the question of consistency may be the most important because they cannot argue against it from any mainstream moral high ground without lying or talking in circles; much like Eboni Williams in her debate with Ben Shapiro. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBW-fMFDlPk)

If the pro-choicer is consistent in their views then this is the necessary end result. And so a situation like abortion should be treated with at least caution on the side of life.
If there are any such people here who want to debate me on the topic I'm interested in having the discussion.

386,Debate: Why should a secular pro lifer oppose embryonic stem cell research?,5,True,"One of my main arguments as a secular pro lifer is that the fertilized egg is biologically living and taxonomically speaking, human.

That is, I don't believe in a soul, but I believe in a right to life for the unborn whose process of development is underway.

I say this on the basis of the concept ""negative and positive rights"" where a negative right, such as life, is one that every human maintains unless it is taken by force and a positive right, unlike life, must be given by authority or group recognition.

Most of us here might agree with that argument on the basis that the fertilized embryo is undoubtedly living and human. And without the unnatural intervention of a third party, it will develop into a functioning developed person. Therefore it should be protected.

That is my secular argument.

This argument of mine goes out the window in a laboratory setting where the egg itself is artificially inseminated outside of a womb. That embryo will never be a developed human being.

So why should I oppose that, assuming I don't believe in a soul?

395,Here is why abortion is unconstituional,4,True,"Now, here is why Roe is unconstitutional. I will even give you the point that women have a fundamental right to choice to have an abortion. I stipulate that is true. But the Court in Roe has said, ""[i]f this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.” This means, if there is life, the fundamental right to life wins over woman's fundamental right to choice.

So when is life? Since there is scientific uncertainty today over when a life is a life, the Court should handle the abortion issue differently. They should not come up with a magic point in time (whether it be when the heart beats, when the child could live on its own, etc.) that determines life as that is plainly nonsensical. What should be done is when there is scientific uncertainty, like there is when determining life, the Court needs to err on the side of caution. When we do not know whether the child has reached a stage where it has the right to life, we should assume that it does have the right to life, as this will do least damage to the child. In Stenberg v. Carhart, Justice Kennedy (who was in the majority in Casey) agreed with this point when he stated that “courts must exercise caution . . . when medical uncertainty is present.” This is what is widely known as the “precautionary principal.” This states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public, environment, or in our case, life itself, then in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action or making a judgment that may or may not be a risk. This not only protects the life of a child by protecting it starting at the point of conception, but it also promotes the best interest of the child (what better interest is there than life itself?). Therefore, with all of this information, it is clear and obvious that life should be held to begin at the point of conception.

Now, going back to Roe. Roe says that if there is life, life wins over choice. Thus, since life is at conception, it wins over choice and abortion is unconstitutional. But, there still if a fundamental right to bodily autonomy (like choosing who you want to have sex with - Lawrence v. Texas). Just no abortions from balance of the rights in favor of life.",1473982189,21,2016-09-15 19:29:49
