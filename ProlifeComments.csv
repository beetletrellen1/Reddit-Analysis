1,"That makes more sense then, sorry if I misunderstood.

In my experience people who say ""I just don't think abortion should be used as a form of birth control"" are pro-choicers. Those are the only people I hear saying that. ",1,1521942908,2018-03-24 21:55:08
2,"&gt; Aren't you answering your own question?

Thanks for the reply. 

I never asked a question. I stated my position in my post and wanted feedback.

&gt;  It really doesn't have anything to do with what a fetus is. 

It has *everything* to do with what a fetus is. A fetus is either an unborn child or not. You can't have it both ways. 

- The crux of the pro-choice debate is that what they're killing isn't a child/baby. 
- You don't just ""become human"" at a certain stage. 
- A good many do NOT want to face up to the fact that what is in their stomach, is in fact, an unborn child.

&gt; I don't see the contradiction.

Because you see that the only difference in the situations is the *expectant mother's intent*. Whether or not she wants the pregnancy/baby. And I sincerely appreciate that you see that. :)

The intent never changes the outcome (a baby dying)

Most pro-choicers won't acknowledge that.

-----------------

A pro-choicer likes to argue that that the ""situational context"" of ""abortion"" or ""miscarriage"" determines whether or not a fetus is an ""unborn child"". 

Pro-choice (abortion): It's not an unborn child, it's not a baby, you're not killing a baby it's a lump of cells..etc.
Pro-choice (miscarriage at any stage): Mourns the loss of their baby and refers to the fetus as such.

If you can get them to acknowledge/admit that the fetus is an ""unborn child"" regardless of circumstance...you can force them to acknowledge that what they're advocating for is immoral and wrong. 


Thank you for your feedback. :)

10,"&gt; so often I hear people say that if we legalize abortion women will use it as birth control and wont be 'careful' anymore

But that's not the pro-life argument. The pro-life argument isn't ""we're against abortion because we think women will use it as birth control."" Rather, it's ""we're against abortion because it kills a human being unjustly."" 

&gt;So, in response, I might say - that's not true, the choice to have an abortion is difficult and emotional and not something women take lightly

Totally irrelevant. Whether women take it lightly or seriously doesn't matter. Elective abortion is wrong. (And fwiw, some women absolutely take abortion lightly so I would at least qualify your statement if you want it to be true). 

&gt;the choice to have an abortion is difficult and emotional and not something women take lightly, so trust them to make that decision.

And I can't think of any topic quite like abortion, where millions of people are clueless about prenatal development yet hire someone to kill their offspring hundreds of times a day, where half the country finds this completely abhorrent and would be willing to jail those who perpetrate it, yet understand that would both be impractical and unfair to many involved. 

It's on the level of the slave practices in the US, that is one of the only comparable atrocities that comes to mind as far as the tension between social acceptability and rejection, except I'd argue that one involves far more culpability. 

I mean would you rather all women who get abortions get sent to jail? You're making what sounds like a continuum fallacy, wherein because someone hasn't proposed a perfectly logical line to draw between clearly culpable and clearly ignorant, that the proposition that there should even be a line ought to be rejected. Which is kind of ironic since the pro-choice side kind of relies on drawing indistinct lines in pregnancy. 

It's *totally* reasonable to hold more knowledgeable people more accountable for their actions. One way of doing that -- no, not the only way -- is by verifying their level of knowledge through their degree.

28,"&gt; What condition or set of conditions could kill the mother, making an abortion medically necessary?

This is why I've become frustrated in this post: the shift between *could* and *necessary.*  Many conditions could kill a pregnant person.  In fact, people without any risk factors except being pregnant can die from pregnancy.

&gt; These statements are incompatible. The fetus, being that is a human being, is your patient. Most of your pregnant patients are concerned with bringing their unborn child into this world alive, so it is your responsibility to do everything within your power to do that.

They're not incompatible at all!  I care about your well-being, yet you are not my patient.  If I have a patient who wants to reproduce in the future, I care about her fallopian tubes.  If I have a patient who doesn't want to reproduce, I might cut them out.

Like I've said before, yes, I serve my patient's interest by protecting their fetal well-being.  But the fetus is not my patient.

I'm going to be honest, there's a degree to which this is semantic.  I know high-risk OB specialists who are fond of saying, ""we have two patients!"" and others who are fond of saying ""our patient is [the pregnant person], not [the fetus].""  (We will often say ""mom"" and ""baby"" to mean these things in the context of a desired pregnancy.)

29,"""Women feel guilty after having an abortion because they are guilty. They may not have held the knife but they asked for the murder and paid for it and assisted in it.""

I agree with you. But feminists convince them the guilt comes from the patriarchy so they never contemplate it.

The evidence is available, but they don't know to look for it because society represses it for them. It's the same as how members of a cult don't realize they're in a cult, despite all the evidence showing their beliefs are wrong. The indoctrinated are conditioned into their beliefs by the society they're in and that can be very hard to break.

30,"&gt;You've made a significant edit to my statement -- I said I was balancing them, not saying that one trumps the other.

Yeah but in practice one does trump the other. You say you won't induce labor in a 25 week pregnancy. So the woman has no choice but to either abort or wait until term, both of which are things she doesn't want to do with her body and therefore cost her autonomy. So if you won't induce labor, you're putting the importance of not doing harm over the autonomy of the woman.

That's how I see it anyway.",1,1521936511,2018-03-24 20:08:31

33,"&gt; So basically, you think that not doing harm trumps autonomy. (That's what I'm getting from your comment). 

You've made a significant edit to my statement -- I said I was balancing them, not saying that one trumps the other.  After all, requiring a pregnancy to continue also does harm -- to the pregnant person.

&gt; However as you probably know many prochoicers argue that even if the fetus is a person, the woman's autonomy trumps the fetus's life. I take it you disagree with that?

It's not a line of reasoning that I choose to pursue.  When I probe my own feelings on it, I come up with a thought experiment.  Transplant a ten-year-old's head onto a 20-week fetus in utero.  Please ignore the obvious issues in scale and ethics; this set-up has occurred magically.

It's tricky.  I now feel more strongly that I don't want the person to abort -- normally I am neutral on this when counseling my patients.  But I also wouldn't feel right compelling the person to carry the pregnancy to term and deliver.  Let's say there's fetal/10yo distress and it seems she would have to deliver by cesarean or the fetus/10yo will likely die.  Do I consent her for cesarean as though she has a choice in the matter?  I would not cut her open without her permission.

The thought experiment continues, in a wandering way: what if she herself had cast this spell?  Maybe it's a 1% side-effect risk of a get-rich-quick spell.  Then, yeah, I would hold it against her for casting the spell, which is tantamount to manslaughter for the 10yo under the circumstances.  But I still wouldn't force her to have a cesarean.  Surgery isn't a punishment.

These statements are incompatible. The fetus, being that is a human being, *is* your patient. Most of your pregnant patients are concerned with bringing their unborn child into this world alive, so it is your responsibility to do everything within your power to do that. Until the child is born, *you* are its doctor, are you not? When my wife and I went in for her OB visits during both her pregnancies, we discussed her health *and* the baby's. My wife *and* the baby were our reasons for being there and being there so often. Only once the baby is born, do they become the pediatrician's patient.

50,"&gt; autonomy

You're right, it does conflict with my views on autonomy.

When I give examples, I'm generally thinking of a specific patient I've had.  Patients have goals, and I offer them options and help them figure out which one meets those goals.

Your example (25 weeks) has a (somewhat contrived) goal of not being pregnant.

I only have three options to offer:

- Continued gestation with a goal of term delivery.

- Termination and delivery/D&amp;E now.

- Induction, with delivery of a neonate who would be highly likely to have severe disabilities that could have been avoided.

I don't like that third option.  I'm not going to offer it.  I'm balancing nonmaleficence (not doing harmful things) with autonomy (letting patients decide).  I don't see feticide as maleficence when it is requested.

This is my earnest attempt to make my reasoning accessible to somebody who does believe in fetal personhood (which I presume you do).  I know that you disagree with my values and my conclusion, but does the rest make sense?

&gt; the ones born into the Hitler youth and brainwashed as children through adulthood that the Jews are the source of all evil, have less culpability.

Well, I have to disagree. An adult who supported and participated in a genocide is not less culpable just because they were taught Nazi ideology as a child. Likewise ISIS members who kill Christians are not less culpable for murder, even if they are taught that it is right as children. They can plainly see that their victims are human. 

The information is available to abortionists and clients that the unborn are human. It's culturally widespread knowledge - who doesn't know that pregnant women can feel their *baby* kick?

If someone was fully unaware of what pregnancy was for some reason, ok, I believe they aren't culpable. But pro-abortion people usually believe that those humans are not persons, that the mother's bodily autonomy trumps all, etc. This doesn't reduce culpability.

62,"Before going into this, let's remember that less than 1% of abortions are done to save the mother's life. Abortion is nearly always because the mother simply doesn't want to be pregnant and to a lesser extent, because the child has a disability. 

Your argument and the following response only apply to that &lt;1%

&gt; does intent of harm determine whether or not someone is innocent?

It depends. 

1. At one extreme you have a grown person violently shaking, hitting and beating a baby. His intent is to make the baby shut up and stop crying, not to kill or even hurt the baby. But clearly, he is not innocent of murder. 

2. On the other extreme, a hiker is walking on a steep cliff when suddenly the rock crumbles and he falls, striking and killing a person in the valley below. Clearly, this is a tragedy for both people and the hiker is innocent. 

3. In between the extremes lies the realm of people you describe. The mentally ill person who kills because the voices tell him to, the child soldier who shoots down civilians because he's ordered to but also likes it, etc. 

Unborn children whose existence threatens the mother's life solidly fit into the second category, completely innocent. There is no intent at all. 

In that case, every reasonable effort must be made to save both lives.

We don't bypass concern, in fact we show concern for both mother and child equally. Abortion involves a mother violating her child's rights. Pregnancy is never a child violating the mother's rights by murder. In the worst case, the violation is done by child's father in the case of rape. 

&gt;  Is it just for country A to attack and kill those in country B? 

No, but it would be just for A to defend themselves against B invaders, even with lethal force. B is not innocent. Say a man tries to rape a woman. Even if he doesn't try to kill her, the woman is just in killing him to prevent the rape. He is not innocent. However, she is not just in killing a child because the child is innocent. 

&gt; So I would not consider that a gender or a feminist issue, but I do think feminism should be concerned with making a level playing field for all genders in all realms.

You are right about the evil thing. I do not think I got my point across very well here. It is like how when soldiers kill in war is tends to not be considered murder because they have a reason to kill that some people will say is important enough to kill others over. Why might this sometimes be considered just? Like if country A were to be invaded by country B. If country B will not kill anyone from country A, only enslave them, take their land, and overall bring down the quality of life for citizens of country A. Is it just for country A to attack and kill those in country B? 
If that makes any sense, then those are the sort of reasons I am talking about. 

Lastly, I do not really understand your last point. I do think feminism is also about helping men. However, if a group of people needs water, I'm gonna give them water regardless of their gender.

122,"&gt; Isn't this story involving a 14 year old who's body ""wasn't ready to give birth"" a pretty clear cut example?

Only in hindsight.  ""Not ready to give birth"" isn't really a diagnosis.  It's something that's hard to argue with when somebody has died.  It's certainly true that people at extremes of reproductive age (read: young teens and late 40s) are at higher risk of preeclampsia, so that could have been why.  It could be that she had a very small pelvis and she should not have been labored... but here in the US we've moved way away from clinical pelvimetry because we're so often wrong and it leads to unnecessary cesareans.

Does that make sense?

---

&gt; I could also see haemorrhage, infection, or eclampsia being possible life-threatening conditions.

Let us take them in order.

&gt; haemorrhage

This is a broad category.  I'll assume that you mean hemorrhage related to the pregnancy.  Typically this would occur in a miscarriage or after delivery, or as part of a placental abruption that would require emergent delivery or it would result in a fetal demise.

&gt; infection

Of what?

&gt; eclampsia

The vast majority of cases of eclampsia occur at term or post-partum.  It can occur after 20 weeks, so let's stick with this one.

We've reduced the incidence of eclampsia significantly by recognizing and treating preeclampsia.  If somebody has preeclampsia with severe features at 20 weeks, can I offer them an abortion?

If they have severe uncontrolled hypertension with nephrotic syndrome and had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy and are obese (every risk factor for preeclampsia that I can think of at the moment... oh, throw on that they're 48yo, I guess) at 8 weeks' gestation, can I offer them an abortion then?  Or do I have to wait for them to get more kidney damage and have a riskier abortion because of their advanced gestation?

Do you see why these aren't clear-cut?

&gt; What would you consider a life-threatening condition if you were to agree to such an abortion limit?

At what point does this ""clump of cells"" magically turn into something worth living? Since doctors go out of their way to make sure a pre-mature baby stays alive, it's kinda contradictory to me that there are doctors intentionally killing a baby the same age. But I know that's late-term pregnancy and some pro-choice people are just for early-stage pregnancy but to say that when a baby is first conceived that it is a ""clump of cells"" is scientifically inaccurate. We know that the zygote (the earliest stage of human development) is a human being, it is a living organism which has its own unique human DNA. We are all former baby's in the womb and we all deserve the chance to live (I believe).  
A statistic that I would like the other side to know is that only 1% of abortions are as a result of rape, which was surprising to me because that seems to be one of the main arguments to legalise abortion.

I think when I was pro-choice I was mostly drawn in by it being seen as a women's rights issue, but now I see it as the opposite, if a woman feels that she has no other option but to abort, what does that say about our society and government.

No and I will explain why. The terms miscarriage and abortion immediately narrow the subject matter to only ""the loss of a pregnancy"" so it's easier to create a discussion/debate about that topic using those terms. 

Because you can more quickly get everyone on the same topic of debate. And I want to focus only on that.

I also included that while the end results were the same (death) I also included that the situations prior to the ""loss of pregnancy"" were different.

&gt; The ONLY difference: Is whether the expectant mother wants the pregnancy or not. 

---------------------------------

If you use the murder/natural death analogy it becomes difficult as the subject of debate then widens to every life stage. (Infant, toddler, child, teenager and adult.) And it makes the subject matter WAY too broad.

- You could have an argument over abortion vs accidental death
- You could have an argument over mothers who have abortions vs who commit infanticide (Andrea Yates)

Killing innocent human beings is murder. The unborn are innocent human beings. Therefore abortion is murder. 

&gt; What are some pro-life statistics you wish your opponents knew?

How can statistics be pro-life (or anything else)? If you told the Hutus that they killed 800,000 Tutsis in their genocide, they would have said ""great, where's the rest?"" because they were pro-genocide. If we tell our opponents of the 60 million unborn children were killed by abortion, they wouldn't care either because they think it's right. 

&gt; What restrictions on abortion do you think are ideal?

Complete ban. However, it would be legal to treat the mother for severe/life-threatening medical conditions even if treatment risks or ensures the child's death. 

&gt; What are the most ideal restrictions on abortion when restricted to the decisions of the supreme court?

This conversation always makes me think of a patient I had who was 18-22 weeks.  She had a cardiac condition.  Extensive discussion with specialists and analysis of the available data and her current condition gave us an estimate of her chance of dying in childbirth.  I don't remember the exact number, but it was about 35%.  It's rare that we can give a number like that, but there were some very good statistics on her particular condition in pregnancy.

She wanted this pregnancy so badly, she wanted a third child so badly... but after a few days of agonizing, she decided, ""I have to be there for my other children.  I can't do this.""

175,"&gt;I think that you must have missed my point that I don't know where they become substantially higher risk.

I think the level of substantially higher risk would have to be further discussed depending on the law. I imagine there'd be research into outcomes based on risk factors (nothing we are short of) and general guidelines based on those, with wiggle room for clinical disagreement based on the medical professional's judgement and ability to take into account multiple variables for a given patient. 

 &gt;It sounds like this puts you close to being in the 50% camp -- that the risk of death for the pregnant person must be close to 50% in order for abortion to be offered. Is that correct?

176,"&gt; Really, you're not sure? Because, yes, a person with a history of unprovoked DVTs is at higher risk in pregnancy. And a woman who is AMA is higher risk in pregnancy. I could at least intuitively (and with years of experience, more so) rank these if not give them specific quantifiable numbers.

Because you generally reply to me with respect, I think that you must have missed my point that I don't know where they become *substantially* higher risk.

I could also ask, ""what is the lowest-risk person who would be allowed an abortion?"" or ""what is the highest-risk person who wouldn't be allowed an abortion?""

So I repeat my question, how can I do what you want me to be legally required to do?

You approach answering this with a metric when you say:

&gt; Abortion is 100% unsafe for the human being in utero. You would have to show that childbirth runs at least very close to this risk to warrant justifying abortion in the eyes of a pro-lifer, since both lives carry equal value.

It sounds like this puts you close to being in the 50% camp -- that the risk of death for the pregnant person must be close to 50% in order for abortion to be offered.  Is that correct?  (If they had twins, would it have to be close to 66%?)",1,1521866837,2018-03-24 00:47:17
177,"&gt; I take responsibility for my own actions, why shouldn’t everyone else?

Sure, they should!  Their lives are better if they do.  I totally agree that they should.

That said, once we as a society decide that we're not going to let people fall too far, prevention is cheaper than resuscitation.  So if we've decided that we're not going to let infants be hungry and homeless, it makes sense (read: is cheaper) for us to intervene during pregnancy (get pregnant women a home, help stopping using drugs, etc).  Once we're spending money on that, we'll spend *less* money if we also spend money on contraception.

So... maybe I should actually say...

&gt;... “free birth control”. It’s not free. Someone else is having to pay for it.

It's better than free!  It saves you money.  (Or, at least, it saves me money.  I don't know what kind of taxes you pay.)",1,1521866595,2018-03-24 00:43:15
178,"I'm pro-life because abortion kills living human beings. *All* human beings deserve equal rights, not just *convenient* humans. My reasons are non-religious. I was raised in a very liberal pro-choice family. I used to be very pro-choice myself until I realized I knew nothing about abortion and neither did the people ""educating"" me about it. 


I wish people realized that there's no medical need to kill unborn children. If a woman is dying because of complications, it is always going to be permissible to remove the child, whether by inducing labor or emergency c-section. Even if it's too early to live. That's never in question. It's a non-issue that pro-choicers can't seem to let go of. No need to kill the child beforehand though. At least give him a fighting chance. All arguments to the contrary involve being against subjecting women to medical procedures, but abortion and birth already do that. You gotta do one or the other because it has to come out eventually. 


The ideal restriction would be no abortion entirely. The problem is horrible people do horrible things and abortion is a double edged sword. A woman who is raped may initially feel liberated from getting her abortion, but she may also feel re-victimized, and have no one to talk to about regrets because society tells her abortion is justice and anyone who says otherwise is a sexist pig. Abortion also erases the evidence. Then there's fatal anomalies. In a perfect world we wouldn't decide which human beings are worthwhile and which are not. It's not progressive to say that only some lives are worth living, and any that we deem unworthy should be killed, all of this masked under the guise that they are sparing the child from this horrible life. These two things mentioned are extremely rare, though, and my main issue is with elective abortion. If we outlawed elective abortion only, and saved 97% of children who would have been aborted, id consider that a win. 


People generally use the argument that we have no idea what it's like to have to make that decision, but a lot of us do. Some of us have had abortions and regretted it before becoming pro-life . I got pregnant at 17 and decided to keep him. Best thing I ever did. It's been painfully hard and I'm pretty close to being broke at any given moment, but I love my family and my kids love their lives. So we do know what it's like to make the hard decisions, and we feel for every woman who has an unwanted pregnancy. But it's never ok to kill innocent human beings.

185,"&gt; What do you think is a good refute for this?

My refute:

You need to focus on is ""who's reponsible?"". Did you cause the situation? Are you responsible for the other person?

- In the case of blood-transfusion: You DID NOT cause the other person to be in the medical situation that they are in AND the other person isn't solely reliant on you for a blood transfusion.

- In pregnancy (with the exception of incest/rape): You ARE responsible for becoming pregnant (by engaging in sexual intercourse) AND the baby/fetus is solely reliant on you for growth and support.

189,"&gt; Well, wait a second here. The rapist is taking an action to invade your space without your consent. They have no compelling need to inhabit your space, and they are intentionally assaulting you.

That's true, but that's why I brought up the people with kidney failure who do have a compelling need to take up your space. And so you make a good point that the organ at some point in a kidney donation, the organ stops being the donor's and starts being the recipients. I think it's pretty easy to define that line, though; you can revoke consent at any point up until you go unconscious from the anesthesia, at which point we assume that the state of consent is unchanged, and once the organ is removed it cannot be reclaimed. Similarly if we somehow had a way to sustain a uterus containing a baby outside of a human host, and a person decided to donate their uterus to a baby, then the uterus would stop being their uterus as soon as it was removed from their body. However, in the case where the uterus is still contained in your body, you still have the right to withdraw consent for its use, because it is still part of you. 

You're right that it isn't the child's fault that it is there. If we had some way to save the child, I think it would be our moral responsibility to do so. Unfortunately at the moment we don't have artificial uterus technology (or similar). Similarly we don't have artificial kidneys, but that doesn't mean we have the right to take yours to save those who will die without. 

I don't think anyone disagrees that it is wrong to kill human beings; certainly I agree. But I also think that our moral standards show that people have a right to do as they wish with their own bodies, and that no human has a right to another human's body parts, regardless of whether they will die without access to another human's body parts. I guess I'm getting repetitive now, so I'll stop saying this. 

&gt;I mean, it's already 100% fatal for one human. I'm going to have to point out that we can only go so far without recognizing that fact.

No doubt, and I hope that one day medical technology will advance to the point where no human is removed from a uterus and dies as a result. 

&gt;All you're trying to convince me is that it is a better idea to make sure guns are safer so that fewer hitmen die unnecessarily when their shoddy weapon misfires in their face.

I don't think I am doing that, could you explain? 

&gt;Just to be clear, unless you really truly understand that what we are talking about is a living human being who is being killed, the pro-life side may seem like we don't want compromise. The reality is that any compromise that results in the legalized death of an innocent person is no compromise at all.

&gt;The pro-choice side makes many good points, but all of those points are subordinate to the right to life. That doesn't mean that the child is more important than the mother, only that it is considered equal to the mother. And it can seem a hard thing to insist on that, but in the end, it is rarely easy to fight for something really worthwhile. :)

I absolutely agree - the child IS alive, IS human, IS killed, and IS equal to the mother. And equal means that the child, just like any other human, has no right to usurp another human's internal organs without their consent. And that's why I don't understand your (or pro-life) stance - how can you say that giving the child the right to another human's internal organs makes them equal? Or, why AREN'T you arguing that we should be allowed to requisition peoples' kidneys, livers, bone marrow, etc to save people with diseases which could be solved by the sharing of these organs? It just seems so logically inconsistent to me. ",1,1521844970,2018-03-23 18:42:50

191,"&gt; That's how bodily autonomy works. I don't believe that a human fetus should have the right to violate bodily autonomy any more than any other human.

Well, wait a second here.  The rapist is taking an action to invade your space without your consent.  They have no compelling need to inhabit your space, and they are intentionally assaulting you.  

In the case of sex, the mother is consenting to a process which will actually permit an organ into herself which may well deposit sperm.  Indeed, that's the purpose that organ was evolved for.  

The death of a rapist in self-defense is acceptable because they put themselves into your space and in your body through their own volition and violated your rights.

In sex leading to conception, you accepted the action that entered your personal space, and the child has no way of rejecting you as a mother and certainly has no intent of appearing in your uterus at a bad time.  

&gt;In reality, we don't do much to improve mothers' standards of living.

Once could argue that abortion is used as an excuse by both sides for doing less than they should in that regard.  I, for one, would rather spend my energies explaining to someone why supporting mothers is important for society, instead of explaining why it is wrong to kill human beings.  But, things being as they are, first things first.

&gt;In general, our legal system requires the person's consent to use the person's organs to save a different person's life.

The mother consented to the use of her reproductive system for sex.  Its primary function is for the purpose of reproduction.  If she lets someone in there, she can expect that reproduction could occur.  That is far from an unreasonable assumption.   

So, she already consented to use.  What you're suggesting is that she could withdraw consent at any time.  Do you think that once organ donation is made, that the person donating it should have the unrestricted right to ask for it back, even if the other person will die without it and the donating person would not?

&gt;And unfortunately, if it isn't provided legally, people will still access it illegally, which is very dangerous.

I mean, it's already 100% fatal for one human.  I'm going to have to point out that we can only go so far without recognizing that fact.  

Abortion might be legal, but nothing about it is safe.  All you're trying to convince me is that it is a better idea to make sure guns are safer so that fewer hitmen die unnecessarily when their shoddy weapon misfires in their face.  My suggestion for them is to not try and shoot people.  My suggestion for people afraid of unregulated abortions is to not get unregulated abortions.

192,"&gt; If your partner would be killed when you withheld permission to continue with sex, I presume we might view the need for continuous consent a little differently, don't you think?

Right but I'm allowed to defend myself against a person who is in my body without my consent (i.e. a rapist) even if my defense results in their death. That's the comparison I'm making. It's only rape because of the lack of consent. If a rapist holds themselves really tightly to me and the only way I can escape is by killing them, that's allowed. That's how bodily autonomy works. I don't believe that a human fetus should have the right to violate bodily autonomy any more than any other human. 

&gt; we also have many, many ways to improve a woman's standard of living in spite of pregnancy that do not require the child's death.

In reality, we don't do much to improve mothers' standards of living. In fact, I really think we could do better as a society on that front, and I think it would do a lot more to limit abortions than outlawing abortions. That would be great!

&gt;An unborn child is not an organ of the mother.

Obviously. However, the mother's reproductive organs are, obviously, the mother's organs. This is what my argument referred to. I certainly do not think a fetus is an organ of the mother, that's absolutely preposterous and I'm sorry if my wording was confusing. What I meant was, your kidney could be used to save a human life, and the mother's uterus could be used to save a human life. In general, our legal system requires the person's consent to use the person's organs to save a different person's life. It seems to me that this should apply to all organs, uterus and kidney alike. I hope this is more clear.  

&gt; It's nice when we can hedge against consequences

Yeah, and the thing is, we can: we can perform abortions, the technology exists. And unfortunately, if it isn't provided legally, people will still access it illegally, which is very dangerous. And, for reasons I've stated above, and stated in the article, it seems that legalizing abortions actually helps mitigate abortions, and to get pregnant people in connection with the resources they need. 

That's a good point about paternal child support, and I do think that the way we do child support is a bit strange. I haven't really thought about it much though, so I'll avoid putting my foot in my mouth by leaving it there.

193,"&gt;I would argue that consenting to sex and pregnancy is not the same thing. For example, consent has to be ongoing; you can revoke it partway through sex, so why not partway through pregnancy?

If your partner would be killed when you withheld permission to continue with sex, I presume we might view the need for continuous consent a little differently, don't you think?

The problem is you aren't really making a good comparison.  Your partner isn't going to die if you refuse sex.  The child is dead if you try to stop the process after it is conceived.  

&gt;So the mother's life is always at risk

To use a favorite pro-choice word, the mother's life is *potentially* at risk, but abortion on-demand does not require a woman's life to be in imminent danger for her to abort.  She can abort for *any reason whatsoever*.  Most abortions have zero impact on the woman's life.  

An unintended pregnancy *may* have impact on her standard of living, but not only do we not permit people to die for that reason usually, we also have many, many ways to improve a woman's standard of living in spite of pregnancy that do not require the child's death.

&gt;the mother has a right to bodily autonomy, at least as much as you and your kidneys have the right to bodily autonomy.

An unborn child is not an organ of the mother.  A kidney will never have an independent natural existence or develop its own identity outside of our body.  It is an organ, you and I were never an organ of our mother.  

&gt;However, I do maintain that consent is not a ""check yes once and forever stick with your decision"" kind of thing - consent must be freely given and ongoing. 

There are many situations where you must accept the consequences when you enter into a free action.  It's nice when we can hedge against consequences, and you *can* do that a little with sex ed and contraception, but honestly, I don't understand where your position comes from.

Can a father take back his responsibility, for instance, for a child that the woman does decide to carry to term?  Can he just decide, ""whoops, its inconvenient now, so take me off the spousal support list!""  Nope.

196,"No, i agree with you. I was just trying to see what everyone thinks is the best refute to this. 

My problems with this logic is three fold:
1. In one case, a person is dying of natural causes, and you, an unaffiliated individual, should not be required to give up your body to save them. In the case of abortion, if left to natural processes, the baby will live. Abortion is action, the other case in inaction. There is a big moral difference there. 
2. It’s not like if a women felt she didn’t want continue giving up her body for this baby, she could just seperate herself from the baby, leaving the baby’s death to natural causes. That’s not how abortion works. Abortion is usually done, as you said, with drugs and/or dismemberment. Again, abortion is the actionable killing of another human being, wheras a blood transfusion requires inaction and involves a persons dying by natural means. 
3.  This logic, in the end of the day, puts the value of life at viability. This is because if put into practice, only babies which are capably of living autonomously outside of the womb will survive. The problem with viability is it varies by region. A baby may beable to survive outside the womb at 20 weeks in a coastal American hospital. The same may not be said for a child born in rural Alabama, or in 2nd and 3rd world countries around the world, due to the lack in technology. Is a 20 week old child a human being in California, but not in rural Alabama?

I don't think the pro-choice side wants ""freedom from consequences"" as you put it. I think the prochoice side wants to maintain the right to bodily autonomy, which is a human right. For example, you have the liberty to not donate your kidney, but people will die, today, and could be saved if you donated a kidney. So, your liberty is at the cost of a human life right now. Yet I don't see you advocating prolife on that front. To me, it seems therefore logically inconsistent that a human should not have the right to bodily autonomy when it comes to other internal organs which could save another human's life. 

Also, even uncomplicated pregnancy comes with a huge slew of risks, not only medical (including possible death or lasting bodily injuries) but also social and financial (even if the child is put up for adoption, a pregnant person will lose time at work etc). So the mother's life is always at risk, and the mother has a right to bodily autonomy, at least as much as you and your kidneys have the right to bodily autonomy. 

I'm not at all ""suggesting that most pregnancies are nonconsensual."" However, I do maintain that consent is not a ""check yes once and forever stick with your decision"" kind of thing - consent must be freely given and ongoing.

That's self defense, and I don't think anyone disagrees with that.  It is more of the after-the-fact execution that is problematic.  

Certainly, if someone is attacking you, I'm not going to say a peep if they happen to die in the process of assaulting you.  It is more of the premeditated execution after the fact that is more problematic.

&gt;So to me it makes more sense to use that analogy to say that no human has the right to nonconsensually occupy some one else's birth canal,

And I'd again point out that except in the case of rape, the mother did consent to it.  Or she consented to the activity that produced the situation.

I mean, if she does not engage in sex, a child cannot simply appear in her uterus.  So outside of being sexually assaulted, she has control of the process.  She also has the means by which to prevent conception.  Most women in abortion situations are far from powerless even if they are made to feel like they are.

The problem is that it seems like the pro-choice side wants complete freedom from consequences, and I still feel like I wouldn't have a problem with that if that liberty did not also come at the expense of a human life.

While having an unintended pregnancy is not a great situation, no one loses their life over a pregnancy.  At worst, it is a standard of living issue.  That's not small potatoes, but we wouldn't let someone kill another innocent person for that purpose.  The hierarchy of rights must place life itself at the top, even over bodily autonomy, unless the mother is at risk of her own life.  That's really the only viewpoint I can accept as consistent.

My understanding of that statistic was the same as yours:  three or more previous abortions in a lifetime.  

&gt;Furthermore, a person shot by a handgun is usually not a person who was nonconsensually subsisting off of another person's body, so to most people it is more obviously morally wrong to kill that person than the unwanted fetus.

And yet many of those people are gang members in inner cities that are considerably less innocent than the humans killed in abortions and could certainly be argued to be intentionally engaged in risky behavior.  

I would note that that 15,000 number includes many more of those sorts of victims than it does elementary or high school students.  But that does not stop gun control activists from using the full number.

And lest you think I am arguing against gun control, I'm really not.  In fact, my point is that if we consider the lives of so-called ""gangbangers"" to be important enough to stand up for, I don't see why we don't stand up for those who are, by definition, always more innocent than they are.

I've recently been having a long running back and forth with someone who had an abortion because she was raped.  That's frankly a horrible situation to be in.  But I will note, the only person who actually committed a crime in that case is likely still alive and eating three meals a day at the expense of the taxpayer.  

Do I think we should execute rapists?  No.  And with that in mind, I definitely don't think we should be executing their children.

Honestly, there's no good reason to draw the line at personhood that the pro-choice side has, except for the pure purpose of making abortion palatable.  I can't think of any other situation that requires us to make the distinction of person and non-person which isn't used to make an argument to take advantage of another human for some reason.  

&gt;Unfortunately I don't think it is possible to eradicate it any more than it is possible to eradicate rape. Whether it is legal or not, there are always people who will ignore what the law says, and there will always be people willing to perform abortions for a high enough price.

I don't know if we'll eradicate it either, although we certainly won't eradicate it by making it legal.

We did not eradicate slavery around by fighting the Civil War, we did not end murder by making it illegal, and we certainly have not ended suffering by setting up charities to help others.

&gt;Do you think you were making those assumptions? What happens if you stop making them?

I don't know that I am. I think I have a better understanding of the risks and safety of childbirth than most pro-lifers. 

And I think pro-lifers (and human beings in general around any topic they have not dedicated their life's work to studying) make some assumptions which are not false or baseless. It would help if they investigated it more, but from what I can see, they would be correct to say that childbirth is not so dangerous that it warrants murdering innocent human beings hundreds of times a day. Abortion is 100% unsafe for the human being in utero. You would have to show that childbirth runs at least *very close* to this risk to warrant justifying abortion in the eyes of a pro-lifer, since both lives carry equal value. For them to assume that childbirth is not quite up there in terms of risk is for the vast majority of cases accurate. ",1,1521817316,2018-03-23 11:01:56

&gt; So why is income a reason for abortion in your mind?

I think it's a little more complicated than just income.  I think it's really *purpose*.

Have you ever tried to convince a teenager to do something because it's good for them?  It's tough.  What makes it easier is if they have a sense of purpose.

I make a lot of small talk with my patients.  For the middle and high schoolers, I'll ask them what their favorite subject is in school, what they do for fun, and what they want to be when they grow up.  If they have a favorite subject, if they do something for fun that isn't just ""hang out with friends,"" and they know what they want to do in life... they're going to want contraception.

If they don't, they're going to say, ""oh, I won't need that,"" or ""condoms,"" or ""I'll be more careful.""  They're more likely to decline the Gardisil vaccine, too.

This applies across a lot of things, it's not just teens and contraception.  My older patients?  Sometimes their purpose is their children.  Much easier to motivate them to take care of their health.

It's not always income.  It's more... an ingrained sense of the potential for upward mobility.  Children of immigrants tend not to have this problem as much.

246,"&gt; But the assessment of clinical risk is still something all physicians are tasked with, whether abortion hangs in the balance or not.

I've seen a lot of high-risk pregnancies.  Let's take my views on choice out of it.  Let's say you gave me a list of all the pregnancies I've seen in the last four years and told me, ""please mark all of the ones at substantially higher risk.  We'll give you $5 for each one you mark.  But if you seem to be using it frivolously, we'll take it all away.""  There are plenty who I know I could mark and could defend if you threatened to take away my money.  There are plenty who I know I couldn't defend marking.

But there are also plenty for whom I'd think, ""gee, I don't know.""

Somebody who needs to deliver by cesarean?  If you were having a discussion about reducing the cesarean rate and said, ""well, does cesarean have a substantially higher risk of maternal death than vaginal delivery?"" most would say, ""yes!  That's why we need to reduce the rate of cesareans!""

Somebody with a history of postpartum depression and suicide attempts?

Somebody with a BMI of 50?  40?  35?

History of DVTs?  Provoked DVTs?  Unprovoked DVTs?  History of pulmonary embolism?

I'm genuinely unsure.  And, since I'm more than a little pro-choice, this scale only has weight on one side for me.  How can I do what you want me to be legally required to do?

Yes, I think I see what you're saying: that an absolute risk seems far more relevant than a relative increase in risk when deciding whether abortion is acceptable or not. 

And that does make sense. If 90% of women had a 98% chance of dying in childbirth, abortion would probably be way more acceptable. 

It seems pro-lifers make a subconscious assumption of what a typical risk level of childbirth is and then another subconscious assumption about what *threshold* the ""increased risk"" would surpass to constitute acceptable abortion. 

&gt;The idea that it's up to me what risk of death is ""not high enough"" for a patient, rather than up to my patient... that's abhorrent to me.

On the other hand...

&gt; Right, that's the point I was trying to make. They must be referencing some level above typical childbirth risk, otherwise all abortion would be legal under that kind of law. 

&gt; Because an increase in risk is a lot more clear than what constitutes a ""substantial"" risk. 

This is the reasoning that I find strange.

You have inside of you a sense of ""at this amount of risk of death, I would be okay with it being legal for somebody to have an abortion.""  Let's call it X.  Now let's say the average risk of maternal mortality in the US rises by Y.  Would your X also rise by Y?

Surely your X is independent of what the ""typical"" risk is.

Do you see why I find it strange?  I have doubts that I'm expressing it well.

---

&gt; Just because it isn't precisely quantifiable doesn't mean there's no way to know. You just use clinical risk factors. Physicians make statements all the time about significant or non-significant risk based on their understanding of a disease process. The law would essentially put that judgement into their hands. 

I'm not saying there's no way to know, I'm saying that it's subjective.  The idea that it's up to *me* what risk of death is ""not high enough"" for a patient, rather than up to my patient... that's abhorrent to me.

268,"I mean, realistically, the reason for the decrease in the number of abortions isn't people going to abortion facilities, it is the funding of organizations who provide that information which often happens to be organizations that also tend to be pro-abortion.  

So certainly, there might be an effect where an uneducated person might become educated by appearing in front of a real medical professional for their abortion, but that's like relying on the cops instructing you on the dangers of drinking and driving after you have already killed someone in a crash.  By then, it's already too late for someone else's life.

Sure, discomfort of the procedure will probably cause most to be more inclined to do what it takes to avoid abortion in the future, but clearly this does not stop everyone.  

At the very least, there will always be a bedrock group of women who will get an abortion because (a) it is their first time pregnant unintentionally, or (b) their previous abortions were not significantly uncomfortable enough for them to avoid it in the future.

Remember the number I mentioned for those who have three of more abortions per year?  That smaller 8.6% number of 56,000 or so is around three times the number of handgun deaths in the United States last year (15,549).  

So, even if through some miracle 600,000 legalized abortions per year were able to actually reduce to that low number, it would remain more prevalent than a cause of death that most people consider to be an epidemic worthy of protests and legislation.

Further, while we may have reduced the rate of abortion from its high, the actual rate of abortion (14.3/1000) is only now starting to dip below the rate in 1973 (16.3/1000), after a high of 29.3 per thousand in 1981.  

In short, any victory in that regard over the abortion rate is merely after the incredible inflation of the practice after it was made legal.  Not a particularly high bar to meet.  We probably could have gotten to 14.3 per thousand by simply improving education and birth control in 1973.  

That's honestly why I can't take the argument seriously that funding abortion clinics and keeping abortion legal is actually helping.  At best it has reached where it was 40 years ago, and it is never going to ensure the eradication of the practice.

We in medicine like putting ourselves out of business.  In OB/gyn, we do the delivery, and then we encourage postpartum contraception.  We do the pap smears, and we hand out the Gardisil vaccines.  We put in retropubic slings, and we teach people how to do Kegel exercises.

345,"Not sure why murdered is in quotes there.

&gt;Despite her friends and family’s pleadings, a Catholic Irish mother recently trekked to England to abort her unborn baby.

&gt;According to a Metro.co.uk report Tuesday, her baby was diagnosed with a fatal fetal disability after only a few weeks gestation. She chose to have an abortion in England, because abortion is illegal in Ireland. She made the journey with the help of Mara Clarke, the Abortion Support Network founder (pictured above).

Tough case, granted.

&gt;Clarke, whose Abortion Support Network has funded the deaths of 1,009 unborn babies in 2017, said she doesn’t believe that repealing the 8th Amendment is enough.

&gt;“Repealing the 8th Amendment is just one step. There’s still going to be a number of issues that will make it incredibly difficult for women to access abortions. They are talking about only allowing abortions up to 12 weeks and only if there is a risk to life.”

&gt;Clarke lamented that the “stigma attached to abortions” prevents “many people even asking for help.”

&gt;“Some of the women we talk to change their minds, some of them just aren’t able to make the trip in the end,” she added. “That truly haunts me.”

""We must remove the stigma"" basically. What haunts her is the fact that women *change their minds and don't get an abortion.*

This is what you're up against.",1,1521733625,2018-03-22 11:47:05
346,"While it is certainly not the majority, a substantial number of abortions are performed on people who have had them before.

&gt;Women with one or more previous induced abortions accounted for 44.9% of abortions, and women with no previous abortion accounted for 55.1%. Women with three or more previous births accounted for 13.8% of abortions, and women with three or more previous abortions accounted for 8.6% of abortions.

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6624a1.htm

Bear in mind that in 2014 the CDC counted 652,639 abortions, although not all states and areas report to the CDC, so it is probably higher.

For those who have had *three or more* the 8.6% of that total number is about 56,127.  

Although there is no way to be sure, I think it is safe to assume that these folks are only having one abortion per year, so that is the number of subjects.

I'd also point out that, ""abortions"" may also include drug-induced in that number, and I am not certain of the pain level of that.  Certainly it would be less invasive than suction or a D and C.  

Now, if a woman has gotten at least one, and sometimes more than three abortions, presumably they could also obtain birth control, or at least understand the usage of a condom.  

Again, my supposition isn't that they consider abortions fun or easier than birth control.  It is that in many cases, they take few precautions and they end up right back in the abortion center.  The reason for their actions may be lack of education, but it is odd that they're familiar with how to get an abortion, but not so much on how to prevent pregnancies in the first place.  

Perhaps it is painful and distressing, but repeat performances, so to speak, do not appear to be rare.

It is merely a term for a stage of development for a human.  We all went through it, every one of us.  

You're certainly presenting real problems.  No one doubts that pregnancy taxes the human body a great deal.  But, your perception of mothers in this situation as being used as ""aminals"" is merely a symptom of society's low regard for life when it can't sit on a picket line and speak for itself.

It's a nonsense argument of course. You can hold both positions to various degrees, qualified and contextualized to suit; but the argument is psychologically persuasive in its punchy form.

I'm saying that even if the fetal human *is not currently a person*, legally or philosophically speaking, you're still depriving a future person from something that is theirs. As a weak analogy, if there's a sweepstakes with a $100,000 cash prize, but someone broke into  the sweepstakes office and stole the prize money, the person who would have won (even though they're not declared the winner yet) is out $100,000.

413,"92% of abortions occur in the first 13 weeks. The others occur mostly in cases of rape or danger to the mother. A fetus' -  potential for life and viability will never equal the real experience, the real trauma, real pain of a person whose body happens to possess the ability to birth a human being after a very painful long expensive process. An organism the size of a spoon has potential, sure, but in cases of unwanted pregnancies, this potential will ALWAYS come at the price of extreme psychological trauma and changes that'll stay with your body forever (I can only speak on my experiences, but being forced to create and painfully birth against your will like an animal is TRAUMATIZING, so much more the rape that made me pregnant against my will in the first place. I wasn't pregnant for very long but I still have pains and symptoms that have changed my life and body forever. I can't even imagine the physical/psychological trauma that comes from pregnancy-related complications that many people have). We need to respect the pregnant people enough to make their own decisions because at the end of the day, you're asking them to live months of trauma and a lifetime of traumatic memories for what is, in more than 90% of cases, something small enough to fit into a spoon that has potential, but potential for life is not equal to the real life and real trauma of an actual person (not a fetus).",1,1521668999,2018-03-21 17:49:59

I would assume that legal abortion providers are also legal health care providers, and can make people aware of other options available to them. Where an illegal abortion place would likely just take your money and do the thing, a legal place would at least let you know about alternative options, and so people who were feeling like abortion was the only option might instead realize there is support available to them should they choose to continue the pregnancy.

The rapist in your case is who made you suicidal, or at least, provided the act that set off that state of mind.  

Is he going to be executed?  While some states might do that, I'd guess the answer is no.

I'm not going to sit here and pretend I have all the answers for how to deal with the trauma of your situation, and I certainly don't have hard words for you in your situation.  I can heartily empathize with what happened.

But if killing an innocent human being is wrong for anything other than self-defense, then we cannot relax that understanding even for the more extreme situations.  We need to find a better way of handling this as a society.  And the longer we accept killing as the solution to our problems, the longer it will take to actually make those advances.

423,"One needs to ask themselves why the mere legalization of abortion would reduce the number.  In what way can this even make sense?

Abortions are performed when someone perceives that they ""need"" to get one, or perhaps that they just have a preference to use it as birth control.

In the first case, the ""need"" to get an abortion for unintended pregnancy is not modified by its legality.  

The most likely situation is that abortion ""services"" also come with birth control, and other sex ed. facilities which can help reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy.  These can certainly reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy, and hence abortions, but those services can all be provided for women when abortion is illegal as well.  

In the second case, it is hard to see how making abortion convenient and legal now makes it less appealing to those who use it as a form of primary or backup birth control.  After all, if legal abortions are made inconvenient for them, they haven't really lost the option of using unlicensed or unregulated practitioners as they would have in the past. 

So I'd chalk up the reduction to either the better availability of sex ed or birth control, or perhaps even a factor such as the simple reduction of the pro-choice population by dint of a generation of aborting unwanted children.  ",1,1521662341,2018-03-21 15:59:01

If this had been a self-defense situation, it would be a balancing of life vs. life, but here, this is a consideration of a death to maintain a standard of living, not protect someone's actual life.

Here's the thing. You're stating your opinion and I get it. But I am asking you to explain it or back it up. I am asking why is removing objects from your body any morally different than compelling someone to use their body in a way that they do not want to?

And just as a side note, legally you can not remove things from or put things into your body at will. Some examples are harvesting one's own organs or injecting illegal drugs into yourself. Both illegal.
 
&gt;For example I can't murder someone by stabbing them. I can however remove a wart on my skin with a knife.

I don't think these examples explain the reasoning behind your ideology. The reason you can not murder someone is because that would be infringing on their right to life (which is the case with abortion). The reason you can remove the wart is because it is not harming anyone (which is not the case with abortion).

&gt;An abortion, to me, is simply removing something from yourself that you wish wasn't there.

Again, we go back to the conjoined twins example. Can the brother decide (in the scenario I described above) to slice, tear and pry his sibling off of himself leaving her dead? Isn't that infringing on her bodily autonomy?
 
&gt;Yes I know, abortion involves the murder of a child. But instead of doing that, why not remove the child from a uterus and allow it to die on its own?

Because pushing a child into an environment that is not conducive to their survival is considered killing in every other situation. Why is leaving a child to drown in a pool or out in the cold to freeze any different than leaving a born child to die afterbirth? 

And as mentioned before, this could only happen with a late term abortion. Earlier abortion necessitate that the preborn child is killed in utero before exiting the birth canal.

&gt;As for the conjoined twin issue, I feel the same way. Find out which person owns what parts, and if either of them wishes to separate, they should be allowed to regardless of what happens to the other.

Why do they need to know who owns which parts? There will never be a way to separate without infringing on the other person's body. And again, my example had nothing to do with separation. 

I'm not sure if you are being wilfully obtuse or you really do not get me questions.

Throwing a child into the river is an act of violence against a child. Abortion is the termination of pregnancy in that you are saying you will not allow someone else to use your blood against your will. Sure, a child dies in the process, but the initial act is preserving you're right to bodily autonomy over the right of someone else's bodily autonomy. 

Your right to your organs and blood takes absolute priority over another person. Nobody should be allowed to use your organs and blood against your will. This is different than throwing a child out a boat for obvious reasons (to me).

Because sometimes people would be pregnant and would not want to be pregnant.

All induced abortions are elective.  Abortions are, broadly speaker, safer than carrying to term and delivering.  I am not prepared to require a stranger to take the increased risk of carrying a pregnancy to term.  Remember that you and I have different views on fetal personhood.

94,"&gt; Kill his sister? No that's murder. He should however be allowed to separate himself from his sister. If this results in the sister dying, that is not murder. That is just the sister dying on her own. It is nobody's fault that she died. Technically, it's her own body's fault, she wasn't capable of living on her own and therefor she died a natural death.

Really? So a father leaves his newborn daughter out in the cold. She freezes to death. By your logic, it's not his fault because she was incapable of surviving on her own. Here's another, a man tosses a kid who can't swim over the side of his boat. He dies of asphyxiation because he can not survive in the water. 

Not to mention that abortion kills the child before they exit the birth canal via poisoning, chemical burning and/or tearing apart. An aborted child is not simply evacuated from the womb. There is a difference between abortion and induction.
 
&gt; I do not lump feeding a newborn with giving a fetus the right to stay in your uterus. I agree you should be charged for murder if you have taken your child home after birth and then starved it. I don't believe you should not be charged with murder for removing a child from your organs, even if it leads to that baby's death.

I realize you don't. The point is that from a logically point of view the two things are no different. 

&gt; The former situation requires you to perform actions after you have willingly taken a child into your care. The latter is a basic human right for someone who owns an organ.

And many argue that when you have consensual sex you have willing taken on the risk of ending up with another human being in you. But if it helps, imagine a situation where the mother does not want the child. She gives birth and leaves the child to die. She would also be charged with negligence homocide at best, first degree murder at worst.

&gt; They are two completely different things and should be discussed separately.

I'm going to assume you don't mean the first half of my comment.  ;)

&gt; Do you think the problems you brought up are insurmountable?

Yes, I do.

&gt; Because it seems like shifting the focus on to risk assessment for the fetus wouldn't be too difficult.

I'd like to question your premise.  Most of the time, I need to remind my patients that it is reasonable to take on a small amount of fetal risk if it means significantly reducing maternal risk (for example, delivering cephalic/breech twins vaginally rather than by cesarean).  The focus already includes risk assessment for the fetus.  It's my job to help my patient achieve their goals, and one of those is (on L&amp;D), delivery of a healthy baby.

So do you mean instead that, in pregnancy, people would lose the ability to consent to and decline medical treatment, and instead somebody (who?) would advocate on behalf of the fetus to determine what was and was not appropriate treatment?

---

&gt; I think you know that no one here is saying that their body isn't their own

Neither am I saying that you are saying that.

&gt; but that they have a responsibility to the separate body growing inside them. If we make an exception here, it begs the question why we have murder laws in the first place, if it always comes down to people being able to do whatever they want whenever they want without consequence, like smoking and drinking while pregnant (there should always be consequences for that.)

I think that we need to abandon this thread of argument.  My views on fetal personhood and morality are so dissimilar to yours that I have fundamental disagreements with the above paragraph on every level (including how you combine periods and parentheses; in the above context it should be done like this).  (However, an entirely parenthetical sentence can be rendered like this.)

I'm willing to elaborate if you're willing to approach it in a spirit of curiosity.

&gt; Do you think that if we created a culture where motherhood was praised more for the sacrifice that it is, and the government took a more active role in providing resources and support for people who might struggle with it, we could finally outlaw abortion?

""How can I destroy you?"" you ask me?  I am happy to answer.  I try to destroy myself too.

Two things to do:

For people for whom motherhood is not appreciated, give them support.  Celebrate women like the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who just announced her pregnancy while in-office.  (Feel free to post that to /r/prolife!  Credit me.)  She will be taking a brief leave when she delivers, then her husband will stay at home with the baby while she returns to leading the country.

Mandatory maternal leave (with a use-it-or-lose-it *paternal* component), free healthcare during pregnancy, free childcare... these are all things that will make people feel like they have more of a choice.  I want that!  Whenever I have a patient telling me they feel they don't have a choice, I stop and talk about how they do have a choice.  (On any subject, really.)

The second thing, though, is that it's not enough to try and target just pregnant women.  Poverty is a serious medical condition, and treating the consequences of it (like poor social support, homelessness, or not being in a position to negotiate time to pump breastmilk at work) will always be more difficult than treating the root cause.  End income inequality.  Tax the rich and funnel the money to the poor.  I don't care how you do it -- massive government-works projects, pointless ditch-digging, cash hand-outs... money flows up in an economy.

I could have free healthcare and six weeks' sick leave for every pregnant patient, and if their partner, their parents, and their siblings are all unemployed and living hand-to-mouth, they still will say it's not the right time for them.

If you want my patients to stop showing up to the clinic saying they don't have a choice, that's what would change it.

(Plus comprehensive sex ed, free access to LARCs, and while we're at it, let's get a male LARC sorted out.  Also I want a yacht.  Trust me, my having a yacht is an important part of the process.  Let me know when you have it ready.)",1,1516658989,2018-01-22 17:09:49

No, that analogy doesn't really work, as most people wouldn't qualify for welfare.

102,"&gt; Do you think that if we created a culture where motherhood was praised more for the sacrifice that it is, and the government took a more active role in providing resources and support for people who might struggle with it, we could finally outlaw abortion?

There would be no need to outlaw abortion in that case, as almost no one would seek it out. Those policies would completely eliminate the abortions sought by women who desperately want the baby but can't afford it, or whose families shame them for their sexual sins, or for women abandoned by their partners. 

The only ones left to abort would be those who were raped and psychologically need to rid themselves of the demon-seed of the rapist (and that's a relatively tiny number) and the women whose babies have physical anomalies that are so grave the child wouldn't survive--or might cause maternal injury or death (again, relatively small numbers). 

Most abortions now come from women who are financially or socially unable to continue a pregnancy. I'd really love to see the conservative movement really turn toward helping those women rather than trying to control them via the law. Isn't it always better to use incentives rather than punishments to effect social change?

116,"&gt; I watched an old episode of ER where a mom no longer wanted to have her baby so she basically withheld treatments and let the full term baby die. There was nothing they could do about it. That's not right

First, let me say that I've been in situations where patients declined treatment that I felt was in the best interest of them and their fetus, ranging from minor (TDAP shot at 28 weeks) to major (delivery of compromised fetuses).  I have experienced the frustration firsthand.

There is no force that could compel me to operate on a patient who has capacity and does not consent.  I would act to discredit, censure, ostracize, undermine, and strip the license from any doctor I knew who did otherwise.  I feel confidence that my colleagues would do the same to me, and am glad of it.  Autonomy is one of the four tenets of medical ethics, and we are all better off for it.

I invite you to suggest the law that you have in mind, that would let the doctors from *ER* strap the woman down (tase her? medically sedate her? wrestle her?) and treat her (operate on her? vaginally examine her?) against her will.  I am confident that there is no way to write that law that won't result in violations of autonomy that (I hope) you would find intolerable.

&gt; Women ARE charged for neglect in cases where babies are born addicted to drugs.

This varies from state to state.

I invite you to read:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5151516/

If a child was born with congenital Listeria, and the mother admitted to eating deli meat, would you support her prosecution?  What is substantially different between that and a congenital cocaine baby?  I would argue that the substantial differences do more to exonerate the cocaine user, as cocaine is more addicting than cold cuts.

I think that the only reason that the states with absurd laws or precedents on the books (I'm looking at you, South Carolina) haven't spiraled out of control is that prosecutors are only applying them to cases where we already see a moral crime as taking place.  We have sympathy for the cold cuts Listeria mom, or the mom who didn't take anticoagulation during pregnancy even though she was advised it would reduce her risk of miscarriage.  We don't have sympathy for drug users.

(""We"" here is used broadly.  I've got tons of sympathy for them.  Perhaps you do too.)

So that's argument one: ""first they came for cocaine addicts, then they came for deli meat eaters...""

131,"Yeah, I am not sure he hit the headline question on the nose.

Our author is a Jesuit, and quoting the Bible, so I will introduce some religious argumentation in here where I would usually avoid it.

The takeaway from the article is that in the abortion debate, ""winning"" is less important than what I would call ""witness"".  That is to say that we not here to win ""at all costs"".  

We cannot accept legalized abortion because having it indicts all of society in the practice, even if we personally decide not to permit the procedure.  

There is a strong push to not only improve access to abortions, but also have them paid for out of the taxpayer's pocket, as well as promotion of the practice as we have seen with the California and other initiatives that attempted to require presentation of that option by law.  In short, that all means that tolerance cannot be permitted of the practice of legalized abortion.  Numbers may fluctuate, but it will never reach zero.

Having said that, there seems to sometimes be an idea that we must ""win"".  From a religious perspective, even a child who is the victim of an abortion can have a good end, in the hands of the Creator.  

So, we need to understand that if we must step over the line to win, then we must accept temporary defeat to avoid that.  We must pull up the field and replant it in better ground.

A recent example is our current President.  I don't particularly like him, and I don't really think he's doing a particularly good job in office.  

What he has done, however, is seeming to take a strong pro-life position.  While I believe that this is merely him pandering to us, many of whom are considered part of the conservative base, I cannot argue that getting a better Supreme Court justice pick and better regulations in place isn't hurting our cause.

Nevertheless, if it is found that he has actually done criminal acts (and I am not saying he has) or if he leads the USA on a path that is morally reckless, then we may need to step back and choose a new candidate, even if that candidate may lose to the other side.  

I'm not an Impeach Trump person.  And I actually have seen nothing but fevered hopes from the other side that he can somehow be dislodged before his term is up, but I can also say that I wouldn't be surprised if he was caught doing something wrong.  

If he is caught doing something that is truly reprehensible, then I think we would need to assess our moral responsibility and perhaps choose another path forward, even if it is a temporary step backward.

So, to love our enemies, I think it means that we must consider their welfare as much as that of unborn children in the overall scheme of things.  If the result of fighting a single minded battle for the end of legal abortion is, for instance, a leader intent on  foreign war, criminal activity or tyranny, then we need to step back from that line.  If all doubt is dispelled about those intentions, we need to understand that our fellow citizens are people too, and they deserve our concern.

The reason these types of people see reproductive rights as human rights is that they see women has having less reproductive rights than a man and they want women to have the same (lack) of responsibilities when it comes to reproduction as a man.  In other words, they really see the female human body as being ""less"" than a man's.  They get all ""but!but!but!"" when you point that out to them, but it really is the way they view the world - women are less than men and the only way to be equal to a man is to be able to not have your biology dictate what happens to...your biology.   Instead, using medical technology, they believe, you can make your body have the same responsibility as a man's.

Instead, women and men should be seen as ""equal in dignity but different in function"" when it comes to biology especially.  Life is a gift!   Women should celebrate that they can hold another life inside of themselves and literally feed another human with their very bodies.

There's also one documented case of pregnancy from oral sex -- it involved getting stabbed in the stomach and the sperm made it down to the egg.

Finally, and more notably, about 0.5% of pregnancies in the US occur in people who claim never to have had intercourse.

&gt; Women are free to make all the choices in the World before they get pregnant, but after they ALLOW another life to form in their body, their body is no longer their own. They shouldn't be allowed to kill their unborn any more than any other parent is allowed to kill their offspring. 

Legally, there are a lot of ways this idea would affect healthcare that go beyond abortion rights.  There are a lot of decisions about the management of pregnancy that the pregnant person gets to make, not the fetus and also not anybody acting on behalf of the fetus (other than the pregnant person).

Decisions like whether to deliver vaginally or by cesarean.  What kind of prenatal testing to get.  When to deliver.  Whether or not to stay inpatient for monitoring in certain settings.  Whether or not to get invasive procedures or testing.

Whether or not to eat swordfish, brie, or deli meats.  Whether or not to smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, or smoke cigarettes.  Whether or not to sit in hot tubs.

However, we must not think that pro-choice people are supporting abortion because they *want* to kill babies. Pro-choice people often believe that the unborn are not truly ""persons"" because they lack the ability to cognate without their mother, etc. They aren't waking up in the morning and asking themselves, ""How can I kill as many innocent babies as possible today?""

I understand that you may be posting some parts of this just to vent, but remember that this is a public forum. No one is going to open their hearts and minds to other's views when they are being called ""child killers"" and ""murderers"". Even if no other pro-choice person ever reads this, other pro-life people might read it and think it is an acceptable way to speak about people on the other side of this issue. No one wins when we fail to give mutual respect one another.

You may want to check out the Equal Rights Institute blog. They talk about the right way to speak with pro-choice people in order to make connections and have rewarding discussions.

""Anti-discrimination:"" I've never really seen someone describe themselves or a group they're part of in this way.

""Anti-smoking:"" In my experience, I haven't heard this refer to people, only specific laws. A quick Google search does reveal an anti-smoking.org site as the top hit, but it looks like it came straight out of 90s web design. I think the largest group that's currently fighting tobacco is The Truth; a quick look at their site didn't result in any uses of the term ""anti-smoking."" Like with ""anti-discrimination,"" a bunch of these groups are named things like ""Lung Association,"" ""Heart Association,"" etc.

308,"&gt;So like I said before, there are reason, I personally feel that the mother has full responsibility for the fetus, which includes the ability to abort it, I don't look at a fetus and think its a person, I don't feel bad when someone gets an abortion like I do when someone's child dies, I can't imagine telling a pregnant woman that she isn't allowed to do what she thinks is best for her. But those aren't logical arguments, those are just emotional arguments because its an emotional issues, not a logical one. 

You are right when you say it isnt a logical one. And I'm confused since at the beginning of our conversation here you said you had plenty of valid arguments as to why you came to the pro-choice conclusion. I don't find your ""morality is subjective"" line of thinking to be the case here.

&gt;Even though you don't like the analogy, its like my trying to logically explain why vanilla is better than chocolate, if you have disagree, then no amount of logic is going to make you say that you actually like vanilla better. Now I can say why I like vanilla better, I can logically say that you like something similar to vanilla ice cream so you should like vanilla ice cream, but there is no logical conclusion, it is emotional and purely subjective.

Again: reasons for policy changed. I've actually had a conversation with a pro-choicer recently, and while I do not find her views on personhood to align with the morals I live by, I find her arguments much more convincing than this one. Subjective taste, subjective morals- I think you mean subjective to different individuals, but I'm not impressed by your views on pedophilia and terrorism. So it's wrong to *you*, and you would protest up against it, but if your ideals don't go through, too bad? I guess it is not universally wrong. Which, frankly, is just like saying 2+2=4 is a subjective view. Some things are universally wrong, and its not up to others to decide that raping a child is not wrong.

&gt;I personally think they should have the rights, like i said, I think it would help them, and I would personally feel better about it. It depends what the will of the people actually is, to the extent that they do agree with the constitution, if the constitution denies women's rights and people really want women's rights then I would say they probably don't agree with their constitution, similar to slavery in the US, it required an amendment, because people disagreed with the constitution.

You're back-pedaling. First you said constitution is the ultimate morality, even overruling the people, now you're saying that it depends on the will of the people. I don't have a problem with that, but it seems like you were somehow unaware of anything I said there and just said this to make a point. And you've already said we should go by the will of the people no matter what, so you have no room to talk on moral rights and wrongs. The majority seem to want women to have rights, I'll give you that. But it's not the only Muslim country out there, and plenty of the others have these kinds of views: http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/



&gt;If California wanted to allow infanticide, it would be against the constitution as a baby is a citizen, and I think it makes sense that the state won't let you kill its citizens. But like I said, there are tribes that do that, and I can't say it really bothers me that much.

I doubt they would allow newborns to become citizens to make the process easier. 

&gt;I tolerate it as much as you do, unless you go over there and protest for women's rights. And that isn't correct, I said that I can find something so objectionable that I would want to make a law against it. Basically when you say something is morally wrong, I am saying that I really really don't like it, and would take action to stop it from happening.

The fact remains that you think it is acceptable in their terms, and by saying that there are no absolutes at all, even when that thinking can harm another, and that they can be right and wrong at the same time. 

&gt;I feel like you are confusing amorality with not having an opinion, just because I don't think there is a universal morality, doesn't mean that I am neutral about everything. 

[Actually, it does](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amoral). By definition if you are amoral you lack a sense of moral right and wrong.

&gt;I, like you, find child rape abhorrent, so abhorrent, that I would advocate for laws against it and to punish those who do it. Because I do not want to live in a world with where people do that.

You still haven't explained what rights you have to stomp on their freedoms. If morality is subjective, then finding pedophilia disgusting is merely a point of view. And they may have different points of view.

&gt;You would think that, but some tribes have been doing it for centuries, or milenia. 

Good for them. Maybe they can tell victims of child neglect, that abandoning their helpless child to die in a field, that child neglect is fine. Maybe they can tell doctors, who have researched the whole thing and found [several problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288037/) with it, that child neglect is fine. 

&gt;Maybe they think male circumcision is barbaric.

What does this have to do with anything? I have not once said I support circumcision(I don't) for either of the two sexes.

&gt;Reality is't subjective, but you're autonomy wasn't violated from the perspective of someone who didn't think you had it in the first place.

That's their point of view. You'd be just as human as they are, and unless you violated another human being(killing, raping), they would have no justification for taking your autonomy. 

&gt;*And keep in mind that if you say, ""We as a society decided that treating a person badly based on their [ommitted] is wrong"" - this is not an answer as to why we shouldn't be allowed to treat someone badly based on biological aspects of their humanity. What reason is there to limit this freedom?*

Yes, it's a comment from earlier, but it applies just as much here.

&gt;From what I can tell I think the main difference is that am saying that there is no universal morality, but that I am perfectly fine imposing my own morality/beliefs/judgments on others if I feel that strongly about them. I get the idea that you don't want to impose your beliefs on others, so you say that they are universal morals, that just happen to align with your beliefs, and you are fine with imposing those on other people. I feel like your universal morals are the same thing as my very strong beliefs.

I don't think so. My morals are based off of objective rights and wrongs. Kant's philosophy is duty maxim(""act as if you were through your maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends), universalizability of ones actions maxim(act only in such a way that you can at the same time will it to be universal law), and the intrinsic value of personhood and existence maxim(treat your fellow human being as an end and not merely a means to an end). I think this assures that all people have the same rights as others, without violating anyone's rights.",1,1516470282,2018-01-20 12:44:42

311,"&gt;If I were to make a comment about why abortion is wrong, it would be a lot longer...but that wasn't the goal of the comment. 

I merely went by your comment, ""But what finally made me pro-life was I started to imagine the suffering of children who were being killed..."" and the rest that followed. Since we've already established that zygotes and young fetuses can't suffer, it seems your motives are grounded in false assumptions. 

&gt;Your reasoning is faulty because it relies on the assumption that all living organisms are equal.

Actually, it does not. All sentient beings should be given the same right to life, despite our minor differences. 

&gt;We give special distinction to human beings because they are conscious, self-aware, capable of rational thought

Animals have those qualities, in addition to feeling pain and having the desire to live. 

Again, your assumptions have led you down the wrong path. 


&gt; You may try to argue that a fetus isn't conscious, self-aware, or capable of rational thought, 

We've established that as fact, not opinion. 

&gt;but they simply have to belong to that species to be awarded the protections given to all human beings, which is the right to life. 

That makes no sense at all. Would a vile of human stem cells be given more protection than am adult dog or chimpanzee? No, they wouldn't. 

&gt; A human organism, which is a genetically unique human being by definition, always has the right to life. 

Strands of DNA can create a human being, just as a zygote can become a human being given the right conditions. Neither are sentient, conscious human beings and have no rights that suoerseed their host. The adult woman carrying a not-yet-conscious zygote has every right to terminate her pregnancy. 

&gt; I would never tell a woman what she should do with her body, but I would tell someone what to do with someone else's body. 

A zygote or young fetus is NOT a body... Would you consider a ball of dough to be bread? 

&gt;Bodily autonomy always ends, as with every law, where another body begins.

Buy you define ""body"" at just a few cells, which is convenient for you, but has no rational reasoning. 

I will agree that late term abortions should be discouraged, because at that point the fetus is developed enough to have the capacity to experience pain. 

&gt;I always find it strange how there are so many mental gymnastics required to justify killing tiny human beings, when it's so simple to explain why it's wrong. 

And yet, you rationalize killing and eating fully sentient beings. 

The explanations I hear about why abortion is wrong are nearly always founded on faulty reasoning, emotions, religious beliefs, and a keen of scientific understanding. Having a strong opinion is not a substitute for facts.

BUT. I also think birth control can create a false sense of security, especially for teens. A teen that would otherwise have abstained from sex over fears of pregnancy, would now feel more comfortable doing so with BC. The problem with that is twofold. 


1. The chances of a teen taking BC correctly is not very high, making the rate of failure go up significantly. Now a person who would never have been pregnant (because they would not have had sex without BC, or maybe would have used a condom) has a higher chance of becoming so. It is much easier to forget your pills than it is to put a condom on incorrectly. When my sons get older, and we have that talk, I will make sure they know to always use a condom if their partner tells them they are on HBC. Leaving it to chance that they take it correctly is not worth the risk. 


2. STDs. Hormonal birth control does absolutely nothing to protect you from getting or giving STDs. Someone may think ""oh it's ok, I'm on birth control."" Then find out later, they aren't pregnant, but now they have syphilis! Teens need to be educated about this so they don't find themselves with a case of herpes, because their local planned parenthood threw some BC pills at them and said ""have fun!""


And that is why I think we should be encouraging condoms way more than HBC.

Your reasoning is faulty because it relies on the assumption that all living organisms are equal. We give special distinction to human beings because they are conscious, self-aware, capable of rational thought, our species, and some people believe, made in the image of God. Other animals do not have those unique qualities, and are therefore not part of the abortion issue. You may try to argue that an fetus isn't conscious, self-aware, or capable of rational thought, but they simply have to belong to that species to be awarded the protections given to all human beings, which is the right to life. As for your human cells vs human organisms, human cells are NOT same as human organisms. A human organism, which is a genetically unique human being by definition, always has the right to life. A human skin cell, sperm cell, etc. are not human organisms and therefore are not relevant to the abortion debate. I think you know all of this, though. 


Like I said, I've been there. I would never tell a woman what she should do with her body, but I would tell someone what to do with someone else's body. Bodily autonomy always ends, as with every law, where an other body begins. I always find it strange how there are so many mental gymnastics required to justify killing tiny human beings, when it's so simple to explain why it's wrong. I don't need to get into convoluted explanations of personhood and consciousness and everything you've got tucked under your belt, because it's simple. If it has human parents, it's a human being. It's wrong to intentionally kill other human beings. No mental gymnastics required. ",1,1516438229,2018-01-20 03:50:29

You gave mostly emotional, presumptuous, and flat out incorrect assumptions about abortion. I focused in on several key points and explained why you're incorrect. 

&gt;I am against the murder of human beings at any stage of life. 

Human tissue is not the same as a sentient human being. You know that. 

If you want to make that argument, how far back are you willing to go to draw the line? Any human DNA is wrong to distroy? Individual sperm? A zygote? 

You have no basis for being against ""murder"" when you've already established that a young fetus is not developed enough to even process pain, let alone experience life. 


&gt;I am against a woman's right to choose what happens to her body in the same way I'm against a murderers right to do what he wants with his hands. If it harms another person, it is wrong. It's that simple.

I could make the same argument about you eating fully aware, sentient, non-human animals. 

Except in the case of causing harm to animals, you are actually hurting a conscious being, not just their tissue. 

If you want to be against something, be against the killing of sentient beings, not early stage abortion. If you can't even start at that baseline then you have no business telling women what to do with their own bodies. Their rights far surpass that of unformed human tissue, the same way your rights surpass that of stem cells in a laboratory. ",1,1516429107,2018-01-20 01:18:27
327,"&gt;It is 100% of a human being, merely at an early stage of development.

Nobody is arguing that a zygote or young fetus isn't human tissue. Stem cells in a petri dish are just as human in that context. But they aren't developed enough to experience pain or pleasure, form thoughts or sentience. They are literally just undeveloped human tissue.

Undeveloped human tissue have no rights above an adult, fully sentient human being. That's simply the way it is. 

&gt;You have no idea what you are talking about, and are obviously here to get some kind of troll points for arguing with those who value the lives of the unborn.

Yes, we can agree. 

Nobody is really arguing for late-term abortion and nearly all are done before a fetus can even sense pain. Women would be able to have them done even earlier if they weren't blocked and delayed as often as they are. 

&gt;Prior to a certain week, sure, but that's not when every abortion is.

Good, so you agree that some abortions are OK?

335,"&gt;But what finally made me pro-life was I started to imagine the suffering of children who were being killed, and the fact that the only thing they ever experienced in their lives was violence

I really hope you're vegan or you'd be living the biggest hypocrisy you can imagine.

A young fetus (when most abortions are performed and when most natural miscarriages occur) can't cause pain to a fetus because a fetus doesn't have a brain or capacity to process pain or experience it like fully sentient beings do (i.e. The animals that most pro-lifers consume). 

&gt; I feel the pain of mothers who felt they had no other choice but to kill their child, especially the ones forced into it. 

Most mothers who want an abortion feel relieved. The pain they feel is caused by people telling them how horrible they are for having rights to their own body. 

&gt; I never ever want anyone to feel ANY of those things.

But you're content with the misery experienced by a woman who you're forcing to carrying an unwanted child to term? That's incredibly selfish.

How about the stress that you people put onto women who willingly want to have an abortion? Where is your compassion for them? Your support?

I'd want to explain why my point of view was logical. I'd want to give reasons why it should be enacted, and why the benefits would outweigh the problems.

So like I said before, there are reason, I personally feel that the mother has full responsibility for the fetus, which includes the ability to abort it, I don't look at a fetus and think its a person, I don't feel bad when someone gets an abortion like I do when someone's child dies, I can't imagine telling a pregnant woman that she isn't allowed to do what she thinks is best for her. But those aren't logical arguments, those are just emotional arguments because its an emotional issues, not a logical one. Even though you don't like the analogy, its like my trying to logically explain why vanilla is better than chocolate, if you have disagree, then no amount of logic is going to make you say that you actually like vanilla better. Now I can say *why* I like vanilla better, I can logically say that you like something similar to vanilla ice cream so you should like vanilla ice cream, but there is no logical conclusion, it is emotional and purely subjective.


&gt;So in Saudi Arabia, even if the will of the people leaned towards giving women and exmuslims rights, you would be against it, since the higher law(Islam and the Saudi Arabian consititution) disagrees with that?

I personally think they should have the rights, like i said, I think it would help them, and I would personally feel better about it. It depends what the will of the people actually is, to the extent that they do agree with the constitution, if the constitution denies women's rights and people really want women's rights then I would say they probably don't agree with their constitution, similar to slavery in the US, it required an amendment, because people disagreed with the constitution.


If California wanted to allow infanticide, it would be against the constitution as a baby is a citizen, and I think it makes sense that the state won't let you kill its citizens. But like I said, there are tribes that do that, and I can't say it really bothers me that much. 

&gt;Interesting how you got to that conclusion. Wouldn't have to happen to be any emotional part of you? I haven't once talked about anything remotely religious in this discusssion. BTW, I dislike religion.

I don't quite understand what you're saying, I was invoking religion as some non-sensical thing. Like I could say, God doesn't like slavery, which to me and possibly you, is a completely meaningless statement, similar to how me saying that something is universally morally wrong is a non-sensical statement.

&gt;So...you must think that it is fair if you yourself are forcing another person to live by the rules of your own belief system.
We agree that encoding our beliefs into law is acceptable. We just disagree about which belief system to encode into law.

Basically agree, we live in a society, some laws are necessary. And there is no perfect way to decide what beliefs should be encoded in laws.

&gt;I'm sorry by I don't see how that negates the fact that your life and autonomy were violated. The law, the opinion of the majority and what have you, is not a way to determine what is right or wrong. You seem to be confusing what seems right to an individual to mean that there is no right or wrong, but I think there are moral and immoral actions, and demonstratably so.

It doesn't negate that fact. But they would disagree that I had those rights in the first place. The law doesn't determine what is right and wrong, I don't think I ever said that. Does moral and immoral differ from right and wrong? I would certainly think they were wrong to kill me, but that doesn't make it universally wrong.

&gt;So you personally think it is wrong yet you tolerate it. And by tolerating it, you enable such thinking to flourish, just because you think there are no moral wrongs, because other people think differently. Your not liking things has little to do whether an action is immoral or not, or should be made into law to govern action.

I tolerate it as much as you do, unless you go over there and protest for women's rights. And that isn't correct, I said that I can find something so objectionable that I would want to make a law against it. Basically when you say something is morally wrong, I am saying that I really really don't like it, and would take action to stop it from happening.

&gt;How does that prove certain actions are immoral or not? Also, while I agree that each person has his own morals, I do not agree that it makes morals subjective. For example, in Islam it is permitted to rape children aged 9 and up. If you say that it is subjective, you are denying science and basic human decency. If you're not against this act as a universal, as a moral, you enable it.

I feel like you are confusing amorality with not having an opinion, just because I don't think there is a universal morality, doesn't mean that I am neutral about everything. I, like you, find child rape abhorrent, so abhorrent, that I would advocate for laws against it and to punish those who do it. Because I do not want to live in a world with where people do that.

&gt;I would think that the child's suffering from the loss of his mother's care and affection, and his cries for hunger, would be enough to convince anyone with basic human decency that it is wrong to abandon a child/newborn human being. And yes, I would question their decency as human beings. You cannot in good conscience leave a human being to suffer as such. Even animals deserve to be treated humanely.

You would think that, but some tribes have been doing it for centuries, or milenia. Maybe they think male circumcision is barbaric.

&gt;Surely you realise that saying ""morality is subjective"" does not make reality subjective. Here's an example: I believe that murder is wrong. You don't, and you kill me. I can't be happily living my life in one realiry while you kill me in another. If you kill me, I'm dead.and my autonomy has been violated. If you don't kill me, I'm not dead, and I haven't been violated.

Reality is't subjective, but you're autonomy wasn't violated from the perspective of someone who didn't think you had it in the first place.

From what I can tell I think the main difference is that am saying that there is no universal morality, but that I am perfectly fine imposing my own morality/beliefs/judgments on others if I feel that strongly about them. I get the idea that you don't want to impose your beliefs on others, so you say that they are universal morals, that just happen to align with your beliefs, and you are fine with imposing those on other people. I feel like your universal morals are the same thing as my very strong beliefs.

According to the CDC, the 20-24 year old abortion decline in the whole country during the same time period was 27%. So whatever edge CO had with teen abortion rates was balanced out with less edge for 20-24 year olds, and that group was just as likely to receive LARC through CFPI as teens. This is important because 20-24 year olds make up a bigger share of abortions than teens. And the overall abortion rate for women aged 15-44 in CO fell at the same rate as the whole US from 2011-14 according to AGI. 

So I'm not sure what lesson pro-lifers are supposed to take from this.

This is gibberish. You didn’t answer my question. This is becoming a pattern.

&gt;And I'd point out that the definition you presented was still quite slanted towards a legalistic definition,

What does that actually mean, “slanted towards a legal definition?” What does it mean for a definition to be slanted?

Let’s look at the actual words. The crime is given as a case of murder *especially*. What does “especially” mean? Well, it doesn’t mean *exclusively*, does it?

If I tell you I love all different flavors of ice cream, *especially* chocolate ice cream, would you say it’s technically incorrect to call vanilla ice cream something I love? 

&gt;even if you managed to find one that didn't make that distinction as strongly.

“Managed to find.” American Heritage was the first source I consulted, but yeah, okay. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t make the distinction you’ve made more weakly. It doesn’t make it at all. By calling this sort of crime murder *especially*, this means necessarily that there are kinds of murder that aren’t *that kind*. Just like there are kinds of ice cream flavors I love that aren’t chocolate.

You said you disagree that such a thing exists (“if you believe there is actually a ‘right’ to an abortion, we have to disagree”). Then you went on about your own “conception of a right.”

Because their is no other situation where one's desire to kill another supersedes the other's right to life (exception self defense). 

Some points that apply to your question. The right to life (or not be killed) supersedes the right to bodily autonomy in any other scenario. Consensual sex assumes parental responsibility. Negative rights requires inaction (as in you can not commit an action that kills) while positive rights require action (as in you must feed your child due to parental responsibility laws). 

To make it easier think of it this way, conjoined twins can not kill each other (even if one is more dependent on the other) because each has the right to life (or the right to not be killed) and this requires inaction from the siblings. But unattached siblings do not have to donate organs to each other because that would require action. 

The exception to this rule is parental responsibility or duty of care which forces action on the part of the parent or caregiver. This also applies in the case of a pregnant mother. 

Hope this helps.

And I'd point out that the definition you presented was still quite slanted towards a legalistic definition, even if you managed to find one that didn't make that distinction as strongly.

&gt;You’re going on and on about about a meaning of rights that I’m not talking about. I have no idea why.

Then maybe you haven't listened to pro-choicers discuss their conception of why their ""right to privacy"" or ""bodily autonomy"" is as important as the right to life, or even more important.  

I'm not arguing that your use of the word is wrong, merely that is is very prone to being used against you.  

""I guess if you think it’s wrong to control the circumstances under which a person is allowed to kill another person, sure.""

Which the pro-choicers do think.  What I care doesn't matter here.  I'm the choir.  I'm not going to purposely or lazily mischaracterize your position to make your argument look weak.  But they certainly will at every opportunity.

359,"There is no exchange of blood. So there's one thing. Second, bodily autonomy is always limited when it directly results in the death of another person. I cannot assert my bodily autonomy to fling a machete around in a crowd because it might kill someone else. The law tells me what I can and can't do with my body all the time. I can't take drugs, I can't drink and drive, I can't jump on top of someone's head. If you really did agree that a fetus is a person, you would see that they are protected by bodily autonomy laws just like we are. I can't kill my neighbor because i want to assert my bodily autonomy to drive a car into his house, why can I assert it to drive a suction tube up my uterus?",1,1516405184,2018-01-19 18:39:44

I appreciate the answer. But what justification do you have for this in the face of actual usage (which is what determines the meaning of words) and even, you know, the dictionary definition I gave you just before that you haven’t addressed?

&gt;However, if you believe there is actually a ""right"" to an abortion, we have to disagree...

You’re going on and on about about a meaning of rights that I’m not talking about. I have no idea why. Maybe you’ve heard about *legal* rights, as opposed to *natural* rights? A legal right like, say, the right to an attorney? Or the right of way in traffic?

366,"&gt;The minority does not need to stat quiet, they are certainly entitled to make their arguments, again I am not saying that your opinion is wrong, just that it doesn't really matter to the extent that society disagrees. 

Why does society's opinion matter? Again, I could name countless societies that have acted in terrible, shitty ways, and I am sure you would agree with me. Again, moral relativism is unfair, because some people get to act in one way, and others in another way. We shouldn't wave off rape or murder by saying ""different strokes for different folks.""

BTW, I have to ask: what is your opinion on ((actual)) racism and sexism? 

And keep in mind that if you say, ""We as a society decided that treating a person badly based on their race or sex is wrong"" - this is not an answer as to why we shouldn't be allowed to treat someone badly based on biological aspects of their humanity. What reason is there to limit this freedom?

&gt;And my point about why I think a fetus isn't a person, is that because it is subjective, it doesn't matter why i think that, only that I do, I don't need to explain to you why I like vanilla ice cream, it is sufficient to say that I do like it. I don't need a reason, its an opinion.

See, this I don't understand. 

If I had a policy I wanted...hmm, I dunno. Let's say I was pro-choice. 

I'd want to explain why my point of view was logical.  I'd want to give reasons why it should be enacted, and why the benefits would outweigh the problems. 

I wouldn't say, ""hey, that's just your opinion! Morality is subjective, like your favourite ice cream flavours!! I refuse to discuss any of the outcomes with you, because you can't change our opinions!""

The devil's in the details, as they say. And the details are important. 

I wouldn't want to enact a policy that I couldn't give an explanation or discussion for. And if I initially did, I'd want to learn more about it, so I could give a valid reason as to why I supported that argument.

&gt;I am not stating that it is a universal moral wrong, I am stating that it disagrees with my personal morals, sorry if that was unclear. In the case of subject things like personhood, the law should reflect the will of the people unless that goes against some higher law, in the US that would be the constitution.

So in Saudi Arabia, even if the will of the people leaned towards giving women and exmuslims rights, you would be against it, since the higher law(Islam and the Saudi Arabian consititution) disagrees with that?

&gt;The constitution doesn't forbid abortion, and it arguably forbids making it illegal to some extent,

Respectfully disagree. Roe vs Wade was based off of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution. There is no mention of abortion in that amendment. Roe vs Wade argued that because the 14th amendment protected the right to privacy, a woman should be allowed to have an abortion. 

Second, this isn't even relevant as the constitution protected slavery. Three-fifths compromise, for example. 

As interpreted by the Supreme Court, the Constitution protected slavery. In Scott vs. Sandford, the court said, ""The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race treat them as persons whom it was morally lawfully to deal in as articles of property and to hold as slaves."" [Link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/)


&gt;it should basically be left up to the people, so if the people of Alabama want to make abortion illegal then they are free to do that, and if people in California want to make it legal up until birth, then they are free to do that.

What if they want to expand that to infancy? 

&gt;My point about marital rape, which i never meant to imply that you agreed with, was that its likely already unconstitutional in the first place, we can start from agreed upon axioms about what is right and wrong and conclude that marital rape is wrong.

Again, you can do this with abortion. If you can't, there is no logical explanation to why infanticide shouldn't be legal, because anything you could use from the Constitution to explain why it's okay to kill a preborn child could definitely be applied to a born child. 

&gt;I am saying that nothing is morally wrong in those terms, its like me saying I don't think god condemns slavery, not because its ok, but because I don't think god exists, Its just a non sensical thing to say.

Interesting how you got to that conclusion. Wouldn't have to happen to be any emotional part of you? I haven't once talked about anything remotely religious in this discusssion. BTW, I dislike religion.

 &gt;And yes, laws very explicitly force people to live by a belief system that they may not agree with. The logic isn't just that I don't like it, it should be outlawed, I can certainly be tolerant of other peoples opinions and respect that they are tolerant of mine. The argument is that I dislike it so much that I think it should be outlawed.

So...you must think that *it is fair* if you yourself are forcing another person to live by the rules of your own belief system.

We agree that encoding our beliefs into law is acceptable. We just disagree about which belief system to encode into law.

&gt;They can kill me, I wouldn't appreciate it, but again as there is not higher moral authority, it can be in line with their morals, and not in line with my morals. 

I'm sorry by I don't see how that negates the fact that your life and autonomy were violated. The law, the opinion of the majority and what have you, is not a way to determine what is right or wrong.  You seem to be confusing what seems right to an individual to mean that there is no right or wrong, but I think there are moral and immoral actions, and demonstratably so.

&gt;What about women in SA? I personally would be happier if they had more rights, I imagine they would be happier if they had more rights, what does morality have to do with it?

So you personally think it is wrong yet you tolerate it. And by tolerating it, you enable such thinking to flourish, just because you think there are no moral wrongs, because other people think differently. Your not liking things has little to do whether an action is immoral or not, or should be made into law to govern action.

&gt;...Because it works both ways, everyone thinks slavery is ok, except for me, and I am correct so there should be some mechanism for me to force that correctness on others, but for that to work it would have to work the opposite way as well, if everyone is against slavery except for me, i would have a mechanism to force my incorrect beliefs on society.

How does that prove certain actions are immoral or not? Also, while I agree that each person has his own morals, I do not agree that it makes morals subjective. For example, in Islam it is permitted to rape children aged 9 and up. If you say that it is subjective, you are denying science and basic human decency. If you're not against this act as a universal, as a moral, you enable it.

&gt;There have been societies in the past and probably still are, where the woman would give birth and if the child seemed deformed or something like that, then she'd just leave it out in the field. That obviously sounds abhorrent to us, but how could you possibly convince them that what they are doing and have been doing for thousands of years is wrong?

I would think that the child's suffering from the loss of his mother's care and affection, and his cries for hunger, would be enough to convince anyone with basic human decency that it is wrong to abandon a child/newborn human being.  And yes, I would question their decency as human beings. You cannot in good conscience leave a human being to suffer as such. Even animals deserve to be treated humanely.

 &gt;Maybe they don't even agree that people have a right to life in the first place. 

Yes, and in Muslim countries women are treated like dogs. Islam does nor recognize apostates or gays as deserving of life. How they see it is irrelevant to the fact of what *is*.

&gt;The morality argument almost works in the western world because people do generally have very similar concepts of right and wrong, but you realize there are places that are completely different and have completely different concepts of right and wrong. What makes you correct and them wrong?

Well, I would say that to violate another human being's rights, to treat them as a thing, is wrong. It doesn't matter if they don't see me as a person, I am a human being, and I have as much right to live as they do.

Surely you realise that saying ""morality is subjective"" does not make reality subjective. Here's an example: I believe that murder is wrong. You don't, and you kill me. I can't be happily living my life in one realiry while you kill me in another. If you kill me, I'm dead.and my autonomy has been violated. If you don't kill me, I'm not dead, and I haven't been violated.

370,"&gt;“Is it wrong to say that Cain murdered Abel?”

Yes, I think it is wrong to say that.  For reasons specified earlier. And if you went to that passage you are then aware that the NAB's actual verse says ""killed"" in Genesis 4.  

I can speculate to the commentator's reasoning for their wording, but that is going to be fruitless without context.

&gt;But “anti-abortion rights?” I really cannot think of a clearer expression of my position than that.

I can't tell you what is a clear expression of your specific position as I can't say I have a full appreciation of your position.

However, if you believe there is actually a ""right"" to an abortion, we have to disagree, and if you don't, then I caution against careless use of that word in our culture.

My conception of a right is not something granted by the government, but which is believed to exist independently of legislation.  They are either recognized Constitutionally or are so basic to human dignity that they are a unalienable in a just society.  

Much more importantly, this is also the conception of many folks in the US who vote and who need to be convinced.  

Moreover, that's only democratically justifiable reason why a court of unelected jurists would have the power to use rights to override the will of the People and strike down legislation.  Inalienable rights represent the Higher Law.

So, if you concede that something is a right, but you feel that rights can be overturned, your words can be turned on you when they are read back to people who don't share your conception of what a right is.  

While anti-abortion itself is accurate for how I feel about it, albeit with negative, controlling undertones, suggesting that you are against ""anti-abortion rights"" is kind of giving away the farm politically.

405,"&gt;No. I am expressing frustration that you will not crack open a dictionary and look.

I know enough about language to tell you that your apparent understanding of a word’s meaning (that it *is* its dictionary definition) is naive. But if it pleases you, I’ll point you to a [dictionary definition](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=murder&amp;submit.x=23&amp;submit.y=18) (from the American Heritage Dictionary) of murder that does not depend necessarily on its unlawfulness:

“The killing of another person without justification or excuse, especially the crime of killing a person with malice aforethought or with recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.”

Now you might note that this is different from other dictionary definitions! Sure it is. That’s why dictionary definitions are helpful for people learning a word for the first time (and not always as helpful as we’d like), not so much for discussions like this. Dictionary definitions have deficiencies just by virtue of what they are. At a higher level, it’s better to look at the data our dictionary definitions are based on: usage!

I’ll give you one example, from a footnote in the New American Bible: “The story is about two brothers (the word “brother” occurs seven times) and God’s unexplained preference for one, which provokes the first murder.“

&gt;I thought I made it pretty clear, but to put it more clearly, if the Bible says that Abel was ""killed"", I don't see why I'd change that wording to a meaning that is less accurate.

Wow! You still haven’t answered it. It’s a “yes” or “no” question. It’s also not a question about translation or the language of the Bible itself. It’s about this statement made in the present that I’m putting in italics: “Is it wrong to say that *Cain murdered Abel*?”

&gt;The current reality of our legal system is what we're working to change. It has manufactured rights where they don't exist.

Where our legal system protects certain actions (like, say, abortion), legal rights do exist. I am not and have not been talking about whether Roe v. Wade was judicial overreach, whether it was based on good legal reasoning, whatever, but I really suspect you knew that already, so I don’t know why you’re explaining it.

No.  I am expressing frustration that you will not crack open a dictionary and look.

&gt;You know what else is a legal term? “Bail.”

Actually, if you go to the dictionary, the word bail has three different formal definitions, only one of which is the legal one you are referring to.  

&gt;You didn’t answer the question, though.

I thought I made it pretty clear, but to put it more clearly, if the Bible says that Abel was ""killed"",  I don't see why I'd change that wording to a meaning that is less accurate.  

&gt;Well that’s too bad if you don’t want to engage with the reality of our legal system. But I think you’re making the same mistake you made before.

The current reality of our legal system is what we're working to change.  It has manufactured rights where they don't exist.

Don't get me wrong, I know and believe that the government can legitimately create laws that can have wide impact, but that is a *legislative* function.  

But *Roe v. Wade* overruled actual laws passed by legislatures in favor of a right that someone made up by reading between some lines.  It was, and is, judicial overreach.  It's anti-democratic.  The justices legislated a whole new right into existence to justify their legislation.  

That's not their job, but they did it, because without a ""right"" they had no authority to override the legislature.  

&gt;Bravo, I guess, but I don’t think I’m as impressed with that stuff as you are.

I'm not particularly impressed with rhetorical arguments, personally.  But I have seen more than one good argument bite the dust because the opposing side shifts the narrative successfully.

Do I think most people are stupid?  No.  Do I believe that they do not give most issues enough attention to make an informed decision?  Absolutely.  And that is why when you make arguments, you need to get the most across in the least amount of time and you need to get people to not be pre-prejudiced against your position from the get-go.

The resulting child, or the father, or anyone else is not involved in any way. In that case, why should they trust a man to know what that situation is like at all? They'll never have to deal with it, right? And even if they used to be a fetus at one point, that wasn't *really* them yet because it was just a lifeless clump of cells or whatever. 

It makes perfect sense to you and I why anyone should be able to have an opinion or stand up against these things. But on the other side, it is *only* and issue affecting women and therefore can *only* be understood by women (unless you're a woman like me and you disagree of course, because *that* makes perfect sense???).

You know what else is a legal term? “Bail.” But if I say “Thanks for bailing me out of that awkward conversation!” or “I need help bailing the water out of this boat!” am I using it nonliterally or rhetorically?

429,"I see what you're saying, but there are plenty of reasons, big and small, that could have caused a person not to exist had they been different. For example, if the egg cell that you came from just so happened to be fertilized by a different sperm cell, everything else being completely the same, you wouldn't exist. Just that tiny variation would have created an entirely different person, and you would have never been alive. Or what if, on the day you were conceived, your parents decided not to have sex for whatever reason? Or what if your parents never happened to meet to begin with? You wouldn't exist then, either. 

Is that scary to think about? To me it is. It's pretty crazy to think about. But does that mean that those changes were wrong, or that it was comparable to killing you? I don't think so. 

But let's think more about your example. What if your mom was married before she met your dad, but her first husband was murdered? Then she met your dad and eventually had you. Does that mean that the murder of your mother's first husband was justified or even *good*? In a way, his murder allowed you to exist. 

I hope this is all making sense. But my point is that plenty of things could cause someone to exist or not exist. That fact alone doesn't make those changes right or wrong. However, when you start talking about changes involving abortion or killing an innocent person (which, I, and most people on this sub see as the same thing), that's when it becomes a different conversation entirely.

430,"&gt;&gt; Your answer really didn't do anything to specify 39 weeks. Saying ""because then it isn't murder"" as an answer to that question leaves me with no reason to do it at 39 rather than 38 or 40 weeks.

&gt; I've already answered why killing/ ""terminating"" or whatever you prefer to say them early just because they will die later is wrong. Feel free to reread my previous comments. 

Like I said, you've never described why 39 weeks, and not 40 or 41 or 38 or 37 or 34 or 32.  The closest I have to an answer is extrapolating from the rest and it's, ""because that's what you would do if they didn't have renal agenesis,"" and that's just such an unbelievable answer that I'm having difficulty with it.

Yeah, that's what we would do if they didn't.  But they do, and so the reasons that we deliver at 39 weeks no longer apply.  So why not 38 weeks?

But... yeah, you're right.  You always answer the same thing, and you think that makes me the stupid one.  I promise to you that it really does screw up all of obstetric decision-making to require doctors to treat fetuses with no chance of survival as though they were fetuses with every chance of survival.  But you would prefer, it seems, that women suffer, so that newborns can die at a greater gestational age rather than a lesser one.  I cannot understand why this is your preference.

What you did was explain that abortion is not “technically” murder as if I was somehow mistaken about the legal reality. And again, I’m not using “murder” rhetorically. When I say that abortion is murder, that’s a statement of fact.

You *know* I’m not talking about a legal concept here. There’s no reason to think that I am.

That’s not really how words work. Certainly not this one. Is it wrong to say that Cain murdered Abel, since after all there were no laws on Earth at the time? 

You can prescribe the use of words in some contexts, like a legal one, but we’re not in a court of law, are we?

&gt;My point is that, just as abortion is not technically murder, but still a valid term to use, pro-life can be general as term, but is still valid and instructive in the specific context we are using it. It also serves an important rhetorical usage in the forum of debate.

And my point about why I think a fetus isn't a person, is that because it is subjective, it doesn't matter *why* i think that, only that I do, I don't need to explain to you *why* I like vanilla ice cream, it is sufficient to say that I do like it. I don't need a reason, its an opinion.

&gt;I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping you would say that.

&gt;You say that morality is subjective, but then argue that other things are wrong(even if you think it's alright for others to disagree, you are stating that it is a moral wrong). You then say that abortion isn't wrong, and from your previous comments you say it is because a fetus isn't a ""person"", your reason being that personhood doesnt start until birth. Yet you haven't provided any reasoning as to support this, other than your opinion that personhood starts at birth. This conversation is about what the law should be, not what he law is.

I am not stating that it is a universal moral wrong, I am stating that it disagrees with my personal morals, sorry if that was unclear. In the case of subject things like personhood, the law should reflect the will of the people unless that goes against some higher law, in the US that would be the constitution. The constitution doesn't forbid abortion, and it arguably forbids making it illegal to some extent, it should basically be left up to the people, so if the people of Alabama want to make abortion illegal then they are free to do that, and if people in California want to make it legal up until birth, then they are free to do that.

My point about marital rape, which i never meant to imply that you agreed with, was that its likely already unconstitutional in the first place, we can start from agreed upon axioms about what is right and wrong and conclude that marital rape is wrong.

&gt;So you're saying slavery isn't morally wrong. Interesting. And you use the logic of ""well, I don't like it, so it should be outlawed!""
&gt;Question: If you support any laws, aren't you by definition forcing other people to live by your belief system even if they disagree with it?

I am saying that nothing is morally wrong in those terms, its like me saying I don't think god condemns slavery, not because its ok, but because I don't think god exists, Its just a non sensical thing to say. And yes, laws very explicitly force people to live by a belief system that they may not agree with. The logic isn't just that I don't like it, it should be outlawed, I can certainly be tolerant of other peoples opinions and respect that they are tolerant of mine. The argument is that I dislike it so much that I think it should be outlawed.

&gt;Can any enemy of your country morally kill you if she sees it as morally right(and, for good measure, the majority of her people)? I mean you've just said there no such thing as objective morality and that, morality being subjective, majority rules. What about women's rights in Saudi Arabia?

They can kill me, I wouldn't appreciate it, but again as there is not higher moral authority, it can be in line with their morals, and not in line with my morals. What about women in SA? I personally would be happier if they had more rights, I imagine they would be happier if they had more rights, what does morality have to do with it?

The majority can certainly make shitty decisions, and certainly has, but aside from agreeing upon general principles in the first places like we do with the constitution in order to prevent a tyranny of the majority situation, there isn't really any mechanism to acknowledge some moral minority, just give them a chance to convince the people they are correct. Because it works both ways, everyone thinks slavery is ok, except for me, and I am correct so there should be some mechanism for me to force that correctness on others, but for that to work it would have to work the opposite way as well, if everyone is against slavery except for me, i would have a mechanism to force my incorrect beliefs on society.  

There have been societies in the past and probably still are, where the woman would give birth and if the child seemed deformed or something like that, then she'd just leave it out in the field. That obviously sounds abhorrent to us, but how could you possibly convince them that what they are doing and have been doing for thousands of years is wrong? Maybe they don't even agree that people have a right to life in the first place. The morality argument almost works in the western world because people do generally have very similar concepts of right and wrong, but you realize there are places that are completely different and have completely different concepts of right and wrong. What makes you correct and them wrong?

You just put the words anti and rights in the same sentence where you described our position.  

You also put the words ""abortion"" and ""rights"" together.  So you are framing the argument the way the pro-choicers want it framed: its all about someone's rights.

Rhetorically, people who are very inclined to care about individual rights see ""abortion"" and ""rights"" together and they conflate the loss of legalized abortion with the loss of some ""right"".  So, if you're anti-abortion rights, you sound like you are for the restriction of some right.  

Also, the ""anti"" prefix makes the argument sound negative, as opposed to positive.  That's why both sides want to be ""pro"" something.

Saying anti-abortion isn't inaccurate, but this is politics, and people who don't do the actual investigation on their own (ie. most voters) consume their political positions in soundbyte sized chunks.  You need to get the most across with the least words.  That means even the words have to be carefully worked out for connotation lest the terminology itself give rise to some idea of being ""anti-rights"".

445,"""Anti-abortion"" or ""anti-abortion rights"" has been the standard for mainstream news sources for years now. The terms aren't inaccurate but they often characterize the other side as ""pro-reproductive rights"" or ""supports reproductive rights"" which IMO is a bit one-sided. I'd prefer it if they'd occasionally use something like ""pro fetal rights"" rather than always presenting the pro-life side as opposing rights. ",1,1516382203,2018-01-19 12:16:43

449,"&gt;You can say that you don't think certain groups of humans aren't people, but that is pretty meaningless unless you get a lot of people to agree with you.

No, it's not, because if humanity and personhood is subjective, I don't need everyone to agree with you.

&gt;So marital rape is a good example. I show you some arguments and you still think that marital rape is ok.

Your comment here makes me suspicious as to whether you actually read my comment or skimmed through it to find points you disagree with. I'm not saying marital rape is okay. What I'm saying is that the *majority of society pre-90s* thought that it should not be illegal. My argument isn't that marital rape should be legal, my argument is that according to you, since your opinion is the majority rules, it would be, since only a minority disagreed with them.

Also,[straw -man fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman)


 &gt;Few issues here, it goes against already established and agreed upon morals or ideas. We both agree, and society agrees that rape is wrong, therefore its likely wrong within your own moral framework, assuming you agree with those other things. 

But that's not what the majority of society agreed with pre-90s. And you explicitly said that if society doesn't agree, then we must make laws pertaining to their position(ergo, allow martial rape to stay legal). So given that most people disagreed, should those opposed to marital rape have just dropped it?

&gt;You can make a logical argument, starting with agreed upon axioms. The personhood argument is a situation where we don't agree on the axioms in the first place. Nothing that we agree on really says anything about when a person becomes a person.

That's not true. [The majority](http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx) [of prolifers and pro-choicers](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) favour making abortion illegal in the second and third trimester. Not that this is therefore a book on personhood, or means that the majority need to keep their mouths shut, else martial rape would still be legal.

Also, [an interesting read](https://www.etymonline.com/word/person)

&gt;I don't think there is any higher moral authority, no. Where would it come from?

At this point I'm not sure if you're reading or thinking about what I have to say - Rule 2 is supposed to limit pro-choicers who are here only to advocate for their position. I'm sorry but I already answered this in the previous comment thread, as well as in the r/Libertarian thread and if you continue to ask the same question I'm just going to give you the same answer again. Unless you had another question that I'm not understanding. But hey, it isnt my job to guess what you really mean. It's your job to say what you mean.

Third, this may sound like nitpicking, but I'm genuinely interested in your ""morality is subjective"" view. You said:

&gt;*I certainly think those things are wrong, very wrong. I know lots of other people think they are wrong, but there isn't anything else that I can declare about them. I find them quite distasteful, so distasteful in fact that I might take action to stop them from happening.*

What if someone wanted to keep a slave? Who are you to dictate what is a sufficiently logical reason for legal persons to not be allowed to keep another human being as a slave? Please explain.

&gt;....That doesn't require me saying that slavery is absolutely wrong, not because I have any less disdain for it than you, but because there are no absolutes, I want it to go away for essentially selfish reasons, because I don't like it. 

So you're saying slavery *isn't* morally wrong. Interesting. And you use the logic of ""well, *I* don't like it, so it should be outlawed!"" 

Question: If you support any laws, aren't you by definition forcing other people to live by your belief system even if they disagree with it? 


&gt;I do think those other things you mentioned are wrong, and I don't think abortion is wrong, but that doesn't mean that you can't think its wrong.

I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping you would say that.

You say that morality is subjective, but then argue that other things are wrong(even if you think it's alright for others to disagree, you are stating that it is a moral wrong). You then say that abortion isn't wrong, and from your previous comments you say it is because a fetus isn't a ""person"", your reason being that personhood doesnt start until birth. Yet you haven't provided any reasoning as to support this, other than your opinion that personhood starts at birth. This conversation is about what the law should be, not what he law is. 

I don't like being repetitive. But I don't think you've addressed my initial question about deciding which humans are worthy of personhood. Even if you disagree with someone on what is wrong, by your own definition of morality, they can't be wrong, no one is right, it's all subjective. Which means you can't say I'm wrong.

 You further entrap yourself by arguing that majority rules, but step back on martial rape, arguing that it should be illegal because people could have morals leading up to the conclusion that marital rape should not be permissible. But I could say the same thing for abortion and it would still be true.

Can any enemy of your country morally kill you if she sees it as morally right(and, for good measure, the majority of her people)?  I mean you've just said there no such thing as objective morality and that, morality being subjective, majority rules. What about women's rights in Saudi Arabia?

&gt;For abortion, I don't think a fetus is a person. Presumably you do. Assuming that we are both informed, then we are just at an impasse.....I think it would be very unfortunate if women didn't have access to abortions, but if everyone disagrees with me then that is how it is.

The thing is, you haven't explained why women should have abortions. You've just said that morality is subjective, and that personhood begins at birth, but you haven't explained why,  You just deflect any criticism to your position with ""It's all subjective"", and you flip-flop with that argument to ""majority rules"". So given that the majority has agreed to horrendous things in he past, should the minority have stayed quiet? Or are you changing your opinion about majority rules? ",1,1516381710,2018-01-19 12:08:30
450,Blame the Democrats in congress (who oppose any measures to restrict abortion in anyway). ,1,1516381508,2018-01-19 12:05:08
451,"So, let's be clear here.  Morally, abortion does stand shoulder to shoulder with murder, but as I just pointed out to someone else, it may well be homicide, but since it is an unfortunately legal homicide, it's not technically murder.  

Will I start telling protesters to change their signs because of that?  

No way.  

That's because the reasons that most murders are considered unlawful also apply to abortions.  They are killings that not only benefit the killer materially, but that is their purpose.  By and large the overwhelming use of abortion-on-demand is to simply permit the easier maintenance of a certain a standard of living by the perpetrator.  The moment that child is born, no one would doubt that is murder.

In a perfect world, where people would not use exact terminology against us to create negative connotation, we might well just say ""anti-abortion"" exclusively.  But in a world that is run by rhetoric, it is important to maintain a message that is not only accurate, but also rhetorically useful.  And sometimes, that means we trespass on a more general term.  

Nevertheless, confined by context, there is no problem using that general term in this instance.  It is still descriptive and useful, with those reservations.  

Are we anti-abortion?  Sure.  But we're pro-life for the same reason that the pro-choicers don't want to call themselves ""pro-abortion"", it allows our argument to be mischaracterized as an undue restriction on someone's rights.  

I tend to be very much for people's individual rights, so it is important for me (and others) to emphasize that I am not of a mind to place restrictions on people that certainly can affect their standard of living unless there is a much higher concern involved.

I've already answered why killing/ ""terminating"" or whatever you prefer to say them early just because they will die later is wrong. Feel free to reread my previous comments.

They are against the right to own slaves, a type of property. The ""anti property rights"" name implies that people *should* have a right to own slaves. Likewise ""anti abortion rights"" implies that people should have the right to an abortion. 

&gt; a legal right to abortion exists. 

Yes, as did the legal right to own a slave in the past. Just as people argued that people should not have that right, we should now be clear that people have no right to an abortion, and the law should change to reflect that. ",1,1516380596,2018-01-19 11:49:56

People equivocate with the term pro-life all the time, even with anti-aborion. Haven’t you heard that the pro-life aren’t *really* anti-abortion because we don’t favor policies that are supposed to reduce the frequency of abortions, or because making it illegal wouldn’t reduce it anyway?

A lot of the debate around abortion, in my opinion, is about which rights should be valued most highly, and the questions of what does it mean to have physical autonomy and what does it mean to have a right to life. 

For me, there is also a question of if someone has never been conscience, how wrong is it to prevent a potential consciences from ever happening, and is it wrong enough that it justifies violating someone's right to autonomy. 

This can also often bleed over into question over those who are cognitively unwell, and I believe they should always be valued regardless of their mind state.

Do you think this is a respectable question? Sometimes I find abortion discussions hard because some people will say some questions may be ""to obvious"" to be respectable and therefore discussed with openness. ",1,1516372663,2018-01-19 09:37:43
473,"I am honestly pretty surprised at how many people do not think consciousness is an important defining human characteristic. I do not mean to be offensive with that. It all seems pretty intuitive to me, so that is why I am surprise. Additionally, I could be wrong.

Part of my opinion may come from how I value human experience significantly. If I see someone hurting someone else, I do not want the attacker to stop purely because the other person is within my species; I want them to stop because they are creating a significant negative experience for the person they are attacking. This is not an argument that we should all just seek pleasure. I just find that within tragedies, the most sorrowful parts have to do with how humans experience each other and pain. 

Here is another reason I think like I do. If I see my friend is brain dead, but they are still on life support and their heart is still pumping blood, for all intents and purposes that person is gone to me. That is what constitutes the grieving. I am not going to be more sad when they take the body off life support, which would be an ending to a living human body, then I was when I learned that the person's consciousness is gone forever. I may be sad to see them take the body off, but only because it is more concrete evidence of something that already happened. 

You see, I value the human experience highly. I do not think this value is important to the pro life abortion movement. I am not saying that is bad, we all have different values. In my personal belief, however, I would say that what would constitute promoting life would also include giving others a better life experience, allowing them to ""feel alive.""

14,"I see a lot of teen pregnancies and wanted to throw in some thoughts.

I want teen pregnancies to occur in a well-supported environment, where they get to make their choice freely and without pressure.  I want their education to be flexible enough to support their gestation and childbirth.

Some people on here are mentioning marriage.  That's a bad idea as an expectation.  Teen marriages have higher rates of abuse.  Child brides (remember, these are children) have lower rates of completing secondary education and higher rates of repeat teen pregnancy.

Currently, if a teenager gets pregnant and decides to try carrying the pregnancy to term, their best option is to spend those months shoring up support for childrearing.  A lot of people are saying ""they should give them up for adoption"" -- I don't actually think that's the best option most of the time.  Most teenagers carrying their pregnancy to term want a relationship with the resultant child.  I think the best scenario is them having an adequately supportive home life that their parents/guardians can do the caretaking.  Some open adoption scenarios may have a similar effect.

---

Adoption is an alternative to parenthood, not to pregnancy.  The choice of whether or not to carry the pregnancy to term is, in my opinion, pretty inviolable.  I'm not here to convince you of that, but I want to put under the ""costs"" column here that a teen pregnancy is higher-risk than an adult pregnancy.  For cesarean, for birth trauma, for psychosocial issues, for preeclampsia... she could be dealing with things afterwards that most teens don't have to deal with, like urinary incontinence.  This is not a benign choice.

---

If you want to fix this, fix income inequality.  I'm not joking.  Patients who have just a little safety net -- a little money saved away, a little more independence from the people in their lives, a little better education -- make their choices much more freely and without sense of coercion than patients without that freedom.",1,1511556888,2017-11-24 15:54:48
15,"I got pregnant when I was 17. The idea that having a child when you are young ruins your life is something heavily emphasized by the ""pro-choice"" crowd. It doesn't. I was poor, in my first year of college, but I had a reliable boyfriend who is now my husband. So that helped a bit.

We need to stop telling people that their life will be over, and start telling them that their life with be different, and that's okay. Doing something different than you had envisions isn't the end of the world. The stigma and judgement still hurts, but that's not my problem. Other people don't get to make me feel like I did something wrong.

So let's teach girls that motherhood is beautiful and that their lives aren't over, just different. We need to support programs and organizations that help people in these situations. We also need to dispel the myth that newborns put up for adoption go to foster care. They do not (at least not in the us, because of the increasingly high demand), and setting up an adoption won't cost you a dime. 

Like I said, I was a pregnant teen, and now I have two kids, a husband, and I don't even have to work. It's hard sometimes because I went straight from being a kid to raising kids, but they are my best friends and make me happier than I would have been with a piece of paper after college and a cubicle. I eventually got that piece of paper but it doesn't really add anything good to my life like my kids do. If pro-choicers could stop painting pregnancy and motherhood to be the worst thing that can happen to the world, we would be in a much better position with helping teenage mothers.",1,1511554606,2017-11-24 15:16:46

18,"My high school class had about a dozen, maybe more, mothers in it.  Lest that seem like a lot, we had a graduating class of 450, so it was a fraction of them.  It's 100% false to say that having a baby ruins your chances of WTF ever.  It makes it *harder*, yes, but so do innumerable other things, like poverty, lack of support, learning disabilities, etc.

Basically, I'd like to see teenage mothers empowered to be mothers.  This means education and access.  Give them a good course in infant and early childhood development (which, frankly, anyone intending to parent could use), help them become aware of the programs that are out there to assist them--the obvious ones like WIC, Medicaid, food stamps, possibly TANF (welfare), and less obvious stuff like assistive housing and daycare subsidies.  Hook them up with the women's center at the local community college.  There are scholarships out there specifically for single mothers.  There are online schooling options.  Lots of people like to be dismissive, but the US Military is an excellent option providing you have a family member able/willing to care for the child while you're away at basic and I think also tech school, deployments, that sort of thing.  I know a fair few women who enlisted and came out the other side much stronger for it, both economically and psychologically.  Oh, and lest I forget, I'd like to see the mothers given assistance in filing for child support and a decent custody arrangement, because it takes two.

Basically, I'd like to see much of the stigma removed.  It's not ideal, but it's not necessarily a guarantee of a horrid outcome, either, and I think in many ways it's a self-fulfilling prophecy--when one of my dear friends had a baby our senior year of high school, our piece of shit guidance counselor pressured her to drop out.  Mind you, this girl was an honor roll student.  She was smart enough to ignore the counselor, but I'm sure other girls weren't.  You tell someone their life is over and they're not going to make the greatest decisions, because it doesn't matter anyway.

Also, I don't want to ignore adoption.  It is a lovely choice to make, but I want it to be a choice *freely* made.  I've seen nearly as much ""keeping your baby will ruin both of you"" from the pro-life crowd as the pro-choice crowd, as though there's some baseline of middle class existence without which there's no point in being alive.  I reject that.  I don't like the guilt trips I've seen laid on girls to give up their baby to someone who can do a better job than they, especially because adoption is no guarantee of a better life.  I want women to choose adoption for positive reasons, not negative ones, basically.  It's hard to articulate, but I'd rather ""I'm not ready to be a mom right now"" than ""My baby deserves better than me.""",1,1511548845,2017-11-24 13:40:45
19,"1. The most ideal situation would be that she and the father are relatively responsible people. They get married, don't make an idol out of their dream uni/career, make sacrifices to live within their means, raise a their children in a stable home, and grow old together. This is the most responsible, moral option and easiest on the mother during pregnancy. 

2. If the father/mother is unwilling to do the above, then she can either raise the child alone or adopt the child to another family.

Imagine a baby born in a coma. Doctors say she will wake up in a few week. No one in their right mind would say that it is ok to kill her regardless of the fact that she has not yet developed sentience. That's because sentience is not the morally relevant factor.

&gt; That depends, what do you mean by “higher risk?” Is that a substantial and unjustifiable risk? Is the risk of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation? That is what the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before anyone can be found criminally liable.

It's a high enough risk that if I didn't tell the patient to take folate I would definitely be liable.  It wouldn't go to court.

&gt;&gt; Renal agenesis vs. posterior urethral valves

&gt; Neither woman may terminate the pregnancy. This situation is tragic but no different than a woman with a 5 year old son who has just received a diagnosis of [insert appropriate medical jargon here] that guarantees he will die within the next 12 months. The mother does not want to watch her son slowly die over a prolonged period and prefers to remember him as he is today and insists that he receive a lethal injection right now. Tragic. Heartbreaking. The answer is still no.

This is one of the more absurd stances I find among radical fetal personhood adherents; that pregnancies with abnormalities incompatible with [postnatal] life cannot be terminated.

Here is the difficulty that it gives me:

In every pregnancy, maternal safety (from both death and disability) improves the earlier you deliver (mostly).  Fetal outcomes peak at 38-41 weeks, let's say.  So once we hit 41 weeks, it's best to induce.

If the pregnant person has preeclampsia with severe features, we deliver at 34 weeks, because the balance has shifted.  We don't deliver earlier because the fetal outcomes get worse, and it's a balance that we have decided on.

On the other hand, if they develop eclampsia, we deliver them at whatever gestational age they are.

So for this pregnant person with a fetus not compatible with postnatal life, I have no benefit in continued gestation.  Fetal outcomes will not improve, and maternal outcomes will get worse.  So when do I induce labor?

In labor, do I do fetal monitoring?  If I'm in a scenario where the fetus is not tolerating labor and will die prior to delivery unless I do a cesarean now... in which case it will die after delivery... do I do a cesarean?

What if it's a breech fetus?  I would normally not do a primary breech vaginal delivery because of the risk of head entrapment.  But the fetus is going to die anyway.

The decision-making structure falls apart.  How do I put it back together?

The scenario with the complications of vacuum delivery were really meant to follow discussion of complications from *not* having a cesarean.

71,"If I may... your stated reason for being pro-choice is a poor one, and your stated reason for becoming pro-life is also a poor one.

If you consider the actual moral/ethical value of abortion you'll will likely come to the same conclusion as the vast majority of ethical philosophers... The grounding of moral value, sometimes referred to in the literature as ""Full Moral Status"" or FMV, comes from sentience. Sentience is the ability to have subjective experience. Rocks and trees do not have subjective experience, humans an dogs do. The degree to which we believe something has subjective experience is tightly correlated with the degree to which we believe it is okay to damage that thing. Very few people think it's morally wrong to cut a tree with a knife but most people agree it's morally wrong to cut a dog with a knife... for example. Fetuses cannot develop sentience until at least 18 weeks gestation due to development of requisite neurological structures. Prior to the development of fetal sentience the fetus is not and has never been aware of anything, it has no perspective of it's own, it does not exist according to itself. This makes it morally irrelevant, it (as a thing with moral value) does not yet exist. It exists only in the biological sense.

Life is not what is important to the moral consideration of abortion, and neither is having human DNA. Life is merely a prerequisite for moral worth and human DNA is not even that... non-human animals have moral worth as well.

80,"&gt;Why, then, do reproductive-age, sexually-active women, not have a responsibility to take a pregnancy test prior to drinking alcohol?

Morally they always have a responsibility to be aware of their fertility &amp;/or pregnancy status and act accordingly, legally they do not.  In a free society, we presume that adults will act responsibly until there is proof that they have not.  The industrial scenario you speak of probably relates to a workplace regulation for the protection of employees.  I presume that there are penalties for not following the proper procedure even if no one is harmed.  The burden is *very* low (look through the door before pressing the “on” button) and the risk of harm is very high.   However, there comes a point where governmental micromanagement of people’s lives does more harm than good.  The intrusion of legally mandated pregnancy testing of all fertile women before any drinking, not to mention regulations of how they would be required to *prove* that they took the test, far outweigh the risks of fetal alcohol syndrome, which is, if I am not mistaken, fewer than 2 in 1,000 live births in the US.

I think you misunderstand my proffered compromise for pregnant women addicted to drugs.  I did not intend to imply that such treatment be made mandatory or that they would be “locked-up.”  Their participation in the inpatient program would be completely voluntary and they would be free to leave at any time.  If they do leave the program they lose the immunity from criminal prosecution for any harm that they cause to their child stemming from their drug abuse.  It is possible that a woman who has used recreational drugs in the past could, in the interest of the health and safety of her child, refrain from doing so until birth even absent professional assistance.  There are many stories of women performing heroic feats to protect their children from harm.

&gt; This would make it very difficult for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was reckless in failing to take the prenatal vitamins because “[t]he risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.” N.Y.

&gt; &gt; fetus with posterior urethral valves

&gt; The mother may have the surgery or not, she may not terminate the pregnancy. While there is currently much litigation regarding a parent’s right to make medical decisions on behalf of their children, in this case the mother retains a right to decide for herself whether to put her own life at risk for a procedure that “may” save her child.

Let me draw a contrast with another scenario, renal agenesis.

Renal agenesis and posterior urethral valves have very different origins, but a same result: the fluid flow in a fetus does not work, so they have no amniotic fluid, so their lungs do not develop.  The difference is that with renal agenesis there is no option for surgery.

So a pregnant person gets this renal agenesis diagnosis, and has a choice: carry the pregnancy to term and deliver with no chance of continued life, or terminate.  I assume (**tell me if I'm wrong**) that you would support her right to terminate a non-viable pregnancy.

Vs the person with posterior urethral valves who, without surgery, is in the same situation.  If she chooses not to have surgery, she is in the same situation.  However, she cannot terminate.

Why?

I don't know why, but my mind keeps on going back to a scenario I heard (maybe in the news?) once.  There's a piece of industrial machinery that, when not in use, needs to get entered by a human being to get inspected and/or cleaned.  Anybody turning it on is theoretically responsible for first checking to see if there's anybody in there.  A worker turned it on without checking (there were some ameliorating circumstances -- he had a reason to believe there was nobody around, there were no scheduled inspections, there was no evidence of anybody being around... stuff like that, but he didn't actually look inside).  The last person to inspect it had been diabetic and had passed out in the machine and died when it was turned on.

In this case, the worker had no reason to believe that there was a human being in harm's way.  However, he had a responsibility to make sure there wasn't a human being in harm's way, because it was a situation where sometimes a human being is in harm's way without it being immediately obvious.

Why, then, do reproductive-age, sexually-active women, not have a responsibility to take a pregnancy test prior to drinking alcohol?

&gt; &gt; Additionally, by presenting for prenatal care, the pregnant person would establish that she did know that she was pregnant, and would increase her legal exposure.

&gt; This is true, but I think the part I was discussing was about people who were seeking drug treatment not prenatal care.

I know; I made my statement knowing that.  This is somebody who uses recreational drugs and is pregnant.  If she is unable to stop using drugs yet, it is to her legal benefit to delay any evidence that she knows she is pregnant.

&gt;  If a pregnant woman presents herself to an addiction treatment center, within a reasonable time of when she knows or should know of her pregnancy, then she will not be subject to any criminal liability for harm already caused to her child due to her ingestion of the substance she is addicted to if she remains in inpatient treatment under constant supervision until the birth of her child. This would have a twofold salutary effect of minimizing the danger of further harm to the child and getting the mother the treatment she desperately needs. What are your thoughts?

There was a thread a while ago in which somebody said, ""it's crazy, these things that pro-choicers suggest, like that pro-lifers want to imprison women during their pregnancies.""  This sounds a lot like people being incarcerated for the duration of their pregnancies.  (The alternative being, y'know, regular incarceration.)

I think that the first step in treating somebody with an addiction is that they are willing to be treated.  I'm not aware of forced treatment of addiction being terribly successful.  I'm having difficulty imagining locking somebody up for the duration of their pregnancy resulting in their addiction being treated -- although they might go cold turkey and they might reduce their physical dependence... I'm not aware of any forced programs that showed positive results.

In humans, implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the already fertilized egg adheres to the wall of the uterus. At this stage of prenatal development, the conceptus is a blastocyst. It is by this adhesion that the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.

In humans, implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur about 9 days after ovulation, ranging between 6 and 12 days.

121,"&gt;If I were seeking a prosecution, I might try to shift that question: prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she reasonably should have known that she might have been pregnant, and should have obtained a urine pregnancy test.

&gt;It sounds like you think that there should be a legal responsibility for women to recognize when they are pregnant, and the question is when that legal responsibility exists.

Nope, that’s not the ultimate question, though I understand how you made that leap.  I was a little too loose trying to translate from “Legalese” into English and should have been clearer.  The risk that a criminally negligent defendant *should be* aware of is **the risk of injury** to another human being.  Obviously if there is no reason for them to believe that there is a human being in harm’s way then there is no reason to believe that any injury to a human being might result.  There is not a duty for women to affirmatively determine the earliest moment when they are pregnant, but there comes a point in every pregnancy when a woman has sufficient evidence that she *should* reasonably know about it.  Each case is different; some women know really early, some not until much later, and a remarkable few don’t have any evidence until they are in labor (and even then there are those who don't believe it until they see the baby).  

Regarding women suffering from addiction who continue to use substances harmful to their prenatal child *after* they know (or should know) that they are pregnant,
&gt;she does have something to fear.

Yep.  People committing serious crimes that involve grave injury to others will typically fear getting caught.  A drunk driver who collides with another vehicle maiming or killing its occupants has something to fear when immediately seeking treatment for his own injuries. 

&gt;Additionally, by presenting for prenatal care, the pregnant person would establish that she did know that she was pregnant, and would increase her legal exposure.

This is true, but I think the part I was discussing was about people who were seeking *drug treatment* not prenatal care.

Listen, I see where you’re going with this and I am willing to propose a compromise in circumstances where a woman who is struggling with addiction to a substance harmful to her prenatal child is desperate to get the required treatment for her addiction.  If a pregnant woman presents herself to an addiction treatment center, within a reasonable time of when she knows or should know of her pregnancy, then she will not be subject to any criminal liability for harm already caused to her child due to her ingestion of the substance she is addicted to *if* she remains in inpatient treatment under constant supervision until the birth of her child.  This would have a twofold salutary effect of minimizing the danger of further harm to the child and getting the mother the treatment she desperately needs.  What are your thoughts?

127,"I’ll start with civil liability to get it out of the way.  I am not as familiar with civil legal concepts as I am with criminal so this will be very general.

Civil liability in family court would primarily involve having the mother’s parental rights terminated.  It makes little sense to permit a pregnant woman the option of terminating a pregnancy just to avoid the government taking the child away after it is born.

Civil liability in the form of monetary damages would be claimed by whom against whom?  A suit filed on behalf of the child against the mother?  A big part of tort rewards in the scenarios you describe would be in the form of costs necessary to provide the additional care necessary due to the damage caused.  Since the parents normally have to pay that (assuming the mother retains custody) then essentially the baby would be suing its own mother to force her to pay herself for the costs of the child’s care…

In those cases where the mother’s parental rights are terminated and the child is to be raised by another person I suppose there could be some civil liability there to pay the additional expenses that are attributable to her negligence.  However, I’d wager that the vast majority of women in these situations are “judgment proof” or very close to it (i.e. they do not have sufficient liquid assets to make executing a judgment worth the time and effort necessary to file the papers).  I suppose it’s possible that trust fund heiresses could find themselves in this situation occasionally.  You probably have a better idea on that than I do about that.

Now for the potential criminal liability.

Most of your scenarios involve a child that is born alive.  All the principals of the Reckless Endangerment apply in each one and it would be up to the trier of fact to determine if the evidence proves that the mother’s behavior creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury or a grave risk of death.  Unfortunately, many of your scenarios do not have sufficient information to indicate the level of risk for the described outcome.  Since it is the government’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant is guilty of a crime, in most of the scenarios, there would be no criminal liability for the mother.  I have more detail on some selected scenarios below.

The first scenario about spina bifida after failing to take prenatal vitamins I feel fairly confident saying that there would be no criminal liability because you state:
&gt;most people don't take prenatal vitamins while attempting to conceive and in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy, which is when they're most important to take.

This would make it very difficult for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was reckless in failing to take the prenatal vitamins because “[t]he risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.” N.Y. Penal Law § 15.05(3)  

The two scenarios involving children born with fetal alcohol syndrome could involve criminal liability.

A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when:

&gt;For a purpose other than lawful medical or therapeutic treatment, he intentionally causes stupor, unconsciousness or other physical impairment or injury to another person by administering to him, without his consent, a drug, substance or preparation capable of producing the same; or

[N.Y. Penal Law § 120.05(5)](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-120-05.html)

Intent can be inferred when the result is the natural, necessary and probable consequence of the conduct.  *See People v. Getch*, 50 N.Y.2d 456 (1980).

The children were clearly injured by their mothers’ intentional administration of alcohol to their prenatal child.  They cannot escape criminal liability because “there are reasons that they made these bad decisions.” Someone who has reasons for making the bad decision to drink and drive will not avoid criminal liability for vehicular manslaughter if he subsequently kills someone.  However, more facts are required to adequately evaluate whether their behavior could legally be considered “reckless”   under other statutes.

This part of the assault statute was intended to deter “slipping someone a mickey,” however with the current wording it could be applied to *any* pregnant woman who ingests such a drug, substance etc.  While the government would likely have difficulty demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that a prenatal child suffered stupor or unconsciousness, depending on its age at the time, I do not believe most people would support felony charges where a prenatal child was merely temporarily sedated with no permanent aftereffects.  To avoid such quandaries I think that it would not be unreasonable to modify the statute so that it only applies to prenatal children when any physical impairment or injury caused by ingesting the drug is permanent.

The scenario of the meth addict who was *totally* unaware of the pregnancy would avoid criminal liability.  She might be criminally negligent regarding the pregnancy, but I have not found any criminal statute that fits a scenario when the child survives.

&gt;Does your level of sympathy matter?

Legally? No.

&gt;Somebody has a balanced chromosomal translocation, and is advised that every pregnancy that they attempt will inevitably miscarry. They become pregnant. Are they liable for... something? Anything?

No, any death would be due to natural causes.  If liability for the eventual death fell on the mother simply for allowing the child to be conceived then every mother would be liable for the death of all her children.  Everybody dies eventually; some just take longer to get around to it than others.

&gt;fetus with posterior urethral valves

The mother may have the surgery or not, she may not terminate the pregnancy.  While there is currently much litigation regarding a parent’s right to make medical decisions on behalf of their children, in this case the mother retains a right to decide for herself whether to put her own life at risk for a procedure that “may” save her child.

&gt;A pregnant person is undergoing a prolonged second stage of labor, and she is no longer pushing effectively. Her doctors recommend operative delivery, and give the options of vacuum-assisted vaginal birth or cesarean birth. She elects to have a vacuum-assisted vaginal birth and has a subgalleal hemorrhage; the subsequent fetal anemia causes permanent deficits. Is she liable?

No, but the doctors might be…

----------------------------

I have found other assault statutes that could be applied in situations when a prenatal child is injured by the behavior of the mother.  They do not apply to most of your scenarios because none of the scenarios described facts evincing reckless or intentional behavior.

Misdemeanor Assault 3d applies when:

&gt; he recklessly causes physical injury to another person….

[N.Y. Penal Law § 120.00(2)](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-120-00.html)

128,"Firstly, I'm going to recommend that you also post this to /r/Catholicism, as the people there are almost all pro-life and very diligent. That's not to suggest, of course, that a pro-life stance requires a religious background, there are plenty of secular arguments against abortion.


I'll take a formal logic-based approach to this. The basic argument against abortion is pretty simple, with three premises.


P1. A fetus is an innocent person

P2. Abortion kills a fetus

P3. Killing an innocent person should be illegal

Therefore

C. Abortion should be illegal


This is a valid argument. If all three premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. I think we can all agree on the third premise. 


Most pro-choice arguments object to the first premise, saying that a fetus is not a person, or rarely that they are not innocent. Obviously the fetus is innocent, as they haven't purposefully done anything yet. Less obviously, the fetus is a person because they have their own body with their own human dna and was conceived by their parents. Pro-choicers have all sorts of arguments why fetuses aren't people, and pro-lifers have all sorts of arguments why they are. I like to keep in mind that historically, whenever someone decides a human is not a person, they're usually wrong. This is often the justification behind genocide.

Some pro-choice arguments object to the second premise, saying that abortion is not killing a fetus, it's simply withdrawing support. This is obviously not the case for surgical abortions, where fetuses are dismembered or otherwise destroyed before being removed from the womb. Ironically, the closest thing to withdrawing support, i.e. delivering the fetus then leaving it to die, is illegal. 

The case is less obvious for medical abortions. I'm no expert, but if I have my facts straight, medical abortions work by inducing something like a period, where the uterine lining is ejected and the fetus along with it. Some say this isn't killing the fetus. Personally I think they're just splitting hairs, but I can understand the argument. So I'll introduce a new, modified argument just for this case: 

P1. A fetus is an innocent person, and thus the child of their mother.

P2. Medical abortion withdraws support from the child

P3. A mother has an obligation to support her child, or to find someone who can.

Therefore

C. A mother has the obligation to avoid a medical abortion.

The first premise is just the same as the original, but with a tautology ""a person is the child of their mother"" tacked on. The second premise is a reworking of the original, put in wording that a pro-choicer might use. The third premise is new, but fairly obviously true. After all, if a mother refused to feed her child, she would be arrested. The conclusion is essential the same, just worded a bit differently. 

That about does it. It ended up being a bit longer than expected, but I wanted to give a nice overview of the entire argument. If you have any questions at all, or find a pro-choice argument that you think defeats mine, don't hesitate to contact me.",1,1511276564,2017-11-21 10:02:44
129,"According to the scientific definition, the embryo is alive from conception. It has 5/7 empirical qualities of life: 
1.) composed of cell(s)
2.) metabolism (use of energy)
3.) growth &amp; development
4.) response to external stimuli
5.) maintains homeostasis
6.) does not adapt to environment (this is related to species evolution, not individual organisms)
7.) does not reproduce (but neither can an 8 year old child, so this can be ignored)

Basically, this means an embryo has the same empirical qualities of life that a toddler does. In addition, from conception an embryo is genetically unique in the sense that is has a unique set of DNA that no other human has, and it will carry this set of DNA for the rest of its life. 

Once you prove the embryo is a genetically unique living human, it’s pretty hard to say that somebody should have the choice to kill it. 

The most common pro-choice argument is bodily autonomy, and a good way to counter that is by saying that there are situations in which we ignore bodily autonomy for the greater good of society. You can’t do dangerous drugs, you can get drafted for war or thrown in jail, you can get searched / blood tested by the government. These all exist to help society as a whole function better (in theory). Considering 18.9% of pregnancies in America last year ended in abortion, I️ think it’s reasonable to say it would help society to breach bodily autonomy in this case.

I’m all for increasing birth control measures in order to decrease abortion rates because birth control measures act before the zygote is formed. Hopefully this helps a bit.",1,1511273296,2017-11-21 09:08:16

142,"&gt;If you have two options, and one will result in 1,000,000 3rd term abortions, while the other will result in 1,000,000 uses of the morning after pill, would you consider the options morally equivalent?

This comparison is apples to oranges. For one thing, it's disputed if the morning after pill actually prevents implantation of an embryo. From my understanding, Plan B doesn't, but ella might. 

Assuming that ella does prevent implantation, not every woman who takes it will have an embryo that failed to implant. Ella primarily works by blocking ovulation, so an embryo wouldn't be conceived. So some women who took ella will simply not have conceived at all. 

But maybe you meant 1,000,000 cases where the taking of the morning after pill/ella actually did prevent a fetus from implanting. 

I don't think there's a moral difference in terms of the entity being killed. I'd feel more emotion over the 3rd term abortions because they are more gruesome and the baby can feel pain by that point.

Yet this assumption is FALSE. See [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/study-women-denied-abortions.html). Over 90% of women who were denied an abortion chose to carry their babies to term and raise them. In fact, only 9% chose adoption.

In addition there is an estimate 2 million couples currently waiting to adopt in the United States — which means there are as many as 36 couples waiting for every one child who is placed for adoption. See[here](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families). 

Not to mention that most of them are probably waiting for a newborn. And that cleaning up the red tape involved in making adoption happen should have been dealt with long ago.

179,"&gt;However, some of the proposed and actual policy changes appear to make it difficult for women to get very early (&lt;8 week) abortions. When this happens, I'm concerned that it's also just increasing the number of later term abortions, as women will have to jump through more hoops to get one, and may end up having 2nd trimester abortions instead of 1st.

I used to think similarly as you, that early term abortions were better than later term. But now, I think a lot of the differences between an earlier and later term embryo/fetus are pretty arbitrary. What huge difference is there between an embryo of 7 weeks and a fetus of 12 weeks? The latter is somewhat more developed, but I don't think there's enough of a difference to justify huge concern for the 12 week fetus to be killed earlier.

While it's true that some restrictions may push abortion later, they also have the effect of reducing abortions. As a pro-lifer, I would rather have abortions be reduced than try to push abortion earlier but be left with the same number of abortions occurring. ",1,1511222174,2017-11-20 18:56:14

A suction abortion is usually use earlier, followed by a curette to remove anything the suction did not get. 2. A D&amp;E cannot use a section, so it really is dilation, crush/remove, then curette to finish it off. This removes mostly whole pieces of baby 3.

&gt; Millions of children throughout the world live on the street. These children are among the most deprived; they usually have no access to health care or education and some of them have been victims of violence even before taking to the street. Street children are seen by many as worthless, and many countries have used violent and punitive measures to remove them. Recently new approaches have been introduced that aim to restore these children to their families and societies. Initial evaluation suggests that these schemes can be successful. This article discusses the phenomenon of street children in Latin America and seeks to provide some answers to commonly asked questions.

&gt;So, if you are a parent, think about the faces of your three children. Which would you rather have, poverty?

So, who's going to take care of them?  

Adoption, you say.  

That's not a bad idea, except there's about 135,000 adoptions per year.  How many more adoptive parents are out there to take up that 575,000 new babies for 2016?

You don't get it. Violence is proof that a wrong is being done. And the realization of that wrong is what causes people's actions or thoughts to changed. 

Violence would be wrong if one got some type of satisfaction out of it. But using it to prove a wrong (abortion) is the same as showing violence to prove a violent crime elsewhere. 

You are very wrong and I'm sorry to say, you pervert Theology. You need to look at these issues on a deeper level. You are only taking a quick look and missing the meaning, thoughts, and intentions behind these actions. ",1,1511133644,2017-11-19 18:20:44

This is the same exact law I use to oppose abortion. Pro-choices say that they don’t want to kill a baby. They are just trying to avoid economic hardship, etc. But I say: your avoidance of hardship cannot be achieved through the bad effect of your child being killed. Thomistic theology is KEY in opposing abortion. You can’t pick and choose from it.

At the end of the day, you are not entitled to showing images of innocent people who have no say. You don’t have the right to do that. You can’t claim that right for yourself. They are not images of you. They are not your images. They are images of another person and they belong to them.

As I said, it would be justifiable to treat the mother for life threatening complications in pregnancy even if this treatment would result in the death of the child. But pregnancy alone doesn't mean certain death for the mother, so it doesn't justify killing the child. All human beings have the right to not be murdered.

I'm saying you have no ability to truly take away the right to 'murder' a foetus. you think it is immoral and think it is okay to push your viewpoint onto other people but by doing that you are succeeding only in creating more inequality and maternal death. you are working against women. 

if you want to reduce abortions, like most people do regardless of which side they are on, work to reduce rape, and increase access to and education about birth control, work to eradicate poverty and classic so people don't feel like they have to get abortions. you.
you are not, because a foetus doesn't have a right to life over that of the mothers. you are arguing that a foetus should have a right to life, but a different one to everyone else because they get to impose themselves at the expense and endangerment of another human being. 

I can well understand how you feel about what you view as murder bc i feel the same way about vegnism but I am still willing to discuss and compromise, I understand that there is a division and not everyone will agree with me, I can understand that it is not my right to force someone to comply with my beliefs and i understand that in order to progress, there needs to be open understanding and debate and a willingness to compromise.

Again, I’m objecting based on Thomistic moral theology, which is the Catholic Church’s own measure stick for dilemmas such as this. It’s not only wrong because of the assumed consent from the victims. It’s wrong because showing/viewing real graphic and violent images is intrinsically evil.

I think that it is perfectly okay to end the life of a foetus by expelling them out of the uterus because they do not have bodily autonomy and do not have the right to use a woman's body unless the woman wants them to. 

my view is this: if a woman deems it personally morally permissable to abort a foetus then she may do so, because she has and always will be in control of her body 

if I personally, do not deem it morally permissable to abort a foetus then I will not do that, and I may encourage others to do the same.

I, and every other prolifer I've ever heard of, would allow mothers to seek life-saving treatment even if it threatened the life of the baby. It's basic triage. But we do not allow her to kill another person simply because she doesn't want to be pregnant. Her life is equal to the child's, but the child's life is worth more than her wishes. 

And actually that birth control stuff is all true. Abstinence works very well in cultures where it is actually enforced.  On the other hand, the UK and similar countries with widespread access to BC and legal abortion continue to have high numbers of abortions.

Also, birth control would not reduce abortions, 

- One, some forms of birth control like hormonal and chemical contraceptives are abortifacient themselves in the case that ovulation and conception do occur

- Widespread access to birth control is what started the sexual revolution in the 1960s encouraging casual sexual relationships in which pregnancy is unwanted, so that when the BC fails abortion is seen as an answer.

I'd rather it was but if a woman wants to use her body to create a new life for someone else, so be it.
 as for the second point, i don't think she should be allowed to keep the baby. she was significant in it's coming to be, but so were the parents, without the sperm and egg, the baby would never have come to be and i don't think she should have more rights to it just because she (willingly) volunteered to be an incubator for 9 months but got attached.

Disabled people, if they were a burden on someone, can be 'given' to someone else to have responsibility over, therefore they are not a true burden in the way that a foetus is. Furthermore, it's unlikely that a disabled person would be a 'burden' in the same way that a foetus is because they are not literally using your body and causing you discomfort and harm to stay alive. If they were you would have the option to stop looking after them. The nazi's did not lose their control over their bodies because of disabled people. (i'd like to make it clear that as a disabled person, i abhor using such language to talk about disabled people, but i for the sake of the argument i will)
There is still a lot of reasonable debate about when 'life' begins. Personally i don't believe that life begins or ends really, more that it is a continuum, but regardless of this.
The key difference between the pro-choice argument and the pro-life argument is that many pro-choicers don't see the foetus as an independent life. The fact of the matter is the foetus cannot make a choice, that is the way biology works, and to then strip the choice of whether to carry said foetus away from the mother is cruel. it is totally the mothers decision to be in control of her body, and i do not consider my unborn child to have equal right to their body, since they share my blood and depend on me completely, they do not get to impose themselves upon me. if i have the desire to take a pill that will trigger my uterine lining to shed and hence expel the foetus, that is what i will do. You can't give choice and autonomy to a foetus who fundamentally doesn't have it and never will. If you cut off access to abortions, i'm not going to stop exercising my ability to manipulate my own body, i'm just going to do it in a way that is dangerous to myself. I love my baby but if it came to it and i was living in an unstable country without the chance to give it a better life or get an abortion, i would do all i could to expel it, and that's my choice entirely. This argument also verges into antinatalist territory which i won't get into.

The most common pro-life argument is that the foetus has a right to life but:
- A foetus can't survive on its own. It is fully dependent on its mother's body, unlike born human beings.
- Even if a foetus was alive, the ""right to life"" doesn't imply a right to use somebody else's body. People have the right to refuse to donate their organs, for example, even if doing so would save somebody else's life.
- The ""right to life"" also doesn't imply a right to live by threatening somebody else's life. Bearing children is always a threat the life of the mother
- A ""right to life"" is, at the end of the day, a right to not have somebody else's will imposed upon your body. Do women not have this right as well?

No, you haven't harrassed or bullied me, you are one of the very very few people who haven't treated me like that on this subreddit or irl. The people who have been the most kind and supportive and those that encouraged me to keep the baby, barring a few online pro-lifers (who know who they are) were all pro-choice because they recognised that its my choice and my life that is in the question and they wanted the best for me.
You see millions of children being murdered by abortion, and as a vegan i understand why that is upsetting, but it doesn't give you (not that you do) or anyone else the right to strip others of their choices. I truly believe that if you want less abortions, if you truly believe they are damaging and are essentially murder, that you should be fighting with women, not against them. You hopefully already do this, but i know a lot of pro-life people don't. Support free birth control, support education about pregnancy and support governmental initiatives to help pregnant women, no matter their decision. I'm very lucky to live in a country where healthcare is free but you can be damned sure if i was having to fork out to give birth in america i would have had an abortion yesterday. 

At the end of the day, i do not view abortion as murder, and there is enough evidence and sound argumentation on the pro-choice side to have had abortion legalised in many different places all over the world, so you haven't convinced me.",1,1511083829,2017-11-19 04:30:29
328,"I'm not showing it to you as a scare tactic, it is literally the same justification the prochoicers use - some people don't deserve to live because they are a burden on someone else, because they aren't developed enough, whatever. 

There is no scientific backup for the prochoice position - there is no disagreement over whether the human organism begins life at conception.

Again I agree you are in control over your body, but not over anyone else's. An unborn child has a equal right to his or her own body. The wish to not be pregnant cannot justify murdering an innocent person.

I haven't harassed or bullied you, I've been civil throughout your discussion, and I'm sorry to hear that others have not been. But as for disgusting treatment, we see millions of children murdered by abortion, and that is incomparable. I'm sure you can understand why people would get very angry when they hear people defending that, even if their reactions are not right.",1,1511081770,2017-11-19 03:56:10
329,"that's not the same because regardless of whether disabled people are actually burdens, they can be a burden to someone else, a foetus can't.  it's my decision only. using nazi propaganda as scare tactics to try to convince pro choice people doesn't work, they are nothing alike and it's a big reason I feel that there is such a divide. 

people have different views on abortion which is fine, there are still pro life arguments that I agree with, which are part of the reason I'm keeping my baby. it was the disgusting treatment I received from pro life people both in person and online that fully solidified my identity as pro choice. no one should be harassed and bullied and relieve death threats because of a rightful difference of opinion. if a vegan did that to you you would be livid, but your arguments are shockigly similar. you can't argue to take abortion away from pro choice people bc we do have plenty of scientific backup which if I wasn't on mobile I would link but I'm sure if you did a quick Google search you could find it. there's a reason it is legalised, and that's because it is needed and has scientific backup. plenty of people have no moral issue with abortion. if the majority of the population was against it, there would probably be a change however, but that's not the case right now.

It violates the third criterion because one intends the bad effect (in order to achieve the good). The fourth criterion is that the good end must be “worth” the bad effect.

It can cause severe damage to an otherwise healthy person physically or mentally.  There are also complications with other diseases that, while not life-threatening, can really mess a person up.  Taking this into account, I would agree that it is not okay to force women to stay pregnant.  But I would hope that we would put some resources into solving these issues, as pregnancy has been likened to torture for some.  Most funding here in the U.S. goes to researching keeping infants alive and healthy, while a very small portion of it goes to keeping the mother alive and healthy.  We are extremely far behind other industrialized countries as far as maternal death.  

A study once showed that men are more comfortable with the idea of their own death once they've already had children, but women are generally just the opposite.  If they have a baby, they feel a stronger need to live to be there to take care of it.

I'm pro-choice because I've seen some poor and miserable parents who only went through with it because of social stigma.  I'm pro-life because you never know whose child might be the next to change the world for the better.  I'm pro-choice because you never know which might be the next Hitler. 

Most women I've talked to were sad about their decision, but felt they had to because they couldn't afford to give the kid the life she felt it deserved.  I've read an article in National Geographic about how animals in nature might kill their young if there aren't enough resources.

Evangelicals tend to live in rural areas, and rural areas, whether Evangelical, mainstream Protestant, Catholic, or irreligious, have low abortion rates. 

Evangelicals area the conservative branch of Protestantism. If Catholics broke themselves into several different groups like Protestants do, the conservative Catholic groups would have a very low abortion rate.

492,"&gt; I have a response to the first part of your post but need more time to give a proper response to the scenarios at the end. I want to do some research so I can give you as precise an answer as possible.

I appreciate the precision of your responses.

&gt; There is Criminally Negligent Homicide, which is a lesser crime than even felony assault:

But is, I notice, still a felony.

&gt; Basically where recklessness is disregarding a known risk, negligence is failing to perceive a risk that any reasonable person would have recognized.

I imagine two lawyers could argue whether the patient was reckless of her known risk of pregnancy (for the condition of having unprotected sex) or negligent of the risks to her pregnancy (given that a reasonable person would have realized she *might have been* pregnant and gotten a urine pregnancy test).

&gt; It would be a question of fact for a jury whether there is enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she reasonably should have known that she was pregnant.

If I were seeking a prosecution, I might try to shift that question: prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she reasonably should have known that she *might have been pregnant*, and should have obtained a urine pregnancy test.

It sounds like you think that there should be a legal responsibility for women to recognize when they are pregnant, and the question is when that legal responsibility exists.

&gt; A pregnant woman can stop using drugs and immediately seek appropriate care for drug abuse. If she had no reason to know that she was pregnant the last time she used drugs (i.e. not even negligent) she should have nothing to fear from an investigation if the situation is reported by treatment staff.

But under any other circumstance, she does have something to fear.

Additionally, by presenting for prenatal care, the pregnant person would establish that she did know that she was pregnant, and would increase her legal exposure.

If I were addicted to methamphetamines and, say, 6 weeks pregnant... obviously, I would be best-served by stopping methamphetamines.  But that was true before I was pregnant, and I wasn't stopping methamphetamines now, so it's unlikely that I will this time.  If I present to prenatal care, if I ever have documented methamphetamine use subsequently, I'm in jeopardy.

I think that you probably understand addiction well, and how addicted people act.  I think that this legal interpretation would encourage people to behave in a way that ultimately results in worse outcomes.  What are your thoughts?

I care about the potentiality of an interactive, productive mind. If orangutans could contribute to society other than being superbly friendly creatures, I would advocate for them to have the same rights and privileges we extend to those of mostly the same genetic makeup as ourselves.


&amp;nbsp;
The potentiality of a productive mind is of enormous value. Minds plan and create wondrous mental environments that, when translated to movements of muscle and tendon, can alter current reality. They can help others achieve that which resides in their own mental environments.


&amp;nbsp;
Minds working with minds is the basis of our entire social experience. We've seen that our collective social experience gets better the more we have minds that can learn and grow. In our society, more minds than ever before have the ability and access to learn and grow.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel that is incredibly unfair, given the amount of charity work the Church does, but I think we can't go wrong if we make sure we're having a pro-life position in a more general sense as well.

Israel is very much a state that was founded by a considerable number of leftists where there is a strong tendency towards the pro-choice argument, but I think they could be convinced by the more secular arguments to be more pro-life if the effort is made in the right way.

We don't consider abortion to be a ""right-wing"" issue.

Paul never indicates Jesus taught anything.

Gerd Lüdemann says: 

*""Not once does Paul refer to Jesus as a teacher, to his words as teaching, or to [any] Christians as disciples.""*

and

*""Moreover, when Paul himself summarizes the content of his missionary preaching in Corinth (1 Cor. 2.1-2; 15.3-5), there is no hint that a narration of Jesus’ earthly life or a report of his earthly teachings was an essential part of it. . . . In the letter to the Romans, which cannot presuppose the apostle’s missionary preaching and in which he attempts to summarize its main points, we find not a single direct citation of Jesus’ teaching.""*",-4,1506352557,2017-09-25 11:15:57

For this reason, and this reason alone, because I know how terrible our country is at dispensing justice fairly across all people, I do not think we should hold women criminally responsible for abortion.

59,"Is there a way to hold women who abort criminally responsible without unduly burdening women who miscarry? That's been one of the biggest practical criticisms to the idea of prosecuting and I do think it's an essential problem to be addressed. When a born child dies in the care of its parents, I'm sure there's investigation to rule out malice or neglect, but the matter can be more ambiguous with miscarriage and it's not clear to me how this could be enacted without putting too many innocent people at risk of emotional or legal harm. I would want to be more confident that we could tell the difference, or else limit such a measure to ""they went to an abortionist on their own volition"".

I'll admit there's also the draw of hoping a show of mercy to women will be more effective at changing minds than punishment.

73,"That's a brutal assessment, but it's true. And anyone pro-life - Catholic, secular, or otherwise - has to be made aware of it.

Read for yourself, if you can get over the disgust of reading two shady car salesman barely try to pass themselves off as clergy. But I'll give you the bullseye quote:

&gt;“It would never occur to me to present some sort of alternative to being ‘pro-life’,” he said, during a conversation at the Vatican headquarters of both the Pontifical Academy for Life and the rechristened St. John Paul II Pontifical Institute for Studies of Marriage and Family.

&gt;Still, Paglia insisted that the notion of what it means to be pro-life has to be adapted to changing circumstances.

&gt;“Precisely because I’m pro-life, I can’t accept, for example, the death penalty,” Paglia said. “Because I’m pro-life, I can’t accept that immigrants die on the streets. Because I’m pro-life, I can’t accept that in the United States, in these first six months [of 2017], there have been 6,500 deaths involving firearms, meaning more than double the number from the Twin Towers.”

He also throws in 'ecology' concerns for good measure.

Regardless of how you feel about these topics, make no mistake: this is an intentional undermining via an accounting trick. Pro-life will now, according to the academy, mean 'Supporting gun control (except for elites), supporting mass migration, global warming, and more.' Which, in turn, is being done precisely so someone with the abortion attitude of Hillary Clinton can say ""I'm pro-life!"" and the cardinals will say, ""Oh well she's not -perfectly- pro-life, but you know, she supports raising the minimum wage by a buck oh five, and that's a major pro-life concern."" Meanwhile, someone who opposes abortion will be called 'not-pro-life', and the same cardinals and other religious figures will say, 'Well, you know, you wanted to cap H1-B visas at a lower rate than the USCCB recommended, so in our view you're not REALLY pro-life.'

This is an attempt to undermine the pro-life label insofar as it means anti-abortion. Make no mistake.

Be ready for it, and be ready to fight it if you're so inclined. Or be ready to hear how Margaret Sanger was, ultimately, motivated by pro-life concerns.",13,1506208099,2017-09-23 19:08:19

110,"I'm not saying it would be easy to raise a child with no support around you. However, some of the people who want you to have an abortion now will likely support you after the baby arrives. Your baby is invisible to them right now. Once you have a child they can see, it becomes much more real to them.

Your baby will also become much more real to *you*. I was much more excited during my second pregnancy than my first, even though both were wanted, simply because the second time I could directly relate the baby inside me to the baby outside me (my firstborn).

This baby will make things hard on you, no doubt. By law you will have at least financial support from the father (which is probably why he wants you to abort), and there are lots of resources available for single moms. You'll get additional welfare support too if that's something you want to do. But the baby will not make things impossible, and as I said before, kids don't really mind being poor.

If you believe your baby is human, and it sounds like you do, don't kill him/her due to the mistakes/regrets of his/her parent(s). It's not their fault, after all. Your baby inside you now looks just like your baby will outside you later (although it's harder to tell earlier in pregnancy of course). There's only an inch or two of your abdomen wall and uterus preventing you from seeing him/her.

Adoption is not what you think it is. These centers can help you find reputable agencies. They can give you the opportunity to get to know prospective parents, and you can do open adoption or semi-open where while you don't have legal control over stuff (as you're not the custodial parent anymore) you are able to see how your son or daughter is doing and be a part of their life. I know you're scared. My mother was pregnant with my sister before she met my dad and had NO ONE.

119,"Yeah I'm about ignoring the MSM's labeling scheme. That would be confusing if I believed them. 

But I""m still not seeing the Neo-Nazi = alt-right connection beyond the MSM's labeling of the one group in Charlottesville, and most of the people identified (more accurately I think) as alt-right bailed on that event when they found out that actual Neo-Nazis were going to attend it. 

But then again, who else was going to come out of the woodwork when other groups actually start attacking and threatening white people? Fair enough you know? 

What I think blurred the line was:

- MSM calls *everyone* they don't like ""alt-right""
- *no one* has officially adopted the name (beyond who I suspect is the actual alt-right)
- MSM *finally* gets their actual Nazis in Charlottesville
- the regular right starts calling the neo-nazis ""alt-right"" thanks to the MSM'a repeated attempts

I'm trying to be very careful how I analyze this (I always find some mystery to dig into lol) so I wouldn't call it ""confusion"" per-say, more like I think the definition is changing, and I need to figure out what it's changing from. more-or-less. 

I could also see the actual alt-right getting confused with Neo-Nazis because of how they operate, in the realm of offense. The are the ones I suspect that made the ""racist pepe"" memes and such in order to ""trigger the normes"" etc etc

There's a number of reasons for it, such as loss of respect for life (which reinforces a mindset that justifies abortion) or the possibility of regret, or simply getting a procedure that you don't need to maintain your life which shuts down a critical system of your body.

Of course, since it doesn't affect the rights of anyone but the person getting it, I don't think the state should be involved or anything.  I don't recommend it, but ultimately it is a choice people make for themselves which they have to live with.

Also, I do find that open left tends to label *any* Republican as alt-right, even if they're the sort that openly denounces the alt-right.

I agree with this completely.

It should be noted, though, that the hormonal IUD has a [better success rate](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/unintendedpregnancy/pdf/Family-Planning-Methods-2014.pdf) than tubal ligation. 

Also the morning after pill is *not* an abortifacient. From wiki:

&gt;Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)—sometimes simply referred to as emergency contraceptives (ECs) or the ""morning-after pill""—are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization, which are necessary for pregnancy.[1][2][3] ECPs and abortion pills are not the same. ECPs work by preventing or delaying ovulation and therefore preventing pregnancy, not by abortion.",7,1506030975,2017-09-21 17:56:15

They are not really interested in forcing their religion on you. They seriously are just interested in providing physical help to mothers and their children. I mean, you could call and tell them you are an atheist and see how they respond and if you still feel uncomfortable then just don't use them. You won't be locked in either way. Anyway, now I feel like I am overstepping my bounds and being to pushy so I will just leave it at that. Let me know if you need anything.",4,1506030228,2017-09-21 17:43:48
174,"Ah I like when side issues like these come up.

First off, I've seen some evidence that the morning after pill is an abortafacient. Some theorize that one way it works is by decreasing the likelihood of implantation. This only matters if the zygote is already formed, and intentionally depriving your child of the nourishment it derives from you (e.g. neglecting to feed your baby) is gravely morally wrong. But as the guy below me points out, there's also evidence that it's not an abortafacient.

I've also seen it suggested that normal hormonal contraceptives might also decrease the odds of implantation in case an egg actually does get fertilized, but more data is needed. If that's actually the case, us pro-lifers have an enormous problem on our hands. But again, the data is a mixed bag.

So getting your tubes tied means no ova will be released and fertilization is no longer possible. No fertilization means no baby, so this is not an abortion issue. I wouldn't vote to outlaw tubal ligation.

However, I think tubal ligation, and deciding to not have children in general, leads to a life that is not as good and meaningful as it could be. I think that for most people, having children is immensely good because it lets us experience a kind of love that is not matched by any other in this world.",9,1506029373,2017-09-21 17:29:33
175,"Well, the most common way I could tell that they were alt-right was because they would almost always call me- and please pardon my language, but I had this word used against me more times than I care to count- a ""cuck"" anytime I criticized Donald Trump in the slightest way, and would also insinuate (if not outright state) that I was Clinton supporter.

They would generally push for outright socialist ideals- heavy handed tariffs, socialized medicine, even full-on isolationism. They would often leave racist remarks, especially if I mentioned that Israel has a right to defend itself (I've never had an actual Jew call me a ""goyim"" before, but I've had plenty of alt-righters say it in the past year and a half or so).

I know it's difficult to take things seriously with all the wolf crying that's happened in the past, but they hate anyone that is not of Anglo-Saxon descent.

I'm very aware of that paradigm, especially in the nature of recent events, so that's a fair criticism and I appreciate you bringing it up.

I'm trying to be careful to not do that here. It seems all ""alt-right""ers are Trump supporters, but not all Trump supporters are ""alt-right"" so-to-speak and that's *just as a ""on the whole"" estimation* not including the almost guaranteed exceptions.

From my estimation, the alt-right was *never particularly about Trump*, but had him as a figurehead because of his willingness to speak bluntly about things that most had to walk on eggshells in the public sphere. The original ideological birth-point (roughly speaking because it's too late for me to trust myself with a flushed-out articulation lol) was specifically that the:

**""I have something to say and want the freedom to say it how I want to say it""** mentality. In a very direct way, it's an opposite extreme begotten from the force of political correctness. Which is why I think it's a conservative movement for the most part, and I saw more pro-life memes or conversations emerge for that crowd than I have from this sub in the same period of time. (but of corse there could be innumerable reasons behind that, it was quite a stunning thing to me to see that be so insanely popular)

Now, what I've seen and attempted to analyze is still anecdotal, but I'm digging past that as best as I can.

The brain or brain waves do not suffice to answer the moral question of what makes a human being because ""the brain"" isn't the thing that has any moral significance. What has moral significance are things like the ability to feel pleasure and pain, ability to reason morally, etc. These are things the brain does. So the brain isn't what matters here but what the brain does. If anyone says the ""brain is what matters"" or ""brain waves are what matters"" then you can ask them ""why does that matter?"" And most likely they will answer with what actually matters which is sentience or consciousness. You can also ask ""why does consciousness matter?"" but that question seems nonsensical because consciousness and sentience are valuable in themselves whereas the brain is not.

But you can ask the question a different way: are not people valuable that are not currently conscious? And so on. The  answer is yes they are valuable because temporarily comatose people and people in deep sleeps are valuable. Therefore, being currently conscious cannot be a necessary condition for being a rights-bearing individual. You can tease out more ways that the pro-choice views are wrong and counter-intuitive using this socratic method.

The brain or brain waves do not suffice to answer the scientific question of what makes a human being either because it is conflating having all your vital organs with being a human organism. This is just wrong-headed. A human being without functioning lungs is kept alive on a respirator but that doesn't mean they are no longer human because they have no functioning lungs. Likewise, a brain that doesn't function doesn't make an organism not an organism anymore. In theory, you could imagine some sort of brain support analogous to the respirator. That wouldn't make the human organism no longer an organism. This is a sufficient reason to dismiss this proposal and this is just scratching the surface too.

YOU don't want an abortion so please do not get one. We will help you in anyway we can. 

Does your mom know about the baby? Do you have any sisters? Do you know anyone who would be willing to help support your decision? An aunt, a friend, a friend's mom, a teacher? This is your time mom. You have a chance to fight for your little one. 

I know you said adoption would be painful but, trust me the pain of letting your child be killed and extracted stays with you forever too.  

I have adoption in my family and it is a wonderful thing. It would be a great sacrifice on your part but, it would be the most loving and greatest thing you could do as a parent right now for your son or daughter.

I lost a baby at just 9 weeks old. It was heart-wrenching. Abortion will most likely not be the quick fix you think it is. And as you said, you love your baby so much and you do not want to hurt him or her.

Let's talk. Let's talk about options and how we can help make what you want a reality. I know you said you are an atheist but there is an organization that helps mother's in your situation. See [here](http://www.sistersoflife.org/visitation-mission-pregnancy-help). What country do you live in? We can find people that will help you.

Your baby needs you right now. You can be the mother that it seems like you want to be. You can do it and there is help for you. 

Contact me anytime and I would be more than happy to help in anyway I can. You are stronger than you think. [Here](https://www.newwavefeminists.com/contact) is another source. This girl also had an unplanned pregnancy when she was very young. She can help. Email her and tell her your story.

And congratulations on your new baby. I know he or she is still small but I wonder as his/her mom, if you could imagine the beautiful future he/she could have? You have the power to give it to her/him. ",11,1505878501,2017-09-19 23:35:01

257,"*Let’s start the basic dictionary definition of a human being: any individual of the genus Homo.*

Correct so far. 

* Alright we can see the being a human requires some sort of individuality. It requires being something greater than just an identifier. It requires a semblance of development that makes somebody an individual or a developed human organism.*

""Being human"" is simply being a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. That's it. Full stop. All of the other qualifications the author makes are philosophical and unscientific. 

None of these statement are even approaching reasonable and are all moving the goalposts so that the author can qualify being human based on his/her own baseless assertions, all of which are not scientific in the least but are based on moral/philosophical/ethical arguments, which is a completely different discussion. 

Unscientific in the extreme. An embryo is simply a word describing  a human stage at a specific point in its development, as is a ""infant,"" ""toddler,"" ""adolescent,"" etc. 

The point at which a human being begins to exist immediately after  the fertilized ovum completes its first mitosis (e.g. splits into two separate cells, and then 4, and then 8, etc). 

Any other ""line in the sand"" which is a demarcation of what the pro-choice crowd ""defines"" as being a living human being is ultimately false. Heartbeat? That makes people with pacemakers something other than human. Consciousness? Then you're not human when you're asleep. Viability? Car crash victims on life support aren't alive, it would seem. Brain activity? Awesome, it's okay to kill people in comas then. 

And so on down the line. A unique human life is inarguably  created at conception. 

Some definitions for argument purposes:

**Human**; a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. 

**Life**; the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.

A living human exists the moment those cells split. Period, paragraph, end of statement. 

*The fact that an embryo has human DNA does not prove it is a person, because human tissue samples have human DNA and human tissue samples are not individual human beings.*

Skin cells are not organisms in and of themselves. They are part of an organism. This is a false assertion and a gross misunderstanding of basic biological principles. ",21,1505876104,2017-09-19 22:55:04
258,"&gt;Biologically speaking, such an embryo is far more primitive than a fish or a bird.

A newborn baby has a more primitive mind than a dog, a pig, or a squirrel. But killing a baby is considered murder, killing a pig to eat is not. If we're going to define persons as needing to have a certain level of mental functioning then that raises the question of whether infants qualify. ",19,1505876067,2017-09-19 22:54:27
259,"It seems like this person is mixing a number of qualifications for humanity: size, degree of dependency, and brainwaves. All of these qualifications are by *degrees*, which is the problem. 

If your worth is dependent on brain waves, would someone who has more brain waves be more human? How about someone in a coma—are they less human that I am, despite the fact that their brains are emitting some waves? Or how about when we're sleeping—are we less human? If so, would it not be murder to kill someone who's sleeping, or high, or in a temporary coma? 

The same method can be used for the other qualifications—women are smaller than men on average, so are they less human or worth less than men? The disabled are often more dependent than average—are they less human? Or how about if I were to kill Siamese twins—both of them were dependent on the other entirely (could not survive on their own, because they're dependent on the body of another), so can I kill any pair of Siamese twins and have it not count as murder? 

If you believe that humans have equal value (men and women, disabled and able-bodied), there must be some value above mere degrees. If I am still a human of equal value when I'm asleep as I am when I'm awake, then there must be some other measure of value than sentience. 

Also, I'd consider the ""trot out the toddler"" example—is an infant less human than a two-year-old? Or am I less human than someone with a doctorate?

As with all these arguments, the heart is the question of what makes us human. Without inherent value, there is no distinct standard for equality or humanity as a whole. And if we do end up with inherently valuable humans, we have to question how and where that value comes from. ",7,1505875014,2017-09-19 22:36:54

270,"I agree with most of this! Just one thing I wanted to note. 

&gt;Having a child at 18 is surely terrifying, and without a doubt will be difficult. But having a child at 24? That's fairly normal, considered a blessing by most, and not incompatible with a wonderful life at all. That's 6 years between scary and blessed, a long time to an 18 year old, but a limited time none the less. Don't commit to a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

Scary prior to 24 years of age makes sense because brain maturation is at around age of 24 / 25. Brain does continue to develop after that in many other ways, but we're talking being fully developed at that age in parts of the brain that helps greatly with.. welll.. life choices and handling emotions. Not really excusing it, but they do say that risk management and decision making is poor at this point. I really do think this is why a lot of younger people have a tunnel vision when it comes to fear and uncertainty, then making the choices that hurt them in the long run.

Ehhh. I'm not sure if that was even useful to know or offer as an information.

274,"Ah, this is tough. I'm glad you vented to us. You sound like you're feeling hopeless and uncertain. I really hope posting here helped with working things through in your head and with considering your unborn child. When I was an atheist, I was still troubled by abortions. To my thinking, there was way too many questions of ethics, but that's not really relevant here at all. 

What's relevant is that you're struggling with making a choice. It's clear you do have this choice: keep, adopt out, or abort. I don't think that's much of a choice, but as a pro-lifer, innocent life is precious. It seems like you're venting here with the knowledge that it might have been uncomfortable for you because of advice you may not want to hear or some judgments that might be made on you. That's pretty brave and a good indicator of growing a strong spine as you get older, so let me ask you some questions since it sounds like you would rather keep the baby alive.

* **Apart from your baby's father, do you have any other support? Family? Friends?** At this point in your life, you need to talk to someone else besides the father and you also might want to consider setting up a strong network of support for yourself. Pick out the people you know would uplift you, console you, listen to you vent, and are warm towards you. Block out those who are inconsiderate, rude, and pushy, especially after if you've told them.
* **Have you considered talking to a counselor?** If you would like, you could ensure the counselor will not be biased towards prolife/prochoice arguments or you could ensure the counselor is part of a pro-life chapter wherever you are. They would help you come to terms with giving this baby a chance somehow. If you do go through with the abortion, you will need a counselor more than ever. While women go through postpartum depression after labor, women who get abortions deal with PTSD. Women who were unsure about abortions to begin with also feel intense guilt and grief afterwards. Yeah, you will absolutely need a counselor whichever path you take on this one.
* **Do you think the baby's father has the right to talk you into something you're not comfortable with?** This is important. This is about priorities. You learn how to prioritize the life of the baby, your own sense of what to do and what is right, and yourself. 
* **How did you decide whether your emotions would affect your ability to raise a child?** I think we're missing a piece of a puzzle here. I know you're young, but you're hardly helpless and you're not without resources to help yourself emotionally. Do you have other issues? Edited to Add: Just thought of something in reply to someone else's comment here, considering brain development, but you still aren't without resources.
* **Do you want to consider other alternatives for keeping the baby, especially in terms of financial help for doing this while in education?** If so, people here are very happy to share tips on that. There are also tons of resources in the sidebar. I already see great replies on this topic.

I really hope any of that was helpful. Everyone else made really good points that you've booked an appointment for someone who is sentient and feels pain already inside of you. I don't believe that you want to do something like that to a human being who is part of you.

Also! Forgot a major rule here, on citing for statistical claims.

278,"If you go through with the abortion but regret the decision later, there will be absolutely nothing you could do to change things and no help anyone could give to bring your child back. But if you have your child, there will be hundreds of public and private organizations, family, and friends to offer help when things are difficult. If, even with help, you just can't bear it anymore, there is adoption and relinquishment. 

And I know none of these are foolproof, perfect options, but the point is that there will be options and opportunities to change or improve the situation for you and your child--avenues to pursue, and at least the chance for you both to have amazing lives. If you abort you destroy all of those options and commit to a single, permanent, unchangeable course.

Having a child at 18 is surely terrifying, and without a doubt will be difficult. But having a child at 24? That's fairly normal, considered a blessing by most, and not incompatible with a wonderful life at all.

288,"&gt;So what do you propose she does with the baby? Pretend i am a pregnant woman. 

Once again: you're starting at the point of pregnancy. Rewind. Is this your third out-of-wedlock, irresponsible pregnancy? Your first? Did you make a single mistake, or did a long-term lifestyle of risk finally catch up with you? Are you responsible and reasonably intelligent? Dumb as dirt and easily influenced?

Those are relevant questions. I've nowhere said that I'd restrict all charity - that's ridiculous. I did say that there should be a personal connection with all charity, and yes, there should be remorse and shame and a desire to make it up to everyone else when appropriate. Yes, I've even talked about times where that's inappropriate - rape, etc.

&gt;Now, about your shame tactics working. Tell me the likelihood that it will be accepted in society? 

Bad question: universal acceptance isn't a good metric. I'm more than happy to influence individuals, groups, churches - the building blocks of society. And the likelihood there is pretty good. Despite your attempt to recast what I've said here as 'Arrr you wicked cunts', I've been not just reasonable, but nuanced. I've even repeatedly talked about the men's role in this too (funny how they're forced out of the picture when time comes to gather pity. That's life right now.)

And I understand why some women have abortions too. I also understand the motivations behind a lot of things I find otherwise detestable. I've said that the goal here isn't cruelty, and I specifically outlined what you just said as an example of something I'd reject. So either you're not really listening to what I'm saying, or you're ignoring what I've said to try and paint a dishonest picture. Not sure why you'd bother.

&gt;For example, if I ever had a daughter that got pregnant as a teenager, I would condemn her for being careless,

You monster!

&gt;but I wouldn't launch a full scale attack on her. I would be disappointed, but not angry. 

Where did I advocate a 'full scale attack'? You're throwing out all kinds of crazy scenarios I didn't even hint at - the harshest I've been is with women who kill their kids, and I believe even -that- can ultimately be forgiven, with actual remorse and acts. You do realize that there are a whole lot of grades between 'Completely forgiving and shielding of all negative opinions' and 'Beating the crap out of her for the next year', right?

But you know what? Let's play.

What would you do if you did everything you could so she could trust you, so she felt you loved her, that you were completely supportive... and then it happened again.

And again.

You're up to three grandchildren because of her. No idea who the fathers are. But she trusts you. She's sure you love her. Also, she's wildly irresponsible. She foists those children off on to you or your other children. She hits you up to pay for them, and look after them. She goes after any of your other children too. And when they get upset, she screams bloody murder that she *has it hard enough and she is doing the best she can*?

Will there come a point where you are, in fact, angry? Where you believe her behavior is absolutely unforgivably irresponsible? Where she has become a burden on your family?

&gt;But if that was your daughter who got pregnant, please tell me how you would proceed. What would you do?

Same questions obtain as earlier. Especially if I have other children. Ideally: I would make it clear that they had done something disastrously wrong, and that they now basically had a debt they had to pay off, however much I loved them. And if they continued to behave like that - if their life was one big long string of disastrous mistakes, without much remorse or learning - I would have to ask if I was willing to basically destroy the chances my other children have, to perpetually attend to the messes of one. Past a certain point, a child is on their own. (That people get horrified at the prospect of parents cutting children loose at the young, impressionable age of 'mid-20s' is quite a thing.)

&gt;On a less important note, please tell me about your attitude to contraception. Especially as it seems to lower the abortion rate, on top of the fact that abstinence only sex ed doesn't actually work.

Sociological studies like that are inane, and any class will at absolute best be one part of a larger cultural and social approach to any given question. Once again: the historical data is on my side. In eras of stigmatized out of wedlock pregnancy and where abortion was largely considered and treated as murder, out of wedlock pregnancy rates were near non-existent. We can have that again. One week of abstinence sex ed isn't going to cut it.

As for my views in general, I don't like schools, period, and think home schooling should be the ideal, even if it's not universally feasible (because of all the children born out of wedlock, for one thing.) 

But I believe in sex education programs that teach abortion is murder. Comprehensive sex education, call it.",2,1505857288,2017-09-19 17:41:28

301,"I don't know how you'll feel about [this essay](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430152/abortion-roe-v-wade-unborn-children-women-feminism-march-life) since you're right in the middle of the situation now, but I feel this passage from it is key:

&gt; ... once abortion becomes available, it becomes the most attractive option for everyone *around* the pregnant woman. If she has an abortion, it’s like the pregnancy never existed. No one is inconvenienced. It doesn’t cause trouble for the father of the baby, or her boss, or the person in charge of her college scholarship. It won’t embarrass her mom and dad.

&gt; Abortion is like a funnel; it promises to solve all the problems at once. So there is significant pressure on a woman to choose abortion, rather than adoption or parenting.

&gt; A woman who had had an abortion told me, “Everyone around me was saying they would ‘be there for me’ if I had the abortion, but no one said they’d ‘be there for me’ if I had the baby.” For everyone around the pregnant woman, abortion looks like the sensible choice. A woman who determines instead to continue an unplanned pregnancy looks like she’s being foolishly stubborn. It’s like she’s taken up some unreasonable hobby. People think, If she would only go off and do this one thing, everything would be fine.

&gt; But that’s an illusion. Abortion can’t really “turn back the clock.” It can’t push the rewind button on life and make it so she was never pregnant. It can make it easy for everyone *around* the woman to forget the pregnancy, but the woman herself may struggle.

So be careful that you're not trying to solve other people's problems by aborting. Many women get pressured into it; the ""pro choice"" movement in many cases provides less choice for the woman and more for their partners, family, and so on. (In the [other thread you recently commented in](/r/offmychest/comments/70y4tz/im_having_an_abortion/), there are plenty of people ""being there"" for the person who decided to abort.)

A lot of people who ""can't afford"" babies have them anyway, and while it's certainly difficult, I doubt very much that most of those people now wish their child had never been born. Yes, it sucks to be poor and have a child to care for. You can't undo either route you take here, and especially when you say ""but I already love it so much and I know I couldn't give it up for adoption, it would break me in two"" it sounds like an abortion would break you in two even more so. Kids don't really care if they grow up poor; that's what adults worry about.

You also say ""I just can't ... emotionally provide for a baby."" But babies (at least after they get past the early weeks to months when they need day-consuming amounts of care and feeding) have a way of emotionally providing for *you*. It's hardwired into us to grow emotionally attached to our offspring because they need us to survive. From your ""already love it so much"" line, it seems like your maternal instinct is already kicking in.

If you're 18, presuming you're done or just about done with high school, you'll probably have to put your education on pause for a year or more. Babies interrupt a lot of life plans, but that's okay.",44,1505847247,2017-09-19 14:54:07

In the majority opinion of Roe v. Wade, the court found balance between the state's interests in maximizing human potentiality and due process rights of a potential mother to exert total physical control over her own body before it had another potential human inside of her.

To determine when the state's constitutional interests in maximizing human potentiality is undeniable, the court decided that fetal viability would be the deciding factor. The court defined viability as ""potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid."" The key word in that definition is potentially. In this context, the word potentially means greater than 50% chance. The same standard as a preponderance of the evidence used in civil trials.

In Roe v. Wade, the court limited states to restricting abortions only once the third trimester had begun.

In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court rejected that somewhat arbitrary number and chose to go with a scientific evidentiary standard of restricting abprtions after the greater than 50% viability date of the prematurely born, whatever date that may be.

Now, about your shame tactics working. Tell me the likelihood that it will be accepted in society? Because it is highly unlikely that method will be adopted universally. In fact, it may turn people away from the mainstream pro-life movement. It's certainly made me reconsider my position. I don't know how far your shame tactics go but, if you use nothing but shame tactics, how will that help in the long term. The baby is already there. Just repetitively saying ""you're a filthy slut cunt"" isn't going to help the mother. It's just going to make her feel more alone than ever, as well as making her reluctant to find help for the baby due to the fear if being shamed. Rubbing it in for the next 9 months isn't going to help. Sure, you can be disappointed in said person, but continually rubbing it in and being completely unsupportive will not help in any way. It will just make her not go to anyone for help (charity, family, whatever) and make the whole situation worse. I don't support abortion myself (contrary to popular opinion) but I fully understand *why* some women have them. And we need to do everything to help them, charity, family support or otherwise.

For example, if I ever had a daughter that got pregnant as a teenager, I would condemn her for being careless, but I wouldn't launch a full scale attack on her. I would be disappointed, but not angry. I would never disown her, or continually scream at her for being a ""filthy fucking slut"" or whatever. I would never love her any less. I want her to still trust me, I want her to still feel as if I love her, and that she can come to me for support. I would support her, reach out to charities for help if need be. Whether she chooses to adopt or keep it, I would be there for her, during and after the birth. Even if she wanted to abort, I would try to discourage her. If that worked, then that would be that. If not, I would be disappointed, but I would never disown her or kick her out or whatever. I wouldn't endorse her decision or go into the clinic with her (most likely, I never hope that that situation comes) but I wouldn't disown her and kick her out. I would love her unconditionally and regardless of her actions. (Hopefully I won't need to be in that scenario, especially if she chooses to abort).

316,"&gt;Why is forcing her to have her child a thing?

Because it's a child and the alternative is death. You see this clearly 30 minutes after the deadline. Well, I see it clearly at the deadline, and 9 months before.

&gt;And as far as I am aware, there is a stigma against the woman, that she might be seen as a filthy s**t. 

Baloney. Common claim that doesn't match with reality. There's a stigma AGAINST regarding a woman in that situation as a slut. You're talking about a stigma that exists, at best, in the shadows right now. No one will say this on TV without being utterly destroyed. No one will say it in public if a spotlight will be on them.

&gt;Make your choice. Money or dead baby.

No, because I reject that hostage situation. I have a better choice: live baby, or prison. Also, 'not pregnant until stable' or 'social stigma and the cost of raising the child'. If she chooses 'dead baby', I'll be more than happy to deal with her in that case.

If this terrifies you, if the prospect that some women may actually have their choices impact them in some way, then I have a recommendation: get out there and advise, encourage them, to do what's right. If they can't swing that, they're not killing their children.

&gt;Firstly, I am against late term abortions in general anyway. 

Why? Why is it A-OK to force a woman to have a terrible toll on her body, morning sickness, pain, threat of complications and more when the 'fetus' is further along? Because you're personally squeamish about it, but earlier and you can squint your eyes and maybe pretend it's not a human life a bit more effectively?

&gt;Secondly, shaming everyone who even contemplates abortion is not going to help the pro life movement in any way. 

Actually, it's going to help *beautifully*. Because people are going to react accordingly in a world like that. They're going to take pregnancy and the risk of getting pregnant seriously, and we know they will because it worked in the past. 

Stigma, worked. Legal punishment for killing children, worked. And it will work again. That requires not just legislative solutions, but also cultural change. That's a tall order. But it's going to be pursued, because the alternative is killing children, and the right to fuck without responsibility or consequence (unless we all cheer on the stupid, disastrous results) is not sacrosanct.

321,"&gt;Why? Why is that open and shut?

Why is forcing her to have her child a thing? I'm not saying she should get an abortion to save her education. I'm saying that we shouldn't allow the pregnancy and the child to ruin it in the first place and try to prevent her from dropping out of school in the first place. And as far as I am aware, there is a stigma against the woman, that she might be seen as a filthy s\*\*t. On the contrary,a man who has sex a lot is seen as a ""stud"" and something to be praised with. On that note, if he does refuse, he is seen as a deadbeat dad, so I guess there is a stigma there.

&gt;Poor her. She needs money 

Make your choice. Money or dead baby. Ideally both should be responsible. However, pregnancy isn't just some easy thing to glide through. It can have a terrible toll on the body. Morning sickness, pain, threat of complications and more. It isn't just sitting there waiting for the baby to just pop out, done and dusted.

&gt;Why is that list of mitigating factors... grounds for sympathy or not even condemning the woman

Firstly, I am against late term abortions in general anyway. Secondly, shaming everyone who even contemplates abortion is not going to help the pro life movement *in any way*. Just random shaming makes women feel as if they cannot trust this movement, whilst the pro choice movement gives the image that they actually give a toss about the mother. If the woman gets pregnant and everyone moves to harshly condemn her for being a s\*\*t, it seems pretty obvious that she is going to panic, and try to cover it up. From what I've gathered, the pro life movement does not give a flying \*\*\*\* about the mother or even the father. Ideally, both should be supported somehow, be it emotionally or psychologically. Just saying ""don't get an abortion"" may stop an abortion, but it doesn't solve any of the factors that made her think about getting one in the first place. I'm starting to see the logic that pro choice supporters make that you are merely ""pro-birth, not pro life""",1,1505799304,2017-09-19 01:35:04
322,"Thanks. 

It sounds like a Supreme Court ruling is inevitable. 

&gt;The constitutional amendment would probably never happen through congress because it would be very difficult for pro-lifers to carry such high margins and because there are a lot of Republicans who don't want that issue to go away, enjoying electoral victories off of talk without action. 

I disagree with you. There are many people, pro life who have abandoned the Republican party because they believe they will never take action regarding abortion. If the Republicans did take action, they could win some supporters back, who may then vote Republican for other reasons. Republicans are doing a ton to take abortion away at the state and local level. 

[This survey](http://news.gallup.com/poll/188918/democrats-republicans-agree-four-top-issues-campaign.aspx) showed only 2% of Republicans consider abortion to be the issue they most wanted to be addressed by the next president. (was from 2016)  I don't think there's a ton Republicans that would stop voting Republican if abortion was made illegal.

323,"Realistically speaking, to prohibit all abortion (so not just throwing it back to the states), we'd have to see one of two things:

1. The Supreme Court rule that personhood begins at conception and that destruction of such a life is murder; or

2. A constitutional amendment.

The Supreme Court ruling would probably require a state passing a personhood law and that state interpreting this to prohibit all abortion. This method carries some risk since it is probably a one-and-done attempt. If you fail, the court precedent will be against you. To want to attempt this, we would probably want to have a more pro-life court than we have now, though some may feel we are ready now.

The constitutional amendment would probably never happen through congress because it would be very difficult for pro-lifers to carry such high margins and because there are a lot of Republicans who don't want that issue to go away, enjoying electoral victories off of talk without action.

There is a lot that is possible and a lot that has actually been done to restrict it, but any straight-up law that tries to outlaw it needs to go to the Court for a show down.

And even with a conservative majority, this may be tough.  The Court is very precedent based.  They may do everything they can to allow tighter restrictions, but they will be wary of directly overturning that original decision.

I think a perfect storm of legislation and favorable court decisions might be able to drive it into the twilight of barely legal, but nothing short of an overturning of that decision or a constitutional amendment will end the threat at the Federal level.  

Even the horrible slave-era decisions like *Dred Scott* itself were never overturned, they were just rendered moot by the amendments after the Civil War.

329,"Yes it was a really shitty decision. They thought that up until 14 weeks (the first trimester) the right of the mother to privacy overrides the state's interest in keeping the fetus alive, and therefore it permits her to have an abortion. Beyond that, the interest of the state to protect the life gains higher importance over the right to privacy of the mother.

Which sounds *somewhat* plausible on its face, except for the reason you described. However I must point out that to the Supreme Court, such a thing would not be entirely relevant, because the case at hand did not require that the Court simply recognize that abortion in the first trimester is murder, therefore abortion bans are constitutional, QED. The Court was essentially called to balance the state's interest in the baby's life with the mother's supposed right to privacy.

The correct criticism here is that the Court's interpretation of the right to privacy was totally wrong. The Fourth Amendment was *never* taken to mean abortion cannot be restricted by governments. The Fourth Amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches of someone's person, houses, papers, and effects by the federal government. No reasonable person could look at the true meaning of this amendment and think that it prohibited abortion bans. Abortion bans have existed in the U.S. since the early 19th century, a few decades after the founding of the country, and no one ever thought they were unconstitutional because of the Fourth Amendment. It's just nuts.

So in *Roe v. Wade,* there's no real conflict at all between the Fourth Amendment and the state's interest in preserving life. Hence abortion bans are not unconstitutional - or at least, not unconstitutional on the grounds that *Roe v. Wade* provided. ",5,1505781848,2017-09-18 20:44:08
330,"&gt;Firstly, I believe that the male should hold financial responsibility.

Why? Why is that open and shut? Why are 'She wants to get an education! This will impact her financially!' etc, grounds to allow her to kill her child - or at least mitigating factors that emphasize the need to shield her from stigma - but not grounds to just let the father off the hook?

Should he face stigma if he refuses? How about stigma for ending up in this situation to begin with? Here's a great one: what if he gets a woman, or multiple women pregnant... and he doesn't have a dime, nor does he have the maturity to assist her? Should we let him off the hook? No stigma?

What if stigmatizing men like that lead to pressuring women to abort their children?

What I notice is that women, to many in the pro-life movement, are eternally objects of pity. No matter what they do. Pregnant three times by three different men, no idea who the father is, entirely broke? Poor her. She needs money, she's trying her hardest, she makes mistakes. A guy ends up getting a girl pregnant and no one even wants to hear the situation, they know immediately: it's his fault, he owes money. He owes a LOT of money. There's no point even talking about his situation, not even 'She swore she was on birth control', because that's all an excuse and now he has a responsibility, which if he doesn't meet, he's a pathetic deadbeat or a loser or scum.

It's as if people ""get"" the need for stigma and condemnation and even penalization with men, but for women it's a mystery. Even though, frankly, in the vast majority of cases it's the woman who is willfully deciding to kill her child.

&gt;Secondly, I wouldn't support the mother killing the baby. That we agree on. 

Well, if you were pro-choice - you say you're pro-life - my question would be, why is that list of mitigating factors seemingly grounds for sympathy or not even condemning the woman, much less punishing her, but 30 minutes after the American abortion deadline and the story changes?

It's one thing to recognize mitigating factors, which I did for the start. I can appreciate all kinds of complexities. But there is, in this pro-life movement, this certain terror that a woman who gets pregnant may feel bad, counterbalanced by an equal terror that a man who gets a woman pregnant will not. Insofar as the pro-life movement is also a movement about social and cultural change, that cannot go on.",2,1505773592,2017-09-18 18:26:32

334,"Firstly, I believe that the male should hold financial responsibility. If the baby is going for adoption, then neither parents hold financial responsibility. If the mother is keeping the baby, then if it was me in that situation, I would be obliged to support both the baby and the mother. If the mother refuses help from the father, or the father is abusive or dangerous, he shouldn't be allowed to have anything to do with the child. From a pro choice POV, some support the right for the father to have a ""financial abortion"", that is, to cut off financial support in the same way the mother could abort her child. I don't agree with that view. If the mother has to keep it and take responsibility, so should the father too. I personally think that the father should help support the child (or pay a certain amount, although hopefully not enough to bankrupt him either, which is one of the reasons in favour of a financial abortion) *at least* until the mother is capable of supporting the child properly or if she marries someone else who can support them. Much like your points and the entire abortion debate, this isn't necessarily a black and white situation.

Secondly, I wouldn't support the mother killing the baby. That we agree on. (Although I am pro life, I am still skeptical about many things such as the exact details of my position, in the same way I sometimes am with other things I am part of, such as Christianity). I'm just currently skeptical on giving her a 20 year prison sentence or as someone mentioned (might have been you but I'm not sure as mobile won't display the whole thread) the death penalty, and definitely against prosecuting anyone who has ever had an abortion, including some who do legitimately regret it,which have joined the pro life movement. I think the doctor should be punished somehow, but I am still skeptical on the mother, especially as certain circumstances regarding her situation must be taken into account. Although I think it is acceptable if the mother's life is at risk (i.e. uterine cancer or an exceptionally high chance of her death at birth), I am still undecided on unviable pregnancies, where the baby will either die at birth, or shortly after. 

I do think that support should be offered to women with unexpected pregnancies as well though, be it charity or government funding. If abortion is outlawed, I think the money previously spent on funding abortions should be used to support families with unexpected pregnancies, or used to fund charities that do those things, rather than just use that money on something else like the defence budget, which at least in the US, is high enough anyway (I'm not against the military in any way, although I believe that the money used in abortions could be spent better else where, what better place to put it is there than in pro life support charities?)",1,1505767585,2017-09-18 16:46:25

340,"&gt;Firstly, not everyone will wait until marriage for sex.

Not everyone will study in school, not everyone will save some money for emergencies, not everyone will make sure to fully cook food before eating it. Doesn't really matter to me or what I said.

And why do you assume that 'Christian morals' is operational here? I haven't cited Christian belief or teaching once, and wouldn't bother to. People can be accountable to themselves, they can make stupid choices, those choices can be discouraged. It's a tall order, but again, everything worth doing tends to be.

&gt;So punish anyone who gets pregnant.

No, since plenty of people manage to get pregnant in a stable relationship, intentionally or in a 'If it happens we'll be okay' way.

And the only punishment is a reasonable social stigma, and making it clear to people who end up pregnant/impregnating someone in that situation that yes, they made a stupid choice. They did.

&gt;You also assume that all sex is consensual.

First, in all of those scenarios, under what circumstances would you regard it as acceptable for the male responsible for the pregnancy to completely avoid any and all financial responsibility? Would 'This would hurt my career' excuse him?

Frankly, a lot of poor people - especially in the West - do not need money. They need guidance and oversight. A lack of actual cash is the least of their problems.

Only in the same way that any social standard encourages deceit among people with some severe flaws. Keep in mind that same stigma also (and history shows as much) does a bang-up job of keeping people out of that situation to begin with.

Regarding spousal abusers as rotten probably encourages certain kinds of people (monstrous ones) to both assault their spouses AND threaten them to keep their mouths shut.

375,"&gt;You say you ""don't believe in cruelty"". May I ask what you mean by that? What do you define as cruelty in this context?

Here? Cruelty is taking a mistake a person feels bad about and has made sincere steps to atone for, and grinding their face in it over and over again anyway. I oppose that.

I also oppose the (very common, even among pro-lifers) attitude that any negative feeling is 'cruelty'.

&gt;What do you mean by that? Does that mean not supporting women contemplating abortion by helping them be able to feed and actually support their child? 

It means not telling them that they did nothing wrong or they made a real easy mistake that shouldn't be held against them, that everything will be okay, and then trying to shield them from hardship. Even if they do it three more times and their attitude is ""Fuck you, I need money."" There should be stigma, there should be shame. There should be a way to get past these things and atone for them. But accepting that they are, in fact, things that need atoning for is necessary. (From the men as well, but everyone accepts THAT already. A woman who gets pregnant - even multiple times - out of wedlock, with no stability, due to her own free acts is an object of pity. A man is not - he is an object of scorn. That's life right now.)

I reject the pro-life hostage situation of 'We have to bribe these women or they will kill their children'. It doesn't work. It hasn't worked. It's resulted in vastly more out of wedlock pregnancies (which are a problem too), and more abortions too. And more than that, it misplaces the blame - and THAT is cruel too. 

A woman who aborts her kid because she really, really wants to finish her degree on time and maybe (maybe!) she wouldn't kill her kid if someone provided ample amounts of free child care while she finished up her last two years... she bears all the blame. For not cracking open my wallet, I bear none.

That doesn't mean I reject helping out. I believe people should be extremely charitable. I don't believe in trying to code charity into law. Partly because when you do that, it removes stigma in situations exactly like this.",1,1505667018,2017-09-17 12:50:18

400,"I don't know anything about Trump, so these are my own thoughts. 

1. Of course a mother should be punished if abortion is illegal and she chooses to do it. The doctor should as well. The same exceptions that would apply to any other murderer should apply to a mother that gets an abortion. Abortion isn't a special kind of homicide. 

2. You can't punish someone for their actions before a law was passed criminalizing it. Punishment should be the same as other forms of homicide. What would to do to someone that murdered their child? I'm an atheist, so I can't answer your forgiveness question besides saying that laws exist for a reason.

406,"Well the first thing, if I can be simple about it, is to ask those very questions.

I consider abortions to be horrendous, but I think if it can have any positive value, it will get us to ask those questions.

As for specifics, legislation and policy is insufficient, although certainly useful and even necessary.  So I'll talk about that second.

I think the most critical problem is that our culture does not value the care of children, especially in regard to the choices women have to make.  Women are expected to succeed at a career, and also deal with children.  They are also told very insistently that a child too early in their lives or at the wrong time will ruin their lives.

While women technically have a choice, it can take a considerable amount of effort to resist the default choice of career success.  

This also plays into the decisions we make about funding.  Would a girl feel scared by her pregnancy if she knew we had her back?  Not just monetarily, but with our time and our expectations of men as well?

So, I think the first change that needs to be made is cultural, and the way to do that is to construct a new understanding of motherhood as not a dire choice, but an honorable duty to our civilization.  Which, of course, it really is, if you think about it.

Policy wise, that means enacting protections and programs for women to provide support, but it also means taking an strong educational effort to change attitudes.  This does not have to be, and perhaps maybe even should not be a governmental activity, but it is important enough to consider carefully how we can get started as soon as possible.

Additionally, and this is very important too, we have to make the effort to educate everyone more on sex and how to prevent unplanned pregnancies.  While I am a religious person and I understand my Church's prohibition on things like prophylactic birth control, we should either concede on that matter provisionally, or make a strong case for how we deal with people who don't hold the same beliefs.  

I will say that I am wary of the Welfare State, as I tend to be fairly conservative financially.  However, conservative to me merely means supporting only the necessary services and not trying to make the government a one stop shop.  If we are honest with ourselves, we may be better off allowing the government to kick start programs and have a good plan to permit them to maintain themselves independently later on.  I think it is less important to get caught in the maze of financial politics than it is to get this done, but we should do it in a responsible manner.

Of course, none of this works if we lose the argument.  I'm not really a fan of Trump, honestly, and whether or not he comes through for the pro-life position, no one is going to lift a finger if we keep getting objections from mistaken feminists and conservatives who don't want to spend money.  We need to attach a proposal for how to help women to all of our arguments and make that a plank on any pro-life platform.

407,"As long as RoevWade stands the states can make *reasonable* health and saftey regulations. So unless the SCOTUS rule that every fetus is a person with inalienable right (ie unless they do a great deal more than simply overturn RoevWade) overturning it would simply return the responsibility for writing laws regarding abortion to the states. That is already effectively the case. Tennessee recently raised the regulatory bar high enough that the last abortion provider in the state folded and left. Abortions are still legal in Tennessee but the regulations are such that the business is unprofitable. A change in political fortunes could reverse these regulations or overturn them or as was the case with Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia, simply neglect to enforce them.   

If RoevWade were overturned it would simply become a state issue. Abortions would still be available in California, New York and other Progressive states. People would still be free to cross state lines to obtain them. Even if locally difficult to obtain, (say if local stores simply did not bother to stock them) birth control and morning after pills would still be available on the internet across state lines.

418,"&gt;How long in your opinion? Do you propose a £20 fine, or the next 30 years in prison or what?

Really depends on the circumstances, but 'years in prison' for some, 'none' for those who are physically forced or manipulated into an abortion ('Have this wine I spiked with an abortion-inducing drug.')

In most cases? Years is the right metric.

&gt;Also, since a good number of women get abortions at some point, dies that mean imprisoning a large proportion of the population?

I think you'll find that a combination of legal enforcement and social stigma will make that proportion drop like a rock. Once upon a time abortion was nearly unheard of in most of the west. That's what I work towards.

&gt;Firstly, not every woman who gets an abortion is a cold callous killer. Many feel trapped, or unready to have a baby.

Plenty of guys feel trapped in their marriage. Ask me what I think should be done if they kill their wife. Ask me if I think they should get a lesser sentence.

Feeling trapped doesn't excuse murder. A woman who is pregnant of her own free choices while lacking the support or will to have a child is in a bad situation of substantially her own making.

&gt;Most will do it because they have no support, or the father has abandoned her, or because of genuine psycological issues etc?

Frankly, the amount of support pregnant women - especially single moms - get in the west is overabundant. And most reasons are along the lines of 'Nah too expensive right now' or 'I don't think I'm ready for this'.

&gt;On that note, how do you propose to help pregnant women?

If she's single, pregnant, and lacks the proper support or capacity to raise a child? 

Let me be frank and say I don't think like many in r/prolife - I speak for myself, not others. But frankly, a woman in that situation of her own free choices has harmed people. She harms her community. She harms herself. She harms her child. I don't believe in hiding that fact. I don't believe that the goal is to make her feel as comfortable and happy as possible. If she made a stupid choice, she made a stupid choice. So did the idiot who got her pregnant, and who I think should be found and given the same treatment alongside her. (I wonder if anyone will speak up here and plea for the man's lack of wrong-doing, and be upset that this may ruin his life?)

That said, I also don't believe in cruelty. People make stupid choices in their lives. They should acknowledge them, and after having made up for them, be allowed to move on. Is this an easy balance to strike? Not always. But it has to be done. The answers of 'Kill your kid without remorse or stigma' and 'Please, you basically have a hostage, we'll make your life happy and care-free so long as you don't kill your kid' are unacceptable.",8,1505581862,2017-09-16 13:11:02
419,"I think it is important to state that while I believe that it would be desirable and that I am morally obligated to fight to make abortion illegal, I don't care about that as much as I just don't want abortions to be performed.

I tend to agree with the people who say that most punishment under the law is for the illegal practitioners of abortions.  Which is to say, I believe that there are circumstances of life and death where the woman does have a right to choose if her life is threatened.  In those cases, a trained doctor who is capable of doing an abortion is desirable.  

Such a doctor would need to be licensed and required to only perform life and limb saving procedures when a medical professional who is in charge of the woman's care has made a determination that the mother's life is threatened, and she has decided to terminate to save her own life.

The law would require that any abortion performed in any case be performed by a licensed doctor of the needed specialty (I hesitate to call them abortionists because I hope that that will cease being a full time job for doctors).  If the doctor fails to follow correct procedure, he or she is subject to malpractice, loss of license, and potentially charges of murder.  

Non-licensed abortionists would be charged with practicing without a license, and also, of course, murder or solicitation to commit murder.

What should happen to the mothers?  In many cases, mothers are acting in a manner which would suggest a very stressful situation.  If this is determined to be the case, the mother should be found not guilty by reason of reduced capacity to reason and taken under appropriate care.  I would suggest that the prosecutors in those cases work from the angle that the mother was generally under stress and work hard to not make the process require trial time or incarceration unless the mother has shown she is likely to repeat her attempts.  In that case, she migt be confined to the appropriate medical facilities involuntarily.  She may, also, be conditionally released as well, with the understanding that a further attempt to abort would be illegal and punishable as I mention below for certain other types of mothers.

However, what if we have a mother who insists that she can procreate with the intent to abort to make something like a political point, or she does not have any concern for responsibility what happens?

In those cases, one might argue that she is actually attempting murder.   But negligence and/or clear intent to show disregard for the law would be required.  In those cases, the woman would probably need to be jailed as for the appropriate crime (murder, attempted murder, etc.).

Personally, I know we're not going to be able to get between a child and a mother who does not want to carry the child.  There's little we can do about that, just like eradicating murder from the rest of the population doesn't seem likely.  

In the end, abortion is a human rights crisis made considerably worse because it is now legal and perhaps most disturbingly, that legality is based on declaring a biological human a ""non-person"" through no fault of the person who has been legally degraded in that manner.

I am not one for draconian or vengeful punishments for anyone, least of all mothers, and I hope we will take any opportunity that ending legalized abortion provides to make a case for better care and accommodation for women who have unplanned or inconvenient pregnancies.  I feel the state has a responsibility for moral, but also many practical reasons for protecting all humans, no matter what their stage of development.

Previously I worked for a mostly Latino Catholic parish as a youth minister. One day a week an abuelita and I would go down to the nearest abortion clinic. And in the spirit of a fair choice we offer whatever service the women felt like they needed to not end their children's life.

How is hypocritical? Abortion kills an innocent child, the death penalty kills a convicted murderer through justice. 

&gt; how would you show support to a pregnant woman contemplating abortion? Would you try to help her or anything, or leave her without any support like may pro life supporters allegedly do all too often?

I would show support by showing her that her child is a human being and directing her to a charitable prolife pregnancy center. 

To clarify against the argument ""If prolifers don't personally help pregnant women, they can't oppose abortion."" Charity is a great thing, but charity is not ""if you don't a potential criminal, they have free reign to commit a crime"". 

It would be like saying that you can't oppose parents murdering their born children without being willing to pay them to raise their kids.

I think are misrepresenting what Yesofcoursenaturally said. If she understands that having an abortion is murdering her unborn child, and does it, she *is* a killer.

434,"&gt;who would be punished here?

The person performing the abortion: the doctor. The mother is likely already in a stressful situation she just wants out of. She very likely doesn't have an intent, in her mind, that amounts to murder. The doctor, by comparison, knows exactly what they are doing.

&gt;How would they be punished?

Loss of their medical license. Fines. Jail. 

&gt;do you believe we should help women who have had abortions and regret it?

Yes, of course. It's a traumatic thing, a tragic situation. We should approach every woman who wants help with a spirit of grace and forgiveness. I can't *imagine* what's it's like to go through such a thing, so how can I possibly judge them?

&gt; does anyone have any idea or any rough statistics on how many pro lifers actually want to imprison women who have had an abortion

I would guess it's an *exceedingly* small number. Anecdotal, but I know and have heard from probably hundreds of pro-life individuals. I know of no one who wants to prosecute mothers. They are the victims, in a sense, of a society that tells them they will be happier if they do away with an unwanted pregnancy.

436,"Do you have a source for these Trump quotes? I've never heard of him saying this and I don't think it's true. 

---

My answers are my own, nothing to do with Trump: 

I would like to see abortion someday punished by the law for what it is: murder of an innocent child. 

&gt; Would you want to punish the doctor, or the mother

The priority would be making performing abortion illegal and punishing the doctors. 

At the current time, the problem with punishing women who obtain abortions is the sheer number of people who are ignorant of what an abortion actually is. Everyone understands what they are doing when they murder a born baby, but a lot of pro-choice people literally think that the unborn child is just a ""clump of cells"". Most women who get abortions don't have murderous intent. Abortion doctors are educated and see what they are doing. They are without excuse. 

Laws condemning abortion as the murder it is must be enacted and widely publicized so that everyone understands. 

I am seeing more and more pro-choicers who understand that abortion is murder, but still claim ""my body"" and the right to evict and kill their child. If any gets an abortion or pressures someone into getting an abortion, and has this understanding, they should be prosecuted by the full weight of murder. 

&gt; Would you prosecute someone who wasn't financially capable to have a baby, or the 13 year old barely-teenage girl with a small frame and thus a high risk pregnancy who was frightened and desperate, or the unwilling mother who's pregnancy is driving her to depression and near suicide? Or even a girl who was forced into an abortion?

I would have these cases treated the same as if they had killed their newborn baby. 

- Financial problems don't excuse murder. 

- Minors are usually held less accountable than adults, depending on circumstance (to clarify: in a high risk pregnancy, early delivery of the baby is justified if necessary to save the life of the mother, even if this risks the life of the child). 

- Depression usually does not reduce culpability for a crime unless it can be shown that the person did not understand what they were doing.

- Someone can't commit a crime if someone else forces them to do it against their will. 

&gt; On that note, do you believe we should help women who have had abortions and regret it?

At the current time, when many women don't understand that they are actually killing someone by getting an abortion, but learn afterwards, they shouldn't be punished as murderers. 

If she understands she is committing murder and regrets it afterwards, it should be treated as if she murdered her newborn and regretted it later. 

&gt; Should we help them and forgive them, or just shame them and lock them up?

Again, her culpability depends on her understanding. 

Those are not mutually exclusive options. You can lock up a murderer because it is just punishment and to protect society, while also forgiving and helping him. 

&gt; I know that in the Bible, Paul...

Something that happens in the Bible doesn't mean it is condoned, it's just describing reality. Saul was a powerful man as both Roman citizen and Pharisee. The earliest Christians were not. St. Stephen was stoned by the mob, but no one who mattered cared, so justice didn't happen. 

It's a great thing that Paul was converted and repented despite not receiving justice for his actions. 

&gt; but I am currently having trouble seeing how you show compassion by wanting to put someone under lock-and-key for the next 20 years.

Again, think about it as killing a newborn. Showing compassion isn't exclusive from punishing a terrible crime.  20 years isn't enough. Life in prison or death would be more appropriate. ",5,1505576007,2017-09-16 11:33:27
437,"Would any ""pro-choicers"" like to weigh in on why this is ok? If it really was about choice, there would be just as much support behind abortion reversal as there is for abortion. ",4,1505575437,2017-09-16 11:23:57
438,"&gt;who would be punished here? Would you want to punish the doctor, or the mother, or what?

Mother, doctor, anyone taking part in the abortion.

&gt;Also, regarding the mother, under what circumstances would you want to prosecute her? Would you prosecute someone who wasn't financially capable to have a baby, or the 13 year old barely-teenage girl with a small frame and thus a high risk pregnancy who was frightened and desperate, or the unwilling mother who's pregnancy is driving her to depression and near suicide? Or even a girl who was forced into an abortion?

If you're literally forced into an abortion, you're not culpable.

If you're under the age of consent or, frankly, reasoning, then that's a mitigating factor.

If you're a 20-something woman who didn't want her trip to the Bahamas interrupted, the book should be thrown at you.

&gt;How would they be punished? If you wanted to make abortion illegal, would you go and prosecute every woman who has ever had an abortion? On that note- how would you punish them? 

Retroactive prosecution wouldn't be feasible nor wise.

Otherwise? Fines and some amount of prison time, with the usual variance depending on the circumstances.

&gt;Many can argue that pro life supporters have no compassion. Some pro lifers say they do have compassion for women, but I am currently having trouble seeing how you show compassion by wanting to put someone under lock-and-key for the next 20 years. 

They have more compassion than mothers who kill their children, especially those conceived of their own free actions, and killed for altogether meager reasons.

That said, 20 years? I don't think people have even begun to suss out a proper prison sentence for this kind of thing, and given how the situations can vary, it's hard to put a serious number on it.

I want to stress though: this is about regarding a child as a human being worthy of life, respecting all life, and thus treating the intention destruction of that life as a crime. To be at all sincere about this means laws, and for any law against a crime (especially a grotesque one) to be sincere, punishment is needed. That is simple justice.

Does that mean intentionally, gleefully making life miserable for the 13 year old thrice-raped girl who was forced to get an abortion at shotgun point? No. There's obvious variance between circumstances, and this is understood with just about every law we pass, and every sentence handed down.

Children in the womb are human beings. They deserve to life. Killing them is a cruel act, a heartless and vicious one. It is murder. We treat it accordingly, weighing all the  circumstances of it.

You'll find that some pro-lifers are allergic to this kind of reasoning, and say every single woman who gets an abortion is a victim (and also every single (female!) abortionist is deluded and not culpable.) I disagree. In fact, I think any sincere pro-lifer must disagree. Sometimes, children die, and the people who kill them deserve punishment.

Wanting justice for the slaughtered is not heartless. It is noble.

And as for women who come to regret abortion: that is great, and they should be encouraged. But we should not pretend that they did not, in fact, kill their child. That is precisely what they regret.",4,1505574489,2017-09-16 11:08:09

2. When the fertilization is complete, it results in a new, genetically distinct organism.

441,"When a sperm fertilizes an egg, their nuclei fuse. The cell organelles and pre-made mRNA of the egg are used to get the ball rolling prior to implantation. The rest of the sperm is usually lost (mitochondria, flagellum, etc.).

While you might be able to get away with ""fertilized egg"" to describe an egg that has been penetrated but in which the nuclei haven't fused yet, once they fuse, it is no longer the woman's egg but the embryo's zygote. This is a technicality and many will still (incorrectly) say fertilized egg when describing the process apolitically.

442,"I'm very against it for the whole ""value of life"" thing, but also consider that many attempts are not successful and wind up causing permanent damage that the person has to live with once they no longer feel suicidal.  I know someone who has firsthand experience with a method that was ""guaranteed to work irreversibly"" but only resulted in an immune disorder that has to be lived with now that the suicidal phase has passed.

Furthermore, many suicide attempts are influenced by mental illness which pretty much by definition distorts the reality of someone's situation.  I'm not willing to let mentally ill people decide when their life is worth ending because they're not capable of making a sound judgement on the matter. Hence why the cops are called - maybe there's a study out there that tracks the long term happiness of people saved from suicide attempts so we can have a data driven discussion about the merits of getting people through suicidal phases. 

I'm borderline pro-choice only in cases of euthanasia due to painful terminal illnesses.  What gives me hesitation is the slippery slope that leads to eugenics and ""over-prescription"" in cases that don't quite merit suicide. I get that there are cases where even the most extreme painkillers can't alleviate the excruciating final stages of a disease but perhaps severing nerves can work as a less slippery alternative to euthanasia.

446,"I strongly urge you to revisit what you read about the prolife response to Trump's very short-lived position on abortion. Please let me help you put it in context. 

Before 2016, Trump was pro-choice. Perhaps he had some kind of epiphany... or perhaps he just realized you can't be a GOP presidential nominee and be pro-choice. 

Mr. Trump was under questioning from Chris Matthews, a liberal, who wasn't going to let him off the hook. Trump was waffling--again, because he never had been prolife and couldn't articulate a position that was entirely new to him. Under those circumstances, off the cuff, Trump said something that he probably thought the hard-line base would be into. 

The backlash from the prolife movement was immediate and severe, and Trump immediately recanted after the sheer volume of condemnation from prolifers. Even Ted Cruz thought that was nuts. Ted Cruz. (Whatever you may think of him, he isn't a moderate anything.)

Again, I strongly urge you to continue reading mainstream news coverage on what happened in 2016 with Trump's comments. A man with almost no connection to the prolife movement made a comment that was swiftly and universally condemned and recanted. There is no metric by which that remark could be considered mainstream.

451,"The main issue here is scientific/ exact terms versus common usage. 

Scientifically speaking, fertilization is when the sperm penetrates the egg cell's membrane. Then, a zygote/ embryo/ human is formed when the DNA within each of the two gametes joins together to form a single cell. A new human being is formed from the new genetic material in the joining of the two gametes—gametes are not humans, but they are human cells: a living fragment of a human. A sperm cell attached to an egg cell is not a human—there has been no exchange of DNA to form a new living being. However, and the end of the process of conception, the zygote is completely human—they have their own genetic code, their own cell autonomy, and all the genetic information necessary to replicate and create an adult human being (like an infant or a five year old). 

Now, let's get into more scientific definitions. Life is currently defined as when something has these markers; it can maintain homeostasis, is composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, can adapt to their environment, can respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An organism is an individual entity that is alive (as defined above). So all organisms are alive, but not everything that is alive is an organism..... it depends both on totality (is it a whole entity) and individuality (is it unique in its genetic coding, and controlled as a separate entity). 

The pro-life stance states that not only are zygotes/ embryos/ fetuses alive (no one really disagrees with this premise), but also that they're an organism of themselves—a complete, unique human being, deserving of all the rights humanity conveys. ",5,1505535162,2017-09-16 00:12:42

475,"Every human life has inherent worth given by God. No one gives or takes it away. It is not dependent on our abilities, experiences, or subjective judgment by others or ourselves. 

Killing is only justified in defense of life, like to protect yourself or family or in the death penalty for a murderer. Even when it is justified, it is still a bad thing. Suicide is not a justified killing. 

I'm sorry that you are feeling suicidal. Despair is a terrible place to be. I truly believe that your life is worthy despite whatever you are going through. Would you be ok with it if I said a prayer for you? ",3,1505506190,2017-09-15 16:09:50

482,"My wife is pro-choice.  I've talked to her about it, but it doesn't really impact our relationship in any direct way.  Part of it is that we take care to not have unintended pregnancies, and I guess we can call that now successful as we're getting older and pregnancy is not likely anymore in any case for various reasons.

Also, I don't believe she would actually get an abortion, she just supports the abstract right of choosing.  It would be much harder to tolerate if I felt it was something she would actually do herself.

The key thing to remember about most pro-choice people is that they probably would have been pro-life when the cultural thrust was against abortion.  Many people don't fully internalize what things like that mean, they just don't want to be seen as getting in people's business and somehow interfering with their rights, and the pro-choice movement has done an excellent job at making killing people seem empowering.  

As for OkCupid, I am upset that they are doing this, especially since everyone talks about how bubbles hurt our discourse, but these commercial entities just keep doing it because it serves their purposes to keep people separated into camps.

483,"&gt; Don't be all 'hoorah hoora adoption exists suckas' if you're not going to adopt a kid.

So what are you trying to say? It's better to kill them, than to make them wait for adoption?

As it happens, I personally know *half a dozen* couples who have gone through or are going through the adoption process. In most cases, though, they are not adopting children (yes, *children*, not babies) from the U.S. They have to go overseas to places like China or the Ukraine. 

Why? There really aren't that many kids available here. Unwanted babies in the U.S. typically get aborted.

And children in the foster system are another story altogether. They typically come from broken homes and may or may not go back to their birth parents. Because of the legal entanglements, they are much harder to fully adopt.

So there are lots of willing people willing to adopt. But the supply of children is limited.",1,1505500888,2017-09-15 14:41:28

485,"&gt; But being pregnant and having a child is often so burdensome for women precisely because our social structures have been designed by and for human beings who cannot get pregnant.

But this is just the hardcore *feminist* view of ""equality"": being 'equal' to the men, emulate men...

In fact: Phyllis Schlafly argued against the feminist Equal Rights Amendment on the grounds that equating women with men would eliminate special rights and exemptions of women (like receiving alimony of a dead husband, military drafting etc.).

&gt;  but the idea that men expect women to get abortions as a necessary component of their sexual lifestyle is hardly new

Again, a bad fruit of the ""my body my choice"" reasoning of the current feminist mood: ""your body, your choice, your responsibility"". It is hard to escape that conclusion. If the mother has every legal right to avoid her parental responsibilities, why the same doesn't apply to men?",4,1505498475,2017-09-15 14:01:15
486,"&gt; Except men consistently are more in favour of Abortion than women according to opinion polls.

Yes, because they are teached by the culture and laws that being a good, law-abiding person is stupidity.

A not so long time ago, *Casey v. PP* ruled that the father has absolutely no rights above his unborn children. If the law has some teaching aspect, it is teaching that men have no reproductive rights.

Also, *Hermesmann v. Seyer* rules that, even in the case an older woman rapes a young teenager and becomes pregnant as a result, she can sue the boy for child support. If the law has some teaching aspect, it is teaching that men have heavy reproductive dutiues (even if involuntary).

This 100%. I really wish more people went with this. Its more feminist to allow women every opportunity to succeed despite a pregnancy, not by ending it.

The individual mandate would be scrapped and replaced with a waiting period if you go without insurance, before you get it again. If that ends up not killing the exchanges (driving premiums sky high) it'll be a big win for the Republicans.

Also, cutting Medicaid is a terrible idea. The more conservative Republicans should be thanking Jesus right now that there aren't enough of them to cram that through, else we'd be looking at Democratic landslides in coming elections.

Defunding Planned Parenthood is unpopular with a majority of Americans (according to polls) - but it's VERY popular with most Republican voters, and (I think) once more people learn that there actually are good alternatives to Planned Parenthood (and if the additional funding in this bill for community health clinics comes close to what Planned Parenthood receives) it might become more popular. It's also only for one year, which is actually a good thing, I think (speaking as someone who is pro-life) because if it was permanent, now, Planned Parenthood supporters would resort to more scorched earth tactics.

---

&gt; I find it hard to believe that these cases are anything but poor excuses to argue for unrestricted late-term abortion access.

Most of pro-choice don't actually want unrestricted late-term abortion access, they only want it to be available in specific cases.

&gt; Although the vast majority of states restrict later-term abortions, many of these restrictions have been struck down. Most often, courts have voided the limitations **because they do not contain a health exception;** contain an **unacceptably narrow health exception;** or do not permit a physician to **determine viability in each individual case,** but rather rely on a rigid construct based on specific weeks of gestation or trimester.

The best way to actually prevent unrestricted late term abortions is to limit it by good laws that will not be struck down because they are too restrictive.

For example, only 13 states require that a second physician attend the procedure to treat a fetus if it is born alive in all or some circumstances.

IMHO, that should be standard for late-term abortion where there is a possibility of a live birth.",1,1501038205,2017-07-25 23:03:25

Except it doesn't because ""seriously ill"" is vastly different from ""terminally ill/vegetative"", especially when an exact prognosis (in the case of Trisomy 18) is difficult to determine prenatally.

Furthermore, at least one study shows a [9.8% 10-year survival rate](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2536636) for Trisomy 18 thanks to the availability of surgical intervention, and a typically rapid death otherwise.  Abortion is hardly a ""mercy kill"" in this case.

Maybe there's actual cut and dry cases where there's no doubt that the fetus is not alive, in which case aborting the pregnancy doesn't actually end a life.

Contempt of court, often referred to simply as ""contempt"", is the offence of being disobedient to or discourteous towards a court of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority, justice and dignity of the court. It manifests itself in willful disregard of or disrespect for the authority of a court of law, which is often behavior that is illegal because it does not obey or respect the rules of a law court.

There are broadly two categories of contempt: being rude or disrespectful to legal authorities in the courtroom, or wilfully failing to obey a court order. Contempt proceedings are especially used to enforce equitable remedies, such as injunctions.

192,"&gt; My point is that an abortion is not a procedure necessary for the health of the mother unless the pregnancy is disordered such that it damages the mother in some way.

Right, I think I said as much at the end of my comment. 

&gt;But the normal natural things that happen to the mother's body are not disordered.

Depends on how you define ""disordered."" I guess something ""normal"" and ""natural"" can still be very damaging. Honestly, I think using these terms is more harmful/confusing than helpful. And they tend to minimize what women go through in ""natural"" pregnancies. 

&gt;And that is because it is totally healthy to be pregnant.

Again, I would take a second to think about what you're saying. Because a ""natural"" and ""healthy"" pregnancy can still involve, for example, vomiting every day multiple times a day for months. There is basically no health advantage to this (and in fact it is damaging to her health), but it's part of ""normal"" pregnancies. 

&gt;Self-defense does not work when we are talking about the probability of the event being a threat. It would seem to me killing in self-defense is only justified when the threat is immediate and relatively obvious.

Well tbh the only conditions I know of that require abortion are ectopic pregnancies. Later-term threats, like eclampsia, are relieved by delivery, not abortion. 

I suppose there are some circumstances where a pregnancy can be of grave threat to a woman do to *other* conditions she has (such as kidney or heart problems). I am not aware of any that would require an abortion, though, as opposed to (as I said before) just watchful following.

198,"**2009 Brazilian girl abortion case**

In 2009, a nine-year-old Brazilian girl became pregnant with twins. The girl's mother obtained an abortion for the girl and, afterward, Archbishop José Sobrinho said that automatic excommunication applied to the girl's mother and to the doctors who performed the abortion, prompting national and international criticism. In response, the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared that no one was excommunicated in the case, and in an article published on L'Osservatore Romano a Vatican bioethicist rebuked the archbishop for his public statement.

201,"My point is that an abortion is not a procedure necessary for the health of the mother unless the pregnancy is disordered such that it damages the mother in some way. But the normal natural things that happen to the mother's body are not disordered. A normal natural pregnancy is a healthy state and states which are part of a healthy state cannot be a health threat by definition.

So it doesn't make sense for the mother to be justified in killing the unborn child on the grounds that it is threatening her health if that pregnancy is normal. And that is because it is totally healthy to be pregnant.

The issue is rather if the mother is justified in killing her unborn child on the grounds that there is a risk that her pregnancy won't turn out to be a healthy one. Most people agree the self-defense justification works out for cases where the pregnancy is disordered such that it threatens the immediate life of the mother.

Self-defense does not work when we are talking about the probability of the event being a threat. It would seem to me killing in self-defense is only justified when the threat is immediate and relatively obvious. So for that reason abortion would not be justified even in the areas where maternal mortality is high. And if the maternal mortality rate is so high that it would constitute an immediate threat to the life of the mother then that hypothetical world has bigger problems than abortion and their lineage would likely die out.",1,1500854832,2017-07-23 20:07:12

As someone who works in the medical field, it doesn't seem odd to me at all. Yes, our bodies evolved to make more human beings inside them -- so our species could survive. And it did a sufficient job to allow that to occur. But maternal mortality in pregnancy/childbirth is, without modern medicine, *very high*. 

So just because our bodies are ""designed"" to have babies doesn't mean it's perfect. It's far from it. 

As far as the ""welcoming in"" stuff -- it's complicated. Some damage is from what you might call over-welcoming (i.e. when pregnant, the fetus essentially takes everything as a first priority; it takes all the nutrients, it even sucks calcium straight off your bones, and if any of this is too much for the mother, tough luck because it's going to happen without outside intervention). 

Some damage is from the body responding to the fetus like an antigen (i.e. Rh-negative mothers become Rh-sensitized and attacking the fetus). 

And some damage is just from the process not going perfectly. For example pre-eclampsia, when the spiral arteries in the placenta don't form correctly and the fetus can't get proper blood flow, the mother's BP increases, and it can lead to seizures in mom and death in the child. This is deadly without prompt delivery. Then there's things like placenta previa. Anyway my point is complications in pregnancy happen *a lot*.

So for pro-choicers to argue that an abortion is self-defense, well, I can kind of see their point. I think it would be naive and unwise to deny the many and sometimes very severe risks or pregnancy.

&gt;The reason the warrant isn't there is because it is healthy for the woman's body to change to be receptive to the unborn child save for pregnancy disorders where the mother's body isn't receptive and may turn out to be harmful.

Which is *many* pregnancies. And pro-choicers don't like to take those odds. I would argue that we live in an advanced enough country (most of us do) that it is *completely reasonable* to wait for some level of medical certainty that an abortion is warranted. There is no reason to use abortion as prophylaxis. Pregnancies can be reliably followed, and complications can often be managed well. If they can't, and abortion is necessary, that's another story.

211,"I would say they are two different issues. Of course a soldier could murder during war but not all killing of innocents in war is murder. Other facts have to be taken into account to decide what is just in war. It seems to me that in war there are extra morally relevant considerations hanging about that could shift a killing of innocent outside of a war into something more acceptable if it is done during a war. But, again, that doesn't mean murders cannot happen in war, only that other factors matter in that circumstance.",1,1500834857,2017-07-23 14:34:17
212,"&gt; The problem is many pro-choicers would argue that abortion is ""self-defense"" since any pregnancy is a medical threat to the mother's health in some form or another (minor or major). However I would argue that this need for self-defense is not high enough to warrant taking another life.

It seems odd to me to equate something that is totally normal and by design as a health threat. One way to make sense of it might be to think of the way a fever can become a health threat. A fever would be the body doing what it was designed to do. In most cases it seems to me that lowering a fever would be the unhealthy thing to do save for instance of autoimmune disorders or allergy. This is even a stretch because in a fever/allergy it is the body responding against a pathogen/antigen where in pregnancy the body is receptive to the unborn child. The change is not against but is welcoming her in. What would be unhealthy in pregnancy is if the woman's body didn't respond receptively.

But I think your reason here that ""this need for self-defense is not high enough to warrant taking another life"" converges with what I have described here. The reason the warrant isn't there is because it is healthy for the woman's body to change to be receptive to the unborn child save for pregnancy disorders where the mother's body isn't receptive and may turn out to be harmful.

&gt; Obviously this has a lot of holes, since if we allowed the killing of human beings people didn't find valuable, it would lead to killing of disabled, maybe even entire racial groups. It's a horrible basis for human rights.

The problem goes both ways. Human being = moral person results in too wide of a category while moral person = conscience being results in too narrow of a category. Most pro-choice criteria would not lead to a slippery slope of killing off racial groups but some of them do result in saying it is OK to kill off the disabled (including really young, healthy infants like newborns, tooley and singer).",2,1500834615,2017-07-23 14:30:15

214,"&gt; A person must not be forced to give up control of their organs for the life of another regardless of their innocence.

It may be true as far as it goes. But it is not a matter of settled debate that a woman owns her body in pregnancy. A case can be made that the mother-child relationship is analogous to the relationship of two healthy and functioning conjoined twins. Intuitively people recognize that in this case one twin has no more power than the other in their desires to be pulled apart especially when one of their lives is on the line.

&gt; Sometimes innocent people need to die for the rest of us to live civilized lives.

That's a good rallying principle for the genocide of innocents. It would have played well with the Nazis. Anyway, to avoid the accusation of an ad hiterlum I will just go ahead and refute this statement by showing that it is incoherent.

A civilized life is one that is not earned through the killing of innocents by definition. This is because a morally wise, civilized person would recognize that lifting himself up by killing innocents is not a civilized up. It is a down.

So your statement is nonsense. A contradiction in terms.",3,1500833685,2017-07-23 14:14:45
215,"I think the analogy should be put the following way.

A woman buys food at the grocery store with SNAP and uses cash to buy headache medicine at the same grocery store.

Proposition A: The woman is using food stamps to buy headache medicine.

False A: The woman is using money she got elsewhere which is not directed at anything specific.

True A: The woman would not have been able to buy headache medicine and food at the same time so the money which may have been used for food is instead used for headache medicine.

Notice for 'True A' food is prior in importance to headache medicine. Therefore, even though the proposition is true in this sense it is not a very important sense of the word ""use"" because food is more important than headache medicine.

A woman buys an STD test at PP with medicaid and uses cash to buy an abortion at the same PP.

Proposition B: The woman is using federal money to buy an abortion.

False B: The woman is using money she got elsewhere which is not directed at anything specific.

True B: The woman would not have been able to buy an abortion and an STD test at the same time so the money which may have been used for an STD test is instead used for an abortion.

Notice for 'True B' an abortion is not prior in importance to an STD test or other women's health excluding abortion. So this is where the analogy breaks down and the issue shifts to whether or not abortion is prior in importance to all the other healthcare that PP could offer.

The Hyde amendment stipulates that ""the prohibitions in this bill, and current prohibitions, do not apply to abortions in cases of rape or incest, or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed."" So the Hyde amendment seems to not apply when health depends on having an abortion and therefore affirming that health is prior in importance to abortion where it concerns women's healthcare.

So I would say that the analogies work if the sense of ""use"" makes both propositions A and B false but the analogy breaks down when considering the sense in which propositions A and B are true.

Someone might object that the Hyde amendment should be interpreted in light of the sense where propositions A and B are both false but I don't see any reason to interpret it that way other than the above argument by analogy which I just refuted.",1,1500832445,2017-07-23 13:54:05

In 2015, an anti-abortion organization named the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released several videos that had been secretly recorded. Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a biotechnology company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities. The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal tissue available to researchers, although no problems were found with the legality of the process.

All of the videos were found to be altered, according to analysis by Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn R. Simpson, a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal.

***

**Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy: Investigations**

Responding to the videos and to CMP's claims, three different congressional committees, and officials in a number of states, launched investigations into Planned Parenthood's tissue collection activities. One Congressional committee asked to interview the filmed representatives to see whether the statements made in the videos are consistent with existing federal law. On July 30, 2015, Indiana Governor Mike Pence announced that the state's investigation did not find any evidence of wrongdoing in Planned Parenthood's handling of fetal tissue. In Massachusetts, where there is no fetal tissue and organ donation program, Attorney General Maura Healey found that aborted fetuses are disposed of properly in a report that ""voiced strong support for"" Planned Parenthood.

295,"&gt;He can argue that abortion ""kills"" a human, but not that it specifically ""murders"" a human.

This fails, though, because murder and manslaughter are determined by intent. If you intended to kill a human life, it's murder, an immoral act. If you didn't intend to, it's manslaughter, at minimum an amoral act. Abortion is murder because the woman and her doctor both intended to kill the child. If they didn't, and the child still died, it would be considered a miscarriage, which is tragic but obviously not immoral. 

""But not all immoral acts are unlawful acts"" might be the reply, but abortion must be made unlawful because one of the primary purposes of the state is the protection of its citizens. Just as a parent who abuses their child has forfeited their authority over the child, so too if the state condones the murder of its own citizens, it loses its authority and reason for being. Moreover, all positive law is based on the natural law, such that the distinction between ""immoral"" and ""unlawful"" is, at bottom, a false one, but that would be an even longer digression, so I'll leave it at that.

The billionaire family already gives money to some of the largest abortion chains in the world, including Planned Parenthood and Marie Stopes International.” LifeNews went on to explain that “the fungibility of money makes it easier for pro-abortion organizations to provide abortion internationally.

&gt; A former state court official and a counselor for pregnant women today criticized an Alabama court ruling allowing a 12-year-old girl who was raped by an adult relative to have an abortion without parental consent.

&gt; Last week, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals upheld a juvenile court&amp;#039;s ruling that the girl&amp;#039;s horrific circumstances warranted allowing a waiver to the requirement for parental consent for a minor to have an abortion.

356,"&gt;we can do things to reduce the number of women
&gt;getting hurt in abortions without condoning or
&gt;allowing abortions (I assume you agree). 

I do agree...The government should not be condoning behavior (like abortion) that encourages people to view human life as less-than-sacred. They shouldn't be encouraging it, subsidizing it, or supporting abortion in any way. It should be illegal if there is any chance at all the fetus could survive outside of the womb - unless it it is quite likely the mother could lose her life if her pregnancy continues. And at the same time, it needs to be recognized that some women are still going to seek out abortions even if/when it is illegal, and it's in the state's interest - and it is the morally right thing to do - to try to prevent women, even though they choose to violate the law from dying or injuring themselves severely.

&gt; making contraception accessible and free


I do not think free birth control would lesson the rate of abortion, and I do not think the government should have anything to do with contraception. Contraception encourages people to view sexuality as something that exists merely so that people can get pleasure from it. Rather than promoting a view of sexuality that goes against thousands of years of religious teaching, the state should rather encourage people to put off having sex until they are married - and end policies that effectively encourage people to have sex outside of committed relationships.

Thompson makes the case that, since it's your carpet, you can kill the people who sprout up. However, since the only justificatory factor is that you own the carpet, then it would also be morally permissible to purposely plant people seeds and kill them just for kicks. Since this seems morally abhorrent, this line of argument doesn't seem to really capture the grounds on which you can legitimately kill someone. Simply put, it's morally significant whether someone is violating your rights intentionally or not.

If the fact the woman is causally responsible for the child being inside of her and needing specifically her is not sufficient to oblige her to provide the necessary care, then by parity of reasoning the man being causally responsible for the child is not sufficient to oblige him to pay financial support.

Pro-choicers wouldn't like that because it would have obvious negative consequences for single mothers.

If the man's causal responsibility is enough to oblige him to care in some way for the child then *a fortiori* so it is for the woman as well. But in order to maintain the bodily autonomy argument for abortion pro-choicers have to deal with the responsibility objection.

372,"&gt;It could be argued that if the defunding of PP didn't happen, the long term trend (a declining rate) would have happened instead of the increase, because the status quo was maintained.

Even if that's true though this study isn't any kind of slam dunk against pro-lifers that pro-choicers are portraying it as. From what I can tell by Figure 7 it appears the teen abortion rate from 2013-14 fell faster than it did in previous years. Defunding PP may not have contributed to that, or it may have. But either way, pro-life efforts against PP don't cause a sustained increase in the teen abortion rate or an increase at all in the overall abortion rate. 

But I think this study is pretty weak for only looking at the teen abortion rate. Teens make up a small minority of all TX abortions. If you want to get a more complete picture of the effects of defunding PP, the study should have included women ages 20-29 since they make up a larger chunk of both PP patients and they make up a *much* bigger percentage TX abortions (58% for women in their twenties and 11% for teens). And both the CDC and the Texas health department break down the number of abortions that occur among this age group so the author could have included this if she wanted to, but my guess is she didn't because the abortion rates for this group didn't increase.

But that supposes that there is nothing wrong with contraception. And a lot of people - myself included - would disagree with that. Not because we don't believe it prevents abortion - although the evidence there isn't as clear-cut as many people seem to think. But rather because we believe that it hurts relationships.

For some individuals - me, for one (and probably Obianuju Ekeocha, for another, based on what she says in this video) - the objection is grounded in religious belief. The Catholic Church has always opposed contraception.

401,"&gt; I honestly can't think of any real world scenario, that is similar to abortion that happens more often. 

I don't see why the frequency would have any moral relevancy?

&gt;And any hypothetical situation I've ever heard of is so contriveed that it is useless. 

And yet prochoicers have no problem using the violinist example to demonstrate a point. Seems like a double standard to me. 

&gt;Also abortion is a very real thing, most people probably know someone who has had one, and everyone probably knows someone who has been pregnant so it isn't a far fetched scenario in the first place. 

Again, I'm not sure how this is relevant?

&gt;So I think people are familiar enough with abortion that we don't need to create an extra scenario to catch someone who might have a slightly inconsistent set of values. 

That's how ethical philosophy works. We uses reason and logic to derive a system that is consistent. Any other method is purely subjective and emotional. It seems like you don't like this system precisely because it brings your inconsistencies to light. 

&gt;All that matters even does is let them know that their values are inconsistent, it doesn't make them wrong. 

Yes it tells them their view is logically inconsistent and thus based on emotional responses rather than any system of reason.
 
&gt;It's an emotional issue, not a logical one, 

It's the exact opposite actually. Using logic and reason to weed out a system of ethics is an attempt at an objective view. Just saying, I think it is so is the emotional avenue.

&gt;if I say I'm pro choice because of bodily autonomy and also think that vaccinations should be mandatory, you might point out that that is in consistent, and I could just agree with you, 

Actually I don't necessarily think that is inconsistent. In fact I think the analogy fails in many ways. The trick is to focus on an analogy that is almost similar in every moral way to the state of the pregnant mother and human fetus/preborn child. 

&gt;but I probably won't change my mind. 

Maybe not. It is up to each person to dig deeper or remain satisfied with their thoughtlessness and cognitive dissonance.

&gt;This logical derivation stuff that is so popular is only really necessary when you have a common issue and you want to applies the rule from that to a similar but uncommon issue that you might not understand, 

And there are common issues that are strongly analogous to abortion. Parental responsibility laws and conjoined twins are two great candidates.

&gt;however, abortion/pregnancy is common and fairly understandable issue, and while plenty of people on both sides don't understand things and can have their minds changed, there are plenty of other people who do fully understand what they are advocating and continue to do so.

Sure. There are all different kinds of people with many different opinions. That will most likely never change. But if prochoicers insists on avoiding the logical reasoning necessary to examine the issue they definitely won't be changing my mind and I imagine most people who are prolife or intelligent people sitting on the fence.
 
&gt; If I just say, well I thought about it, and I don't see a problem with it, or I thought about it and I think it's wrong. That's all there is to it.

Perhaps that's all there is to it for you. Others are not so simple minded and actually see the good in challenging and rethinking their positions. It's called open dialogue. 

I've notice a trend of prochoicers evading questions and running from conversations that are not going their way. This is why I always say that the prochoice rhetoric is generally based on emotion and not logical reasoning.  

This is why I remain steadfastly prolife. I tend to value logic and reason over feelings and emotion. ",2,1500406395,2017-07-18 15:33:15

404,"Disclaimer: I'm Catholic and, therefore, not pro-birth control. I am not opposed to women having access to birth control, but I'd like you to consider something about the above argument.

The woman in the video runs a campaign against western organizations bringing abortion and abortion ideologies to Africa even though much of Africa is opposed. Part of the core of pro-choice ideologies is that women should be able to have sex without any possibility of pregnancy whatsoever. Part of this mentality in the West began with contraception and its promise of baby-free sex; in fact, part of the reasoning behind Roe v. Wade was that society had become accustomed to the idea that sex does not have to lead to procreation, and that abortion was necessary as a backup if contraception should fail. For the reasoning behind the opposition to bringing contraception into a society, see Janet Smith's ""Contraception: Why Not?""

So basically, I am totally fine with anyone who is pro-life and pro-contraception as long as we as a society acknowledge the real possibility that contraception could fail and pregnancy could occur, and that there isn't another way out at that point.

The problem with the ""ideological colonization"" described here in terms of life issues is that women in many places in Africa simply don't view pregnancy in the same way we do here. Birth is considered to be an overwhelmingly positive experience. Children are a chance to help a family gather resources, not a sentence to lifelong poverty, as the pro-choice mentality tends to treat them.

So, basically, even if you believe that women should have access to contraception--and I have no problem with that--bringing the Western mindset of children as a burden to countries that value life can really only hurt in the long run. The birth control itself isn't necessarily the problem; the population-control ideology and pressure to use birth control is.",11,1500388070,2017-07-18 10:27:50

408,"**Birth control**

Birth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.

Contraception has been around since the Ancient Egyptians (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control). The [Malthusian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_League) were campaigning for it in the 19th century, well before the Sexual Revolution. ",6,1500371686,2017-07-18 05:54:46

However, by claiming that healthcare for example is a human right, the UN contradicts the right to property because healthcare entails the labor of another person (a doctor). One's labor is part of one's property. So the right to healthcare, by demanding the use of someone else's labor, contradicts the right to property. The difference between the two ""human rights"" is that your right to property means that nobody else can decide what you do with your property, as long as it doesn't encroach on other people's rights, where as the right to healthcare means that someone else's property belongs to you if you are in need of it.

- The type of contraception she mentions (IUDs) can cause the death of an unborn baby by preventing implantation if fertilization occurs. In this case they don't prevent abortions, but cause them. 

- If an embryo does manage to implant while IUD is inserted, it's more likely to be ectopic, meaning that either the baby or both mother and baby will die. 

- The idea that contraception of any kind is an acceptable, moral, and expected part of life and society is very recent and limited to liberal, secular, western ideology after the sexual revolution. Reasons for this include: it's wrong to have sex while rejecting its natural procreative purpose, contraception encourages people to have casual sex and expect no children as the norm and this cultural change increases abortion. Women from African countries disapprove morally of contraception compared to views in western countries so when western organizations insist on bringing contraception (and worse, abortion) under the guise of ""healthcare"", it's met with justified rejection.

Right but the point is they're analogous in the way that matters: using body parts.

I agree that this is the crutch of the argument. I think it breaks down though when a prochoicers is asked whether they would apply the same reasoning in like moral situations. Suddenly it is apparent that it's not about bodily autonomy anymore but rather, the fact that they do not view the fetus as equal to or worthy of the same rights as the mother.

453,"I'd probably answer two ways. 

First, I'd bring up the fact that conjoined twins can NOT kill each other on demand and without apology.

Second, I'd bring up the notion of parental responsibility. I'd explain that rights and responsibilities are tied together and that there are many instances where a person has to bear the consequences (however burdensome) for their actions. For example, I have the right to drink alcohol but if I hit someone while over the limit I will have to suffer the consequences of jail time. Actions have consequences and it is a common understanding that we become responsible for most outcomes deriving from the willful decisions and actions we make.

I often use the example of a father who becomes snowbound with his newborn daughter in their remote cabin in the woods. They are stuck and because of how remote it is help can not come for months. There is enough formula/food to feed himself and his child.   
No one in their right mind would suggest that this father has a right to kill his child or leave his child to die. In fact he is legally bound (duty of care) and morally bound to care for his child. 

If this father had a right to do whatever he wanted with his body then it would follow that he should have a right to at least leave his child to die and we all know intuitively that is wrong.

Some claim caring for a newborn is much less burdensome then pregnancy/childbirth.  

Two things in response to this. First, I have experienced both and imo the former (caring for a newborn) is much more strenuous and burdensome. Second, if they use this argument they are essentially admitting that bodily autonomy is not absolute. There is a spectrum on which rights and responsibilities must be weighed. The conversation then becomes more about where the boundaries are instead of the whole my body, my choice rhetoric. I mean, we all know that it is the body of the preborn child being killed right.

The conversation usually moves from the whole bodily autonomy rhetoric at this point to what they really feel which is that a preborn human person in their eyes is not really a worthy entity.

And that becomes another question altogether.  ",3,1500320415,2017-07-17 15:40:15

455,"I think that anyone who wants contraception should be able to get it either free or at an affordable price, especially in most areas of Africa where maternal mortality is high. However, the problem is that advocacy groups want to push African women who *don't* want to use contraception into using it. For instance, the majority of women who are classified by these groups as having an ""unmet need"" don't actually lack access to contraception (which is why that phrase is pretty deceptive). Many of the married women in developing countries who have a so-called unmet need aren't even currently sexually active (many of them have husbands that work overseas). About a quarter are concerned about side effects and another 16% are personally opposed to using it. According to Guttmacher only 5% of the married women with ""unmet need"" actually lack access to contraception. Telling women in developing countries that they ""need"" something they are opposed to just seems paternalistic to me. Like imagine the reactions if Jews and/or Muslims were told that they have an ""unmet need"" for pork. Again I don't have a problem with contraception in itself but I do have a problem with trying to coerce it onto women that don't want it, rather than giving them information they might actually want (like natural methods to control fertility).

456,"&gt;They claimed they should be allowed to choose how it is removed from them. It coming out alive is their choice. Even if it's viable.

Honestly though I think this is really the only consistent way to use the bodily autonomy argument. I don't think viability really matters; even at that stage it's still living off the mother, and a doctor isn't going to remove it at say, 25 weeks without a medical reason because of the risk to the fetus. If the fetus doesn't have the right to use the mother's body without her consent, and she can do with the pregnancy whatever she sees fit (giving birth, c-section, or abortion) then that applies through all nine months. 

As much as I disagree with abortion on demand throughout pregnancy, it just seems so inconsistent for pro-choicers to shout from the rooftops about bodily autonomy and reproductive rights of the woman at 20 weeks but then be totally fine with those rights being taken away a mere 4 weeks later.

Violating bodily autonomy, in the way that the fetus does, causes inconvenience for 9 months. They're not morally comparable harms.

If it was true that nobody had any right to your body and its labor, then infanticide by neglect would be be justified. Mothers have to use their bodies to feed and care for their infants. Even if a mother decided she didn't want the baby, putting the baby up for adoption requires her to use her body to tell somebody or drop the baby off somewhere. If other people truly have no rights over a woman's body, then an unwilling mother wouldn't be obligated to any of this, and could justifiably leave her baby in the crib to die of neglect. However, this is morally abhorrent. Infants do, in fact, have special claims on the bodies of their mothers.

The burglar analogy is bad because burglars intentionally violate the rights of others. A better analogy is JJ Thompson's people seeds argument, where you leave your window open and little seeds that sprout into people fly in and take root in your carpet. Thompson makes the case that, since it's your carpet, you can kill the people who sprout up. However, since the only justificatory factor is that you own the carpet, then it would also be morally permissible to purposely plant people seeds and kill them just for kicks. Since this seems morally abhorrent, this line of argument doesn't seem to really capture the grounds on which you can legitimately kill someone.

1,"I liked the article. I especially liked the part that stressed the importance of consistency. They're right; not opposing abortion in th e case of rape and incest is an inconsistent application of pro-life arguments. To be fair, I don't think most pro-life advocates actually agree with that position, but would be willing to accept it for now as an intermediate step. If that's the case, we need to unapologetically own up to our position if the question comes up, and have compelling arguments ready for why.

I am also a fan of not demonizing the opposition. We are better served by actually listening to and understanding pro-choice people, not only to the reasons why they're pro-choice but also to what they think of pro-life arguments and advocates.

Um, no it's not. In fact, more abortion restrictions lead to fewer abortions and the benefit of higher maternal health rates. See [here](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-11/mi-tca110614.php), [here](https://www.liveaction.org/news/think-abortion-restrictions-increase-maternal-mortality-think-again/) and [here](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/study-pro-life-states-give-life-more-abort-less).

In light of this supporting abortion on demand and without apology is not only dangerous to preborn children but mothers as well.

However, even if what you were saying were true (and as noted above it is not) a prolifer still could not accept abortion on demand because our whole philosophy rests on the notion that killing innocent human beings can not be used as a solution to problems. There are more humane ways to deal with crisis pregnancies.

For example if parents who were in impoverish situations were allowed to kill their born children at will this may reduce violent crime and save many lives but no sane person would ever condone this type of law or use this line of reasoning as an excuse to condone such a law.

Yet you think this is good logic? Come on, at least think about what you are saying before you let your words run rampant.

I understand your beliefs on abortion. So let's have a legitimate discussion, no straw men. There are a few things I think we could both agree on, and that most if not all pro-life advocates should agree on.

Teens will have sex. Premarital sex. The sexual revolution occurred in the 1920's, accelerated throughout the 1960's, and has shown no signs of slowing, abstinence-only be damned. With this, there is only so much that can be done to stem abortions.

1. Outlaw all abortion except in the cases of rape, incest, or when the abortion dangers the life (life, not health) of the mother. These reasons, commonly stated as reasons abortion must be legal, account for only .151% of all abortions.

http://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/

2. Cut federal funding from abortion clinics, and use this funding, along with additional government spending (including increased taxes if necessary) to create comprehensive federal sex education guidelines for state governments as well as to fund improvements in foster care and orphanage programs. I know the controversy with sex education, as many believe it will cause their children to have sex at an earlier age, or encourage premarital sex. However, this is unsupported by studies. What is supported is that comprehensive sex education reduces teen pregnancy and STD's. And even if sex Ed was guaranteed to increase rates of premarital sex (for fellow christians who are against it), which is worse, teens have more but much safer premarital sex, or those same teens ending the lives of innocent children from increased pregnancy? And for those opposed to big government and increased taxes, surely it is a price we can all pay to save the lives of the children that die in nearly 20% of US pregnancies. 

http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487

3. Allow women easy access to safe and cheap contraceptives, using government funds if necessary. This is the far superior option to government funded abortions. Contraceptives are not perfect, I understand that. As you said, there is the slim but real chance that someone having as safe sex as possible can still become pregnant. However, in these cases, the woman should still bring the child to bear, as they can then put the child up for adoption, without having to end that child's life. No ruined life, no tanked career. A well funded and well maintained foster care system will circumvent the argument of abortion out of inconvenience. True, a child in a foster home may not have a perfect life, but it is not our job to decide they don't have a right to life at all.

Why don't we just execute everyone like China, Iran or Pakistan? They have strong justice systems and have a great record when it comes to human rights.

&gt;Sure just gloss over the fact that you have have a good legal system without paying parasites 250 dollars an hour.

&gt;My point was that evidence exists on both sides, but one sides evidence isn't emotionalistic bullshit and that it would take some time, effort and honesty to figure out which is which.

Presumably the side that is complaining about lawyers being parasites and that we need to kill all the criminals is the one being emotional? 

&gt;But yet they do get out and kill again.

Mate, if they're getting let out and killing again, they probably wouldn't have been executed anyway. Its a choice between life in prison and execution, they don't let people who have committed crimes worthy of putting them on death row out after 10 years.

If you're that scared about your future being ruined, stop having sex. If you can't do that then that's the risk you choose to take.

33,"&gt; So youre saying that the hormonal abortion is more acceptible because of how it doesnt burn the embryo (as an ex), it merely makes the body detatch and birth the embryo?

Well let me clarify a bit more what my point was.

First and foremost my point was to take the *organ donation* situation and place it onto the Violinist situation (not abortion), to see how people felt about that.

Then secondarily, we could (possibly) translate that into an abortion situation. But this isn't necessarily the primary intention and some people may not agree with the analogy to abortion.

While I think we could delve into this argument (I see a point but don't think it applies universally), this is a separate argument from the ""killing vs letting die"" argument being made earlier. If abortion is wrong because parents have an obligation, then say that; using an argument about killing vs. letting die clearly isn't the clincher if when pressed, the argument shifts.

I subscribe politically to a pretty unpopular field of thought, so im used to hearing people with arguments they obviously are only regurgitating from other biased sources - for that reason I apologize because again I'm sure you've heard it all before.

I think it's wonderful when people such as yourself can take unplanned pregnancies and make the most of them, but it's so terrifying when people can't. I think of the horror stories I hear about foster care, the cost of having a child, and abuse that can happen to an unwanted child. Anecdotally, I know that my father tried to force my mother to have an abortion when she was pregnant with me and she obviously didn't. She dropped out of college and is now almost 40, raising a 5 year old on less than $10 an hour. If I hadn't been born, she would have gotten her degree and had a shot at a real job. Maybe some people can balance school and pregnancy, but many people can't and I just don't believe that it's fair to risk ruining your life over something preventable.

I also think of myself. People will say, ""if you're not ready for a baby, just don't have sex"" but I think that that's an extremity unrealistic viewpoint. Procreation is one of our strongest biological urges and instead of telling people not to do something they will inevitably do we need to be educating them more thoroughly, but reform to sex ed is a whole extra issue.

Anyway, I feel strongly towards this issue as a young woman with big plans for the future. I always practice safe sex, I've bought plan B if I thought there was even a .1% chance that something went wrong. Still, about a month ago I had a pregnancy scare and it sent my head in a tailspin. I think about people like me and I don't think it's fair to punish someone who does everything right to prevent pregnancy and still ends up in the small minority of people who end up pregnant anyway. Having a child right now would ruin my life, and when I practice the safest sex possible I simply don't consider that to be fair.

This may seem arbitrary, but I'm curious about pro-life perspectives on eating meat/animal products. Do you think it's hypocritical to care about the suffering of a human fetus but still consume meat and dairy, which by and large is a product of cruelty? Animals in factory farms are electrocuted, stepped on, have their babies taken from them and killed, are cut and left to bleed out etc etc which is treating life much more carelessly (or at the very least equally) than an abortion does but is almost entirely socially acceptable.

But why is it that people automatically get defensive when someone suggests that we should be teaching kids that they need to accept pregnancy as a biological side-effect of sexual intercourse, and that your willingness to accept this risk should be weighed when deciding to have sex. It's called being a responsible human being. It's also the reason that people need to stop being squeamish about condoms, and having them available to young people.

Sorry for the rant but I think it's really ignorant to suggest that abstinence  education, when done properly, increases pregnancies. It absolutely doesn't.

Well maybe you're not one of the pro-lifers that subscribes to this view. If so, then the OP isn't directed at you :)

&gt;Isnt it proper to say that in every abortion there is a killing, but there could be situations in which this is okay, basically?

Honestly, that's how I think of it. I don't get the distinction between killing a letting die. Even in the scenario I posed above, to me it *doesn't matter* what you call it -- you could say Beth would be killing Randy by unplugging. It doesn't matter because whatever you call it, it could still be morally acceptable or unacceptable. Trying to label things as acceptable/unacceptable by whether they ""kill vs let die"" to me seems like a distinction without a morally important difference.

&gt;But what if it a matter of a couple of weeks? Or maybe only a day?

In my analogy I am going with 9 months to make it more analogous to a pregnancy. You're absolutely right that there's probably some line we could draw when it comes to burden vs. benefit. However the reason I brought it up was to see how much one view will translate into another analogous scenario, or whether people are just making a special exception for pregnancy without articulating why.

57,"&gt; Can you explain this hormonal abortion a bit? You write that your scenario is an analogy to this type of abortion. From your writing it just seems to me like any other kind of abortion.

I'm going to make this as just one comment since it's kind of long. Regarding mifepristone (from wiki):

&gt;In women, mifepristone at doses greater or equal to 1 mg/kg antagonizes the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone.....  medical abortion regimens, mifepristone blockade of progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, and an increase in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins.

Normally progesterone stabilizes the thickened endometrial lining so that it'll be ready to accept an embryo. Antagonizing progesterone stops that. It degrades the thickness of the lining. It induces minor contractions and opens up the cervix. These are all the things that occur in a natural birth, but we call it ""induced"" if it doesn't occur spontaneously. 

So effectively mifepristone causes detachment of the embryo which is then ""birthed"" through the cervix/vagina. Since the embryo is too young to survive without a blood supply, it dies. 

Does that help? 

This is unlike some other abortions where they have to literally dismember a fetus (it's too big to just flush out through an induction). Or in some cases (not sure if they still do this) they would use saline, which chemically burns and kills the fetus. There are other methods but you get the point.

Most of the world has banned it actually. It's virtually non existent outside of Asia and Africa, two regions America shouldn't be competing with.

&gt;Common sense tells you a lethal injection is cheaper than a lifetime of food and shelter. The reason it costs much in the US is because of the separate problem of the extortionate parasite class known as lawyers combined with many states having ridiculous appeals processes pushed into law at the behest of an anti death penalty lobby. So it's not cheaper at all, unless you let a class of parasites profit from it on the taxpayers dime.

Yep, having a strong legal system that makes sure people are actually guilty is a bad thing. Makes sense. 

&gt;Wrong again. There are plenty of studies on both sides of course, cause ""science"" is like justice these days in which it goes to the highest bidder. But here's [one](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-penalty-deters-murders-studies-say/) I just grabbed from google. If you read and research enough the claims of both sides, instead of sticking with the propaganda that suits your narrative, you can find the truth on a lot of issues.
 
You can't discredit all science with one sentence and then use it as a source in the next. 

&gt;Maybe it has a little something to do with it, in the sense that it shows where we're at morally that we have more people angered by the execution of murderers than by the murder of unborn children. A nation of armchair eugenicists philosophizing about who deserves a chance at life.  

Life spent in prison isn't much of a life. Its not like they want these people let out. They just dont think the death penalty is justice. If it isn't thought to be murder, can it really be compared in their frame of mind? 

&gt;I've have had the honor of knowing several people with down syndrome and was good friends with one in particular and most of them were no more a burden than a rambunctious child, the ones with special medical needs were less burder then a child with diabetes (maybe we should test for and kill those too?). Sure some have bigger issues, but most of them were the joy of their parents lives and spread love of happiness to everyone they met. The idea that somehow they should have been killed is unfathomably evil.
You're believing and spreading lies and disinformation in support of evil.

Unfortunatley, I think a big shift in culture would have to happen and it's going to be difficult. Adoption might have to become almost as commonplace and expected as having biological children.

70,"&gt; You didn't say why most adoptions aren't of newborns.

Google: the majority of American adoptions actually involve children adopted out of foster care. About 135,000 children are adopted in the United States each year. Of non-stepparent adoptions, about 59 percent are from the child welfare (or foster) system, 26 (35100) percent are from other countries, and 15 (20250) percent are voluntarily relinquished American babies. http://www.pbs.org/pov/offandrunning/fact-sheet/

&gt;
You didn't take into account that 600,000 thousand unaborted babies will not be put up for adoption or placed in foster care. Many of them will go on to be well cared for by one or both of their own parents or other family members. 

Sure, some won't be conceived at all, but a large chunk of them are going to be put up for adoption. Even if we say 1/6, that's still 100,000 every year. 1/12 is 50,000 a year. Right now America is adopting 50,000 newborns and children from other countries. Its doubling or tripling the supply within a year. Even if waiting times are quite long right now, that's not sustainable. 

&gt;http://www.adopt.org/faqs

This says the wait time is between 2-7 years. Doubling the supply halfs the wait time so that quickly looks like 1-4.",1,1495892374,2017-05-27 09:39:34

Isnt it proper to say that in every abortion there is a killing, but there could be situations in which this is okay, basically? And you could argue the same with any killing?

As far as your scenario goes, im not really comfortable giving a definitive answer in regards to the killing vs letting die thing. It depends? If beth needs to be hooked up to randy her whole life, i dont think anyone can blame her for unplugging herself. She is not responsible for randys condition, and this applies no matter what length of time they need to be hooked up together. But what if it a matter of a couple of weeks? Or maybe only a day? If you stretch this scenario, i think we can see that her decision to unplug herself is more or less objectionable depending on the situation. Lets stretch it to the point of which she only needs to stay hooked up to randy for say 1 minute, after that she can go and randy is ok. But she still unplugs herself. Is it objectionable? In my opinion very much so, even if she isnt responsible for the position randy is in.

75,"&gt;  So I'm not exactly sure that our foster care system will be any more overrun with children if abortion become illegal.

150,000 adopts take place in the US annually, most of which aren't newborns. There's something like 600,000 abortions annually. 

The rest of what you said is pretty on point. If you banned abortion tomorrow, you'd end up with *a lot* of shitty parents and troubled kids.",2,1495886984,2017-05-27 08:09:44
76,"As much as I was turned off by your initial response to me (because it seemed to imply that abortion would be better, and because it had some aspects that I'm pretty sure will not happen here), I do agree that we should do more to make the adoption process easier, and becoming a foster parent much harder. But honestly, I thought the newborn adoption rate was like 100% and the number of parents wanting newborns far surpassed the amount available for adoption. I myself haven't looked at the statistics but I've seen stories of parents trying for years and being denied every time until they finally decided to adopt overseas. So I'm not exactly sure that our foster care system will be any more overrun with children if abortion become illegal. 

The only thing I can see causing this is mothers initially trying to raise a child they do not want, and not deciding to put them up for adoption until they are older. Then they might end up in foster care. But one of my relatives was a foster mom and the babies we would get were adopted from us shortly, unless they were going back home. The older children were always going back at first, until it was established that their parents sucked and then they would start the adoption process. But they were so messed up by then, that they would sabotage every adoption. And I hate to say it but those families are lucky. They had so many issues from home and from other foster homes they've been to. So babies don't stay long if they even show up in the first place, and every older kid (that my relative had at least) is not up for adoption or is presented with family after family and sabotages it.

I guess my point is that when abortion is made illegal, the problem we need to solve is the same as the one we need to solve now. Many parents with children in foster care, want their kids back, they just aren't good parents. They damage their children so it becomes infinitely more difficult to get them adopted later. Maybe we need to focus on taking these kids away sooner, but people (possibly including that child) wouldn't like that.",6,1495884833,2017-05-27 07:33:53

In point no 3 I seriously cant compare this Beth-Randy relationship as a pregnancy. 

Imagine this wasnt a 9 month situation, imagine this was just a two minutes situation. Jim took her kidney out, and gave it to Randy who is in coma. Jim is the one who commited the crime. Randy just receives the kidney. The punishment should be directed towards Jim? Or towards Randy? Should we take Beth's kidney out of Randy?
 There is a difference in NOT donating something to someone else, and taking away what it was given. Also, who receives the punishment?

In this example, Randy is more of a parasite to Beth, than a ""baby"". her body is not ""receiving"" him. 

This whole Jim/beth/randy situation looks more like a alien/ripley/belly-parasite-alien situation to me. 


There is also a whole different situation between not leting Randy who is sick already follow his natural evolution of his sickness. And cutting the natural evolution of a fetus that is healthy by living inside of the womb of the mother. 

You are not forced to do something good for someone else, it would be the ideal ofcourse! To help anyone you can.... but you should be forced to not harm someone else! 

Beth, by not helping Randy is not harming him, she is not helping him. Instead... in pregnancy, you need to harm someone else's natural evolution to end it's life. 


Yes, unplugging Randy would be leting die... as I said before in point 3, beth should have into consideration Randy's well being. But she is not forced to do good. And by not helping him, she is not doing harm, she is simply not doing good. There is a moral debate in that... but no one can force her to do good to him. 

Instead, in a pregnancy, you need to harm the other to end the pregnancy. Is not about ""helping"", the mother isnt helping the fetus, is a natural process... she need to do harm to end the pregnancy. And again... is understandable that you should not be forced to help someone else, but you should be forced to do not harm..

94,"&gt; On that note, I also don't think that from a medical point of view a human fetus dies because they can't breathe or whatever prochoicers try to make it out to be. They are dying because whomever takes the abortion pill is knowingly and purposefully forcing that child into circumstances (that take place in utero) which are not conducive to their survival. It's more like throwing your kid out in the cold.

Or...disconnecting someone from a vital protein source that keeps them alive? Like Randy?

See I'm just not really seeing the distinction you're making. It seems like ""a distinction without a difference."" You say that this child needs x and will die without it, therefore denying them or stopping x is killing them. But this seems to apply to Randy just as well.

&gt;I think in part because the child does not have an underlying medical condition while Randy does.

Assuming this is true (that we aren't labeling underdevelopment as a medical condition), *why* is that an important moral difference? This is something I have never really understood. Like are women only bound to provide the needs of a fetus that they didn't choose to connect to (rape pregnancy) because that fetus is in a ""non-medical condition"" state? I don't get why that obligates her any more than Beth should be obligated to keep helping Randy. If some third party can just come up and attach you to someone else, why is it ok to tell them ""you can't disconnect"" only if it's a fetus, but not Randy? I know you said it's because Randy has a medical condition -- I just don't get why that matters as far as obligation to save a life. 

It seems like when we talk about kids and ordinary needs, this always refers to cases where the parent has already consented to raising and taking care of that kid (be it consensual sex, adoption, whatever). But what obligates a rape victim to help with ordinary needs any more than Beth has to help with let's say a very, very common or even universal-at-age-65 condition that I'm making up for this analogy called ""rareproteinemia""? So even if we apply this ""ordinary need"" thing to Randy, would that obligate a random person like Beth to keep donating her blood to him?

97,"&gt;In other words, I dont think comparing Beth to a pregnant woman is a correct situation. Unless is a rape situation, 

Yeah it would effectively be a rape pregnancy. 

&gt;But let's say that there is an hypothetical world where people can be plugged in donating blood for 9 months without health/death consequences.

There are health and other consequences. Just not death. Beth doesn't want Randy to die, but she simply doesn't want to donate anymore. She has other things to do. Also it's making her anemic. Etc.

&gt;It was Randy who made Beth to be plugged in: she has no fault in his situation, and is only her decision to stay or leave. A baby never created himself on his own, so this situation does not applies to pregnancy).

This describes a rape pregnancy though. This does apply. 

In any case, I brought all this up to question how people apply this ""killing vs letting die"" perspective to other situations. *IF* you believe not donating organs is acceptable because it's ""letting die,"" then do you think unplugging here would be ""letting die"" too?

Did you carry out that intent? Or was this an unfortunate accident?

103,"&gt; How are you making that distinction? Does the child not die of their own underdeveloped state? 

I see it more like this, if I don't feed my child and they starve to death no one would ever say that they died because they were too underdeveloped to pick up a bottle and feed him/herself. On that note, I also don't think that from a medical point of view a human fetus dies because they can't breathe or whatever prochoicers try to make it out to be. They are dying because whomever takes the abortion pill is knowingly and purposefully forcing that child into circumstances (that take place in utero) which are not conducive to their survival. It's more like throwing your kid out in the cold. Or withholding food and shelter. If we look at these more analogous situations that can take place to a born children we call that murder or child neglect and the parent will be criminally charged.  

&gt;Does Randy not die from being disconnected from Beth? 

I thought he had an underlying disease that made him need to be connected to her. I may have misunderstood? In that case though I think he would die from his disease.
 
&gt;Why is the mother of a hormonal abortion the cause of death while Beth wouldn't be if she disconnected?

I think in part because the child does not have an underlying medical condition while Randy does. And the other part is because a parent is bound to provide for their child's ordinary needs. This pretty much means whatever is the normal or regular things that the child needs at whatever age they are at and in whatever society. Every preborn child needs to be connected to their mother so this falls under ordinary need. A parent is not responsible for providing for their child's extraordinary needs (like a Ferrari or a blood transfusion). To my understanding extraordinary means things that are not regular or normal for a kid to need. Something that is unusual for their age and place. So if a child gets a disease and needs a kidney you do not have to provide it. Same as if a preborn child is diagnosed with a heart condition that prenatal surgery can help with, a mother does not have to go for it.

2. It matters. If it didnt matter, then Beth would have the obligation to do something that her body isnt designed to do. 

3. What doesnt have to be natural? The atachment? I yet have not meet a unnatural atachment of the blastocyte.

I never said all feminists support abortion, I said they stereotypically do.

They're almost guaranteed to have a shorter lifespan than a ""normal"" person, and unfortunately have a much higher incidence of Alzheimer's.  **They are still worthwhile.**  The truth is most people aren't exceptional, and we know this intuitively.

Yes, a lot of people overcome the challenges of being born with downs. But a lot of parents also don't want their offspring to have any disadvantages in an already tough world. There are a lot of challenges to overcome even for people with relatively ""perfect"" genetics.

And I openly admit a lot of the reason why I would lean towards an abortion are selfishly motivated. A child with downs already means you will not raise a doctor. It means that while your friends' children are becoming valedictorian and going to Ivy League schools, it will be ""cute"" when your kid gets a job. Your kid will have ""overcome their disadvantages"" when they have some semblance of a normal life. It will be expensive, and for me, probably unfulfilling as a parent.

So yes, I openly support killing an unborn fetus if the parents (mother, really) decide to do so. Whether it is motivated by a genetic disorder, or not.

You are trying really hard to get out of this.

&gt;1. Beth didnt create the situation, she didnt make Randy sick, she didnt make him dependant/needed of only her.

Neither do rape victims.

&gt;2. Beth's body isnt designed to receive Randy. Beth's veins aren't going to a process of ""veins receptivity"" every month, so she can pick up either Randy, Jack or Sam, neither they will maintain such changes.

Does this matter? She's still completely capable of the action even if it isn't a natural design of her body.

&gt;Atachment of the embryo is a natural process. The same as the estrogens levels help the sperm going inside the cervical canal by making the mocus more soft, the progesterone in a woman's ovulation cycle, at the end, helps to stabilize the endometrium so is easier to the blastocite to atach to the uterine wall. To directly attack the endometrium, is done with the goal of hurting the blastocyte. 

It doesn't have to be natural though.

&gt;Now, avoding ovulation, example with a post day pill, is not killing. It is wrong from the moral's of the cathoic church, example in a willing and married couple. But it is not killing, because there is no baby to attach.

126,"&gt; The intent is not to no longer be pregnant, it's to eliminate an unwanted child, and we shouldn't allow people to pretend that this is not what it's about.

One thing I've seen brought up regarding this is the conditions of Romanian orphanages in the 70s, 80s and 90s. The government banned abortion and contraceptives encouraging population growth resulting in over 100,000 orphans under state care (more than 0.5% of the total population or 1,607,000 orphans in the US) living in appalling conditions. Reading even brief descriptions is horrific, it sounds like a concentration camp.

&gt;The children were often tied to their own beds or dangerously restrained in their own clothing. Physical and sexual abuse of children was reported to be common. Often, the children would spend their day naked because the staff had failed to put clothes on them, and the children would be sitting in their own urine. Nurses who worked at the institutions were not properly trained, and often abused the children. The children were also bathed in dirty bath water, thrown in three at a time by the workers. Due to the abuse children received from staff, older children learned to beat the younger children. All children, including girls, had their heads shaved, which made it difficult to differentiate the children. Many children had delayed cognitive development, and many did not know how to feed themselves. Physical needs were not met, as many children died for minor illness or injuries such as cataracts or anemia. Children also would starve to death. Physical injuries that had to do with development included fractures that had not healed right, resulting in deformed limbs. Some children were infected with HIV/AIDS due to unsterilised instruments.

128,"Ok, she will be plugged in with Randy to a machine, and Jim created this situation.

I wouldnt compare Beth's situation to a mother and child situation, instead for me it seems more logical to compare it to a twin-twin transfusion syndrome situation. 

I which Jim is the ""parent"" who created the situation and Beth and Randy the twins, who Jim ""created"". Where Beth, is the donator/victim twin. 

In other words, I dont think comparing Beth to a pregnant woman is a correct situation. Unless is a rape situation, Beth current condition wasnt created on her own. 

But let's say that there is an hypothetical world where people can be plugged in donating blood for 9 months without health/death consequences. And the reason why Beth wants out is simply because she does not want to.

For me, there is a moral situation in game. 

I think, and this is my personal perspective, you should not give a person a bigger punishment for what they did wrong to you. 

So, if someone kidnapped you, there is no excuse to give the death penalty to that person.

If someone robed you, there is no reason to kill the sibling of that person.

The punishment should not never be heavier than the crime commited.

So, I will take the liberty and change your hypothetical situation.

1. It was Beth the one who decided make Randy sick with this exclusive disease (dependant exclusively of her) and now, without any health consequences, she regrets doing so: she has a moral obligation to keep until the 9 months are over, since she was the one who put him in that situation. 

2. It was Randy who made Beth to be plugged in: she has no fault in his situation, and is only her decision to stay or leave. A baby never created himself on his own, so this situation does not applies to pregnancy).

3. Is Jim the one who forced both Randy and Beth to be connected. Is Jim's crime, and Beth should have the moral consideration, when making her decision, of taking Randy's wellbeing in good oponion when making the decision of plugging out. The same Randy, that so far in your example seems to be very passive, maybe he is passed out... but if he is not, he should have also the moral obligation to consider Beth's best well being. Also, The punishment should be directed towards Jim. But sadly, Beth is not oblied to be plugged in, there is a moral reasons to be, but not obligations.",2,1495774352,2017-05-26 00:52:32

A lot to respond to so sorry if this is long.

&gt;I think that you have to consider the relationship of the child to the parent. The child has additional positive rights (right to have their ordinary needs met) that others do not have.

I can kind of see that argument. But for me, the right of the child has to do with the responsibility of the parents who created that child, and/or who willingly took on that responsibility such that abandoning it at a later time is unacceptable (for example the parent of an adopted child). Merely being forced to physiologically reproduce (i.e. through rape, as you rightly pointed out) shouldn't endow a woman with responsibility any more than being physiologically forced to donate blood to Randy. 

In any case though this would be an entirely different argument against abortion than one about ""killing vs letting die.""

&gt;It still seems like Randy will die of his disease while a preborn child dies directly because of the abortion?

How are you making that distinction? Does the child not die of their own underdeveloped state? Does Randy not die from being disconnected from Beth? Why is the mother of a hormonal abortion the cause of death while Beth wouldn't be if she disconnected?

155,"I don't think that forcing organ donation is analogous to denying the legal availability of abortion.

We are legally bound to respect others right to life (that is the right to not be killed) through inaction but we are not legally bound to perform a willful action to save a life. 

There is a difference between positive rights (obliges actions) and negative rights (obliges inaction). 

Think about it this way, you can not steal the starving man's last piece of bread (negative right) but you do not have to give him anything from your loaf (even though he will starve to death without it).

Denying elective abortion is in keeping with already existing laws. Everyone has a right to life (the right to not be killed) but everyone does not have a right to be saved. Only certain subsets of people are legally protected under duty of care.

That being said, you mention the fact that the body is already dead so that is a factor to consider.

In the end though I am personally against forced organ donation. I think that the price that society would pay as a whole is to high. We would be sacrificing the right to freedom of religion and consciences. We would be opening up a pandora's box for human rights abuses within the medical community. It would set a precedence for the human body to be used as a commodity. I just personally think that it is a bad idea all together.

164,"Pro-life here, and I actually like the idea of organ-donor-by-default. Maybe with opt-out to avoid offending people who are strongly against it: I imagine that a by-default policy would provide enough organs that we could ethically spare a few.

One big difference I can think of, though, is that abortion is an active act, whereas failing to donate an organ is a passive act.

Generally speaking about bad acts, is passive less bad than active? Depends on who you ask. But if you did a survey, I'd expect some people to say they're the same, some people to say active is worse than passive... and very few people to say that active is better than passive (e.g., if you steal food from a homeless person, that's bad, but if you haven't donated to your local food bank, you are literally Hitler.

165,"The key difference between abortion and not being an organ donor (or donating blood, kidneys etc while still alive) is that the former involves killing someone, while the latter is simply not intervening to help someone. 

If you do nothing, the unborn child would otherwise live, but if you do nothing, the patient would otherwise continue being sick or die. Killing someone is worse than doing nothing for a chance to help. 

The law reflects this. With some exceptions (like caring for a dependent person) it is written with negative rather than positive obligations: it is illegal to kill someone but it isn't illegal to not stop someone from dying.

IDK, to me Republicans really don't seem to be as ""purist"" on abortion as Democrats. Candidates like Romney and Trump had to switch positions on it in order to run for president (but Democrats have to do the same) but I'm not seeing a serious conversation among Republicans over whether to kick out pro-choice members of the party. And there are quite a few of them in blue states. 

Also, I really don't think pro-choicers are in much of a position to criticize pro-lifers for not being more economically liberal at this point. When the ""liberal"" party isn't letting you in, you kind of have no choice but to be a Republican or join a small 3rd party, or nothing.

I do agree with the sentiment that people shouldn't get medals or something for NOT killing their kids, but think about how she must feel. Her school is against her, the baby's father is not around, and that's on top of that there's the struggle she's going to face being a single mother. But the people in this thread thinks she needs to be shamed and punished MORE? 

What are you hoping to achieve there? It's not like she can go back in time and undo it, all she can do is be the best mother she can (which she is planning to do, because she clearly loves her baby very much). But you're right, she had premarital sex, so she's a horrible person and deserves to be as miserable as possible because that will help her and her baby somehow? Again, what is the goal? 

And then I think, what if a young woman in a similar situation sees this reaction? If she has an abortion, she's a terrible person. If she doesn't have an abortion, she's still a terrible person and she and her baby can't ever forget that! But then again, think about that last quote in the article (if you read it), if she has the abortion, she's not going to get kicked out of school or shamed publicly... Hmm... (Of course that's not the solution I advocate for at all, but that's what this kind of shaming could push people to consider)

Everyone makes mistakes, even if it's one you know you wouldn't make. Nobody is happy to go through an unplanned pregnancy, but it's a new life coming into the world, that's a beautiful thing. And if the mother is ready to try her best, and she and her baby are shown forgiveness, compassion, love and support (in a time when they probably need it the most), then they can make something unfortunate into the start of a wonderful life.

I thought this article is interesting because the most pro-choice people's always try to use these arguments to hide under these victims to justify their cause when majority of people abort unborn for financial and convenient reasons. I thought it would be important to separate these two.  Prolife are not trying to antagonize these women. Offering them help through counseling and financial support which prolife clinic is doing in my opinion opposite of antagonizing them.
Personally, in my opinion feel free to disagree, even in these circumstances unborn have right to live. Many people would disagree bc babies from these circumstances will remind them of tragic and unthinkable circumstances therefore some people claim that it is the best interest for mother to abort unborn babies. But I think that would not be good reason enough to abort them. I see logical fallacy in this. I do not think it is fault of unborn and mother that unborn have to be born this way. Babies might remind painful and tragic event but I do not think aborting bring emotional healing from the past. We have to wrestle with idea of how civil society would treat innocent being when they remind us of tragic event?
But anyway we have to reminded that these are exceptional cases (although serious).

Life
*noun*

1.
the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.

2.
the existence of an individual human being or animal.


The necessary features of all living creatures as taught in the modern biology curriculum:

Movement    ☑ 

Respiration   ☑ 

Sensitivity    ☑ 

Growth         ☑ 

Reproduction ☑
 
Excretion       ☑ 

Nutrition       ☑

Mate if you think abortions became legal and the number of them suddenly skyrocketed, you don't know anything about capitalism. Do you think there wasn't a black market for them? Do you think people were campaigning for them because they thought it would be a good thing to start doing? No. Clearly if Margaret Sanger can claim 1 million occur annually, there was plenty going on. 

&gt;Sure it is, and a whole lot more. In fact, if 'comprehensive sex ed' didn't come with a big slew of social/lunatic agendas attached to it, and no possibility of inserting them, the interest in it would die off altogether. 

Oh boy, an RT link, that's a good start. That article is ridiculous fear mongering. Actively sabotaging a result you would approve of. 

Please answer me this; Do you want teenagers to initiate sexual contact later and have a reduced chance of getting pregnant unless they intend to?

&gt;Further, 'people's beliefs and wishes' are A) often terrible, and B) typically run roughshod over, particularly in those classes.

Maybe that's because people like you actively fight against the classes or their children's inclusion in them. Or maybe that's just wrong, have you been in a sex ed class recently?

&gt;Margaret Sanger shooting from the hip with assertions and anecdotes does not a fact make. Abortions used to be infrequent.

Because she had no data to rely on; she had guesses, and so did her sources. And she had every reason to bluff.

That's not my point, I wasn't presenting those numbers as fact, they were being reported, as we don't have any data on the number of abortions that were occurring, we can't say anything as a fact.

1. No they weren't avoided before. Margaret Sanger believed the number of abortions occurring was around 1 million per year. 

2. Comprehensive Sex Ed isn't about 'pick out the best sex toy for their anuses' it's to teach people to respect people's beliefs and wishes, that sex doesn't need to be rushed into, it's not the only thing in the world. Its teaching people how to have sex safely when they're ready for it.

3.Writing off any study you don't like without even seeing the publisher to blatantly anti intellectual. Is the Journal of Adolescent health biased? 

&gt;Teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescentsexual activity or STD. Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.

Margaret Sanger wrote in **1918.**

&gt;[In the very nature of the case, it is impossible to get accurate figures upon the number of abortions performed annually in the United States. It is often said, however, that one in five pregnancies end in abortion. **One estimate is that 150,000 occur in the United States each year** and that **25,000 women die of the effects of such operations in every twelve months.** Dr. William J. Robinson asserts that there are 1,000,000 abortions every year in this country and adds that the estimate is conservative. He quotes Justice John Proctor Clark as saying that there are at least 100,000 in the same length of time in New York City alone.](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=232534.xml)

324,") 1. I grew up catholic, and also, in a very prolife family. 

Before people didnt have to say you were prolife, it was the ""obvious"" thinking that you were killing a child when aborting; Yet, many people and I say also catholics, when their girls loss virginity and got pregnant would feel shamed and send them to abort, my family never did that, it was not a shame and it was not the child fault, this is why I say that besides being raised catholic I was raised prolife. 

) 2. Each case is different, most ectopic pregnancies are an emergency, and therefor need a procedure to be extract the embryo, for obvious reasons the embryo or fetus will die, but is not the main goal of the operation, the main goal is to stop the bleeding that is killing the woman, sadly the cause is the location the embryo is, I dont even consider this an ""abortion"", since abortion main goal is to kill, the ectopic pregnancy surgery does not kill directly, is a consequence of the procedure. I would like to mention that there are at least 2 cases of ectopic pregnancies that survived and reached full term in my city. They did not develope inside the fallopian tube, instead completely outside of the uterus. Should I mention that the mothers who gave birth (trough c-section) to this babies, didnt have any sonogram... About cojointed twins, if possible, the best would be to save both, but if one dies in the process of separating them, is a natural consequence and not a direct killing. 

) 3. When the fetus exists the womb. 

) 4. Because most people have no way to know their conception days. Sperms can survive as long as 3-5 days inside the mucus of the woman. Even if you know when your parents had sex the year they conceived you, you still wouldnt know what they they conceived you, since it could be in the next five days. Birth is obvious, and for centuries people has used birth to start counting.

) 5. Inmaculate conception 8 December, we do celebrate it. 
    Anunciación a Maria,  25 March.
     Also, December 24/25 does not celebrate the birth of the Lord for catholics. It celebrates the day, the lord was introduced to the world. 

Let me explain this better, imagine you have a girlfriend/boyfriend, and you remember the day you met that person you love, for the first time. Some people even celebrate that day! Yes, your girlfriend was probably born more than 2 decades ago, and existed before that date, but for you, the day you meet him/her it was the day 0. 

Is the same way the birth of Jesus, catholics do not only celebrate the birth, we celebrate the presentation of the Lord to to the shepperds (us, the lay people) and the people who came to visit him. 

In fact, we celebrate that from 25 December until 6 January, when the magic kings arrive and complete the whole ""introduction to the world"" space time. 

We also celebrate the day when Isabel (Mary's cousin) and the kid in her womb (the one who baptized Jesus) Recognize Mary and Jesus as the lord when Jesus was still inside the womb, 31 May. 

This is an important date for prolife catholics since Isabel recognizes Jesus in the womb as the lord, even before he was born, and she does so thanks to her own joy and the joy of her son in the womb Jhon who ""jumps in joy"" after Mary arrives and speaks to Isabel. 

So, you see the active role of Jhon inside the womb and the words Isabel told Mary.... i wont bore you with catholic stuffs. As you can see we celebrate a whole bunch of stuffs.

This isn't even just about sin. You don't have to believe in God to realize that kids screwing out of wedlock and getting girls pregnant a bad idea. (Apparently, though, it helps. Or it did, once.)

But really. Pragmatic? Incentives? I know how you're thinking, but I'm telling you: it's a mistake. This isn't some consequentialist game where the ends justify the means and we're all at the mercy of women who are effectively saying 'Never do anything that makes me (or any other woman) feel like I did something wrong, or the kid gets it!'

Should we try to be nice about it, and praise people who don't have sex before marriage, or at least girls who don't get pregnant? Wait, but if we do that, we're back to shaming the girls who do get pregnant again, and it's back to incentivizing abortion. That's poison. We're getting tied in knots and dodging common sense (and for Christians, moral teaching) because we're afraid people are going to kill their kids if they feel ashamed.

It'd be one thing if I was saying crush these women's spirits - I do not advocate anything like that.

She got pregnant outside of marriage. Congratulations to her for not succumbing to the desire to kill the child, but she is no more a hero than her father is for failing to beat the living daylights out of her when he received the news.

There are no competing values here. You can be pro-life, and also regard out of wedlock pregnancy (dare I say it, even sex) as something condemnable, especially in a Christian community.

So frankly, good for Heritage.

336,"First, thanks for the respectful dialogue. There are a lot of really great answers, so I'm just adding on anything I think might be missing rather than fully answering. 

1) I was raised in a pro-choice household, but pretty quickly (middle school or so?) I came to realize (1) that fetuses are humans (they are organisms in the scientific sense and are classified as homo sapiens like other homo sapiens) and (2) that all humans have the same rights. Liberalism is in my blood: I can't just say ""Almost all humans have basic rights."" 

2) In a word, yes. For further reading, I recommend Pope John Paul the Second. (Whether or not you're religious, you can't deny he was pretty influential on the movement.) Basically, in many cases, the best course of action is to separate the patients. We don't yet have the technology to save someone in an early stage of development who has been separated from the mother, but in such cases the fetus/embryo has died of his or her own pathology. It's not analogous to deliberately killing a healthy pre-born human just because he or she is unwanted. 

3) Birth is just another significant milestone in development, like the beginning of heartbeat or puberty.

4) It's culturally significant because it's the first time that the rest of the culture sees a person's face, but it doesn't have a lot of philosophical significance. 

5) I don't have a lot to add here. We celebrate Christmas because celebrating births are a pre-existing cultural reality, and Catholics celebrate the Annunciation. ",2,1495327648,2017-05-20 20:47:28

I am non-religious, and that is the description/ label i am most comfortable with. I came to my current viewpoints mostly from my own thinking. I used to be prochoice but changed viewpoint over time. The way i changed from prochoice to prolife was basically just from thinking about life &amp; death in general. If no afterlife existed, i was thinking about how it would *feel* to be dead, or how it *feels* not to feel anything at all (which is a weird &amp; very difficult thing to try to imagine, since you are dead you cant feel anything, you cant *feel* to begin with, so it's a bit paradoxical. I guess... I dono...) Either way, the conclusion i eventually took was essentially that we should try to maximize our lives here on earth (or in space, or wherever you might be) &amp; live our lives the best way we can, since NO MATTER what belief about afterlife you have, we can all agree that we have ATLEAST one life here on earth as human beings. So we should take care of our lives. Then slowly, the thought started to creep in me that getting the chance to live is a pretty priceless gift. Getting the chance to live &amp; experiencing life? We are all going to die eventually, and obviously we were dead before we were alive (duh), we only have one chance at life here as human beings. So how horrible is it that some people are just deprived of this? Which is essentially what abortion does, it deprives a concieved human being from experiencing life. All killing does actually. Sometimes killing can be justfied, yes, but if we are to agree that life has some sort of inherent value (which pretty much everyone thinks in one way or another anyway, since they value their own life) we should also agree that in general, killing is wrong.

I guess some people want to argue that a fetus isnt human and thus abortion isnt killing of a human, although it is obviously a killing of ""something"" in that case. (Which IMO is a viewpoint futile to argue for). The best way i see someone arguing in favour of abortion is admitting that it is indeed killing of a human, but that it is one way or another ""justified"".

2. When you compare what NASA believes to be a ""Life in Space"" &amp; compare it to few cells developing inside a woman - there's not much difference. Life is Life! So impregnated cell in a woman womb is a Life for me.

3. Just a date, from which someones calculates years.

4. Very easily - even in 21st century, many females &amp; especially males can't know when the baby was conceived. So we took an old habit, one which we had for several thousand years: using birth date as our birthday!

5. Even in the Bible &amp; in our religion we know when the Holy Mary got pregnant (check Luke 1,26-1,38: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A26-38 ). &amp; yes, it's celebrated in Eucharist.

372,"1. That's a big ask but I guess the major difference I have with the way (post)modern thought looks at ethics is that I think the rule should serve the normal case. Always exceptions exist and we should be compassionate, flexible and understanding in the case of abnormal cases. But the rule should serve the ordinary not the exceptional case.   So when I think about the ordinary case, how should a mother feel about her child, I feel she should love and want to protect that child. She should not make those feelings contingent on the child being ""chosen"" by her or ""planned"" or her having a good idea how she is going to pay for it. She should be loving and protective even if she is poor and the child is an accident. So when a mother will fully destroys her child that goes completely against the instincts a mother ought to have. In a literal sense it's vicious.   So society at large says ""but what about the sick woman who might die if she has a child? What about the deeply traumatised woman who cannot mentally cope?"" And it makes the rule for those exceptions and then allows a huge number of the merely vicious to act on their vices by it. (I don't mind you think the exception we should make for these cases is allowing them to kill their children either though!)

2. I don’t know enough about parasitic twins to really answer that question, but in the case of the ectopic pregnancy I think the clear best answer is to *try* and surgically remove the baby from the wrong place and *try* to place it into the womb. Now its true that right now we can’t do that successfully and in all likelihood it will just kill the baby. But figuring out how to do it successfully is well within the capacity of mankind, we just have to work it out, right now the impetus to work it out is greatly reduced by the “ease” of just killing the baby.

3. Birth is when you leave the womb and come into the outside world. People get to meet you and you start interacting with people besides your mother.

4. Because we can’t predict with enormous accuracy when people are conceived and we know exactly when people are born. Same for counting our age. In terms of development our gestational age is actually more predictive though.

5. Orthodox and Catholic Christians do celebrate the conception of Christ (and Mary) as well as Christ’s birth. The particular emphasis is more of a commercial thing because the feast of the Wise Men and of St. Nicholas are both around that time and those feasts involve the giving of presents which over time got absorbed into Christmas.",6,1495097160,2017-05-18 04:46:00
373,"1. My family didn't raise me with much of an opinion on abortion. The ""default"" choice in my region/culture is prochoice, so I believed that. When I learned how the life cycle, fertilization, and development happened when I was about 14, I realized that it totally conflicted with prochoice ideology. In biology class, we were taught how a new organism forms at conception and looked at beautiful pictures of embryos developing in the womb. Then an hour later in sex ed, the teacher discussed abortion, killing that same baby, as a ""valid choice"" that ""some religions think is a sin because it ends a potential life."" Frankly, it was at best disgusting and at worst enraging. 

2. Yes, a human that is growing in the wrong place, like a fallopian tube or another embryo, is a human being deserving life. It would be justifiable to let the child die as a result of treatment to save the mother, if the alternative is that both mother and child die. 

3. Not sure what you're asking, but yes, what everyone else said: leaving the uterus.

4. Because most people don't know their conception day and IMO that would be a gross question to ask your parents. Our lifespan does include the 9 months before. It is even easier to document it today with ultrasound photos and such. 

5. Immaculate conception refers to the conception of Mary not Jesus. And we do celebrate the day that Gabriel told Mary, it's called the [Annunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_in_Christian_art) and has been one of the most popular subjects in Christian art since ancient times. It is a very important day for Christians, but it isn't really a part of the ""cultural Christianity"" that is more familiar in popular culture. In the Apostles Creed we say Jesus was ""conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary"" which emphasizes both. Did you know that the first person to rejoice at the news of Christ's arrival [was a fetus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A39-45&amp;version=ESV)?

384,"1. My parents are strongly pro-life but in college I became pro-choice in the first trimester because I thought it was the more ""compassionate"" stance to take on abortion, plus I bought into the pro-choice argument that making abortion illegal does nothing to stop it. However around last year I started to really think about my position on abortion and realized it didn't make much intellectual sense. If abortion is to be allowed for bodily autonomy then it would have to be allowed all 9 months (I was very uncomfortable with late term abortion), and there was nothing special that happened after 10-12 weeks that suddenly makes the fetus any different than it was before, so the line was completely arbitrary. Then I realized that the argument that making abortion illegal doesn't reduce abortion rates is based on flawed data and is contradicted by better studies. 

2. An ectopic pregnancy is considered a human life, but pro-lifers allow abortion (or more literally removal of the embryo) in this case because it's either the embryo dies or both die, so better one death than two. Plus it could be considered self-defense.

3. It means what the word is? The point where the fetus comes out of the uterus.

4. Traditionally, many Asian cultures consider you to be one year when you are born (not sure if China does this anymore, but Korea still does), though I don't think they celebrate ""conception days"" because no one knows when that actually is.

5. Again, no one knows when Jesus' actual conception day was (and his actual birthday isn't known either). There's more detail in the Bible about his birthday than his conception day (the angels, shepherds, wise men etc, whereas his conception day is one angel talking to Mary) so it's a bigger holiday in Christianity.

397,"&gt;I can acknowledge the discrepancy in comparing a zygote to a single called sex organism like a sperm or egg

A human organism is the zygote. Gametes -- sperm and eggs -- are not human organisms. Neither are the singular cells that make up the organism (myocyte, epithelial cell, neuron, etc). 

1. I ""grew up pro-life"" but eventually took on this belief that abortion is wrong in my late teens when I started to learn more about biology, that an embryo is a human organism just at an earlier stage of life than you or me. I don't find bodily autonomy a compelling enough argument to kill a human being who was created resulting from consensual sex. 

2. All human organisms deserve a right to life. That means the mother, the embryo that is ectopic and parasitic. Problems arise when one right to life directly conflicts with another. It's about triaging and saving what lives you can. We have no way to save the life of an ectopic pregnancy, for example, and it *will* kill the mother. That's an acceptable reason for an abortion.

3. Birth is when a fetus exits the uterus, usually accompanied by spontaneous breathing and other physiological changes. It's one of many major steps in the life timeline (others include walking, talking, puberty, menopause, etc). 

4. Because people don't know when conception occurs. It's estimated. Birth is an easy way to standardize age, as it's quite obvious. Also people find conception-day gross because it's when their parents definitely had sex :P These cultural habits made out of convenience do not equate to scientific facts. I mean this is like if someone in 1915 asked ""if women are equal to men, why aren't they allowed to vote?""

Their anger can be traced to their poor career performance and druggie lifestyle. I believe most of them waste their life being angry at people more successful than themselves. They also try to bring others around them down to their level, much like crabs in a bucket.


I think shaming alt right trailer trash will teach other such trailer trash around them a lesson. This is why it is important to always speak up when some altright bigot tries to spread hatred.


It is important to note that such 'people' cannot be reasoned with logically.  Many of them have spent years being bigots and logic reasoning is a waste of time. It's much like playing chess with an angry pigeon. Best to just shame them and show to those around them their hypocrycy.

404,"&gt; More shame means less abortions. 

No.  More shame means further antagonization of the pro-life movement and pro-life ideology, which probably means *more* abortions.  I understand what you're saying.  If we could magically make every woman who got an abortion feel ashamed of her decision, we would probably see a significant drop in abortions.  I don't think this would be a good way to reduce abortions, but I guess it would work.

However, what you're advocating isn't even that.  Trying to ""shame"" someone doesn't guarantee that they will feel ashamed of their actions.  Calling these women ""horrible people"", ""degenerates"" or showing them ""zero sympathy"" will not automatically make them regret their decision.  If you could control all the input coming into a woman's life and make her truly feel that she was a horrible person for doing this, yeah you could probably make her stop doing it, (it would be an awful way to do it, but it would work) but you are just one voice she hears.  OP didn't post this on r/prolife, she posted it on r/twoxchromosomes.  She will be surrounded by voices telling her that her abortion was ok.  If the only voice telling her that what she did was *not* ok is calling her names, do you think she's going to listen to that voice?  (This isn't a logical response to someone telling you you're wrong, but it is human nature.)

I guess the bottom line is that if you want to change minds and hearts, you have to love people and meet them where they are.  Heck, that's even a good idea if you *don't* want to change their minds.  When you recognize that people are no better or worse than you are, and that you have no right to judge them, but only to love them, then they will grow to trust you and listen to you.",14,1495047500,2017-05-17 14:58:20

432,"An interesting read. I can't say I'm surprised at the Canadian populace's ignorance on their own government's policies. Many people in the U.S. are similarly uninformed. Unfortunately, the media works hard to keep abortion politics out of the public eye, and although that's not the sole reason, I believe it contributes to why public opinion is so slow to change.

&gt;Legal experts are just that: legal experts.

I would argue that sometimes they're not even that. The decision in *Roe v Wade* was a hodgepodge of terrible reasoning and legal floundering. Many of the recent court cases have also been grossly activist in nature, with little to no regard for law or precedent. Supreme court opinions would almost be comical if they didn’t usurp federalism at every turn.

&gt;No matter which way you look at it, the law does not fully represent the will of the people. This is a problem in any democracy, especially for something as contentious as abortion.

Not sure I agree with this, either. It’s only a problem if the will of the people is just. Democracy itself doesn’t safeguard individual rights. It’s simply mob rule. Just my two cents.

&gt;Further, the Canadian Medical Association puts additional limits on abortion. They ensure that abortions cannot occur if the potential fetus is viable, which they define as either being at 20-weeks gestation or weighing over 500g.

Good to know that the medical community in Canada is more ethical than the politicians who rendered abortion legal. But then the article goes on to show the distribution of abortions by gestational age, and these limits seem to fly out the window (587 abortions at 21+ weeks? Were none of these fetuses viable?). I feel like there is a lack of clarity here, or maybe there’s something I missed. Regardless, I highly doubt that private abortion clinics in Canada adhere to the standards and limits set by the CMA.

I found this article very informative. It of course goes without saying, but it’s a shame that such first-world countries like ours lag behind in the legality of abortion.

They have a dire track record and people are absolutely sick of everything that comes with the Catholic Church. .. pedophilia, rape, murder of children, enslavement and abuse of women and their interpretation of morality does not fit with the Irish people. Most people are atheist but must baptise their children in order to ensure a school place. How dare they? Utter indoctrination.

The church's ideas and views and things do not aline with what the citizens believe. Most people don't believe an abortion is murder. What they do believe is murder is the murder of newborn babiesm infants and young children, they also believe that the death of these groups as a result of physical abuse, neglect and starvation is morally wrong and evil. 

So just because you, a Catholic priest, believes that Mary was a virgin and that abortion is murder does not mean I have to believe it. Most people don't. 

Right this instant I'm watching a program called Vincent Brown which is questioning why the Catholic Church still has 91% of all schools in the country under their auspices.

So, as a priest, who gets your morals elsewhere than I do, not for lack of being beaten over the brow by your rhetoric by priests and nuns, tell women that they are murderers for stopping a process within their body.

450,"&gt;Supposing that (3) it is even true, you haven't established the antecedent of that conditional as it applies to moral rules, i.e., that moral rules do not exist in space and time. 

What did you mean by this? What did you mean by ""you haven't established the antecedent of that conditional as it applies to moral rules, i.e., that moral rules do not exist in space and time""? Please be more specific. 

&gt;Even if you did this, you haven't explained what an ""abstract value assigned to a certain x"" even means, 

Take for example, the statement ""Mary has the right to life."" What that statement means is that Mary has an abstract property assigned to her life, such that, any act from a human that takes away that life from Mary, has violated a moral rule. We could say that an abstract value is assigned to her life. If you were try to go further in trying to make me explain, I would probably have to say that I could not, since abstract values, and objects cannot be explained further, since they are fundamental. 

&gt;and supposing that it even has a meaning, you haven't established why a moral rule necessarily implies that abstract value. 

The truth of the statement ""You ought to not kill this man"" cannot be dependent upon physical objects, since the statement is not asserting anything that can be analyzed by using physical concepts. Therefore, whether, or not the statement is true, or not, seems to depend on non-physical objects (non-spatiotemporal, and causally inert). Thus, a moral rule necessarily implies an abstract value. If that analysis is incorrect, then we could just say that a moral rule necessarily implies an abstract value, because that is how moral rules are understood in ethics, or in other words, that the idea that a moral rule necessarily implies an abstract value is an axiom in ethics. 

&gt;Above all of this, you haven't established why moral rules are not man made, 

When I originally said that moral rules were not human made, I was referring to objectively existing moral propositions that are true. Moral rules cannot be man-made, for if they were, then the truth of moral rules would be determined by subjectivity, which would thus lead to contradictions. For example, if moral rules are man-made, then it would be possible for the statement ""All killing is wrong,"" to be true, and the negation of it to also be true, if it was merely decided to be so. It is possible for some moral rules to be human made. I can make one up right now: All infanticide is morally permissible. However, I cannot determine the truth of this moral rule by mere subjectivity. 

&gt;If the analogy concerns merely a killing, then you analogy is in the form of Sally's lethal gunshot is to killing as abortion is to killing. Now you said earlier in this discussion that ""murder is any killing that is immoral,"" and the title of your post is ""an argument for the moral permissibility of abortion through libertarian ethics."" You also said that ""The thing that is relevant [to my argument] is to what extent my possible world resembles the real world in morally relevant ways."" If murder isn't part of your argument's analogy, then what argument are you trying to make with your analogy

The argument I have made with my analogy is that since my scenario is analogous to the abortion scenario in morally relevant ways, then abortion is morally permissible. That is a simplified summary of my argument.  

&gt;Additionally, you asked ""Did Sally commit murder?"" Then you answered ""No."" A reasonable reading of those two sentences is that you asked a non-rhetorical question and then answered that question by applying a moral rule to Sally's behavior. 

I agree.

&gt;It's unclear just what ""whether it is murder, or not, depends some moral assumptions,"" is supposed to mean at this point, since it is clear that you have already applied a moral rule to Sally's act.

It means exactly what it means. I really don't see what the problem is here. 

&gt;Yes your analogy does contain those elements, and, as you mentioned earlier, ""killing."" But there's little substance to the argument that ""Sally's lethal gunshot is to killing as abortion is to killing.""

I never made that ""argument."" Arguments =/= claims. 

&gt;Isn't the point of your argument to persuade others of your moral opinion? If the analogy of your argument excludes the murder question, then what's the point of your analogy?

To show that scenario A, and B have moral similarities, and consequently, that abortion is morally permissible. 

&gt;Unlike Sally, the causative connection in your argument is diluted and attenuated by the fact that billions of other people are contributing to global warming. 

True, but I don't see how that is morally relevant. How is the number of people committing an act that will ultimately have negative consequences morally relevant? 

&gt;If, however, you were the only producer on earth of global warming gases, and you intentionally drove your car with full knowledge that there would otherwise be no lethal epidemic heat wave but for the fact that you drove your car, then your intent to kill those people could be inferred.

If your argument is that it could be legitimately concluded that I had the intent to kill those people based the fact that I intentionally drove my car with full knowledge that there would otherwise be no lethal epidemic heat wave but for the fact that I drove my car, then I will have to say that the logic of your inductive argument is weak. It is weak, for it possible, and reasonable, to believe that I merely intended to drive my car to get to work. 

&gt;Well if the intruder is analogous to the unborn human to be aborted, either they both have private property rights, or neither has private property rights. Which one is it? 

I think you presented a false dichotomy there. I think that the intruder has private property rights, and that the unborn human has no private property rights. The intruder is analogous to the unborn human in the abortion scenario in other ways. 

&gt;Furthermore, in this case, the intruder's lack of rights creates a morally relevant distinction between your possible world and the real world (you have already agreed that the private property violator himself has private property rights.)

I am really confused. At first you seem to suggest that I believe that the intruder in my scenario has no rights, but then after that you suggest that I believe that he does have rights. Could you please clarify for me? 

&gt;…and that pro-life person would be making a valid argument! This is just one reason why your analogy does not work.

I don't think it would be a valid argument, for I don't think that a person's private property rights includes the right to not be killed when intruding, or being inside someone's private property without any pretense of permission. It would not be valid precisely for the reason that it does not follow from my own principles. 

&gt;Do you think that ""people in the real world"" would consider Charlie saving Lucy's baby to be an immoral act?

When presented with my argument, I think at least some people would consider it to be an immoral act.

479,"&gt; To who? 

I'm not sure whether your question was meant to be rhetorical... but either way, it got me thinking about the resources that exist in the area where I live - and to think about what needs to be done better.

My community has a maternity home run by a private charity - a place where pregnant women can live during their pregnancy, up until their child is around 6 months old. They offer a safe place for women in abusive relationships - or other women facing hardship.

But that wouldn't have helped the woman in story, because she already had another child. There *are* maternity homes that welcome women with other children... but not many of them. At least not that I know of.

There are shelters in my area, including some that are designed to help women with children. But I don't know much about them, and don't know whether they would have been a viable option for this woman. Then again - she'd been told to stay in an abusive relationship. Would she even have *looked* for an alternative?

There are other sorts of support available in my area - material support, mainly. Sometimes help with finding childcare and employment. That *might* have helped the woman in the article. But probably not enough.

So it's worth asking those questions: What sort of support did this woman really need? Why didn't she get it? Who is responsible for providing it? How do we change things so that other women in her position *do* get the help that they need?

&gt; The article makes the point that Irish pro life campaigners do nothing to campaign for help for single mothers

They don't have to. 

Seriously: Am I allowed to campaign for stricter laws against underage drinking without also campaigning for free college tuition? Or should I be accused of only caring about controlling teenagers' bodies, and not really wanting to help them?

Am I allowed to campaign for stricter regulations on car seats without also campaigning for free daycare? Or should I be accused of only wanting to ""control"" car seat manufacturers, and not actually caring about children?

Anti-abortion organizations exist to fight a *specific* social ill - to end abortion. They aren't responsible for ending *every* social ill. Trying to do so would make them largely ineffective.

But Claire, is also doing wrong by blaming this lady. Her awful life is because pf the man, not because of the lady. 

I wouldnt blame Claire for choosing a bad partner, many women, specially teen women fail to see the signals of abusive relationships, we should learn from this experiences, and teach our teens how to be in a healthy relationship. 

I dont know if Claire changed her mind after she notice how abusive was her second partner, the same as the first. But many women, go cycle after cycle of abusive relationships, with or without child.

Rather, I'm interested in calling a spade a spade: abortion is murder. Women and men involved in the business, are murderers of infants.

I'm not looking for some kind of alliance where the murderers agree to, perhaps, make indirect and broad moves towards numerically reducing abortions (which they are trying like crazy to de-stigmatize and even turn into some kind of sacrament/rite-of-passage thing) if only I treat them like good, nice people with whom I have a mere disagreement with.

44,"&gt; The condemnation of the murder goes without saying ... so I'm not sure the point you were trying to make with

&gt;&gt; (otherwise you wouldn't have used the word ""more"")

The point is that the videos did not change your opinion of Planned Parenthood at all. They only gave you more justification (whether real or fabricated) for the outrage you already had about the murder of babies. It was never about doing a fair-minded investigation into whether PP might be doing something illegal or not, it was always just about finding a way to stoke the fires of outrage that people already had. I kinda think that in itself is pretty deceptive (in a rhetorical sense) even if the editing wasn't.

&gt; Let's get to the point, however, the intent of the videos was to highlight the fact that PP sells fetal tissue. So, firstly, they weren't deceptive.

I said ""maybe not even in the broadest strokes or the central claim they were making."" If the basic contention that PP gives fetal tissue and receives dollars is accurate, that doesn't mean they weren't being deceptive at all.

&gt; Oskar Schindler - certainly deceptive, and certainly heroic Pope Francis, when back in Argentina - helped a young man escape from oppression there: http://www.ncregister.com/blog/jimmy-akin/pope-francis-and-lying-to-save-life , one could argue that that's heroic as well.

I think there's a pretty huge difference between lying to the ""bad guys"" (not that I'm consenting that PP fits that label) and lying to the public about what the ""bad guys"" are doing. But it does seem like you're saying here that your basic answer to the core question of whether the ends justify the means is ""yes.""

&gt; Deception and persuasion are two sides of the same coin. Which side they are on often depends on the viewer.

54,"&gt; True or false, the unedited videos were released? True.

True or false, have you ever watched the unedited videos in their entirety?

&gt; What we absolutely do know now, is that PP charged a fee for fetal tissue. We did not know that before, and it makes their practices all the more ghoulish and abhorrent.

It only makes it more ghoulish and abhorrent if it was at all ghoulish and abhorrent to begin with. If Planned Parenthood is convincing people to kill their babies so that they can sell the parts for profit, I agree that's a pretty terrible thing (pushing someone to get an abortion is in opposition to pro-choice ideals as well as pro-life). If Planned Parenthood is helping women who feel unable to go through with a pregnancy, and then selling the remains to facilities that use them to conduct medical research and cure diseases, then I don't find that ghoulish and abhorrent at all. Quite frankly (this, naturally, is where our opinions will differ), I find it heroic.

And that's exactly the problem I have with these videos. From my perspective, they didn't seem like a reason, they seemed like an excuse. What you saw on these videos is not the reason why you think Planned Parenthood is ghoulish and abhorrent (otherwise you wouldn't have used the word ""more""). What legislators saw on these videos is not the reason why they voted to defund Planned Parenthood (they had already been doing that, though less frequently, before the videos came out). It just gave them an excuse to do it more aggressively. 

It's not an exposé, it's simply a rallying cry. Planned Parenthood ""selling baby parts"" is not ghoulish and abhorrent unless you already think the process that turns ""a fetus"" into ""fetal tissue"" is ghoulish and abhorrent to begin with. I don't think you're gonna hear anyone say, ""gosh, I'm all in favor of abortion being legal, but I don't think they should make the fetal tissue available for medical research afterwards!"" All it does is preach to the choir and excite [moral panic](https://legalcatch.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/what-is-moral-panic-and-why-does-it-occur/). 

Anyway, this is all a bit of a digression, so I'll try to get back to the main point. Actually, now that I think about it, you never answered my central question. Independent of ""what we absolutely do know now,"" if you came to know that the makers of these videos were being intentional deceptive (maybe not even in the broadest strokes or the central claim they were making), would you still consider their actions laudable?",1,1490818376,2017-03-29 16:12:56

True or false, employees of Planned Parenthood actually said the words on the video?  True.

True or false, the videos were intended to expose practices of Planned Parenthood?  True.
True or false, the videos were intended to persuade?  True.
True or false, were the shorter videos edited in such a way as to be particularly damaging?  True.

True or false, did Planned Parenthood ""profit"" from the sale of fetal tissue?  Yes, but not illegally (this law is wrong, in my opinion).  Let me finish this thought ... even in a non-profit company, you charge a per hour rate for an employee's time.  Let's say $100/hour.  You only pay that employee, say $33/hour.  What is that remaining $67?  Part of it covers fringe benefits (vacation, sick leave, health care).  Part of it goes to cover the time of non-revenue staff (administrative staff, managers) and facility costs.  Do you know what else is built in to that number?  Fee.  So don't be fooled that PP was just covering ""costs.""  The employee profited from selling their time, and PP covered multiple sources of costs, and without their internal accounting, we can't know if fee was added in to the per hour rate.

&gt;A comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not, suggesting that outlawing the procedure does little to deter women seeking it.

...is a *very* flawed conclusion. 

If you want to know if illegalization decreases abortions, you look at abortion rates pre- and post-illegalization. You don't compare *totally different countries* abortion rates. And this article is just full of these goodies. Take the next line:

&gt;Moreover, the researchers found that abortion was safe in countries where it was legal, but dangerous in countries where it was outlawed

Hmmm maybe because most countries where abortions are illegal are *third-world* countries?

If you look to Ireland -- a first world country -- their abortion rates did decrease when abortion was made illegal. Additionally, abortion rates are lower in states where they're more restricted. And Ireland has some of the best (lowest) maternal mortality rates around. 

So again, I appreciate you at least providing a link. But this is seriously the only link I *ever* see people provide and it's total shite. ",6,1490676239,2017-03-28 00:43:59

92,"But what specifically is hypocritical about being pro-life?  Is it that people who are pro-life are often for small government?  That's not hypocritical, because they often want massively smaller government in many other ways, and also feel that the government is not performing its role of protecting the right to life.

I wouldn't call it an expansion of the government​ for it to do its bare minimum standard of protecting life.  If all the government did was go after murder (including abortion), rape, and theft, and build roads, that would be much smaller than what we have.

Is it that people who are pro-life tend to want to protect life, but don't want to be taxed to pay for it?  That's not hypocritical, because simply not wanting humans to kill other humans does not make you responsible for them -- I'm not responsible for a murderer's victim that got away and lived.

Also wanting to protect life doesn't mean you must be socialist -- I think that claiming pro-life people should pay for babies through taxes is hyperbole, is not logical, and I think socialism causes more people to be poor.  I have donated to help people eat, and if the government didn't take my money and use it to kill brown people (another instance of the government not respecting the right to life), then I would be able to afford to give more.

95,"&gt;Look up Colorado's programs on this.

Colorado's LARC program has been propped up so often as a huge miracle but CO's abortion rate since the program began (2009) has declined at the exact same rate as the whole country. According to AGI CO's abortion rate from 2011-2014 declined 14% which is the exact same as the whole country. CO's teen abortion rate declined by 42% from 2009-2013 but this is only 6 percentage points more than the overall teenage abortion rate decline during the same time period (CDC stats show the teenage abortion rate declined by 36% in those years). And the overall abortion rate decline for 20-24 year old women was 21%, but according to what I calculated (from CO's gov website and CDC stats) CO's 20-24 year old abortion rate declined a bit less during those years, by 15%. So the possible edge CO had with the teen abortion rate decline was balanced out by less edge with the 20-24 year old abortion decline. 

Honestly I'm a bit surprised that the program had such a small effect (if any) on CO's overall abortion rate (relative to national trends) because LARCs are pretty much impossible to mess up and so many teens/young women in CO use them. I'd be interested to know if there's a high discontinuance rate or something, but probably no one will investigate this because everyone has been convinced to believe the program was this huge success that dramatically lowered the abortion rate.

96,"Bill Clinton was big behind the ""safe, legal, and rare"" approach.

If your goal is minimizing the number of unintended pregnancies in the US, in order to minimize the number of abortions, some great ways to do that include funding comprehensive sex ed and giving free access to contraceptives for young women, especially long-acting reversible contraceptives like IUDs and Nexplanon.  Look up Colorado's programs on this.

So that half of your idea is great.  Unfortunately, abstinence-only education does not reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, and the political movements behind anti-abortion initiatives in the US tend not to get behind sex ed that isn't abstinence-only.

Actually, speaking as an abortion provider, the docs who provide abortions are also generally working the hardest to prevent them.  Doctors in most specialties are trying to put themselves out of business.  If I didn't put in IUDs and do tubal ligations, there would be more abortions (and deliveries), but I wouldn't be happier.

So now for the other half of your plan: tax it.  Anti-abortion legislative bodies are already increasing the cost of abortions in a lot of ways.  Decreasing the number of abortion providers through TRAP laws so that patients have to travel farther and 72-hr waiting periods requiring patients take more time off of work.  These incur costs in time and money that not all can afford.

The end result is that women of means have access to reproductive control and poor women do not.  For somebody like me, who believes that it should cost them nothing or close to nothing?  That's not a solution I'm happy with.  Why does a rich woman have more of a right to an abortion than a poor woman?

That said, please go ahead and tax the rich and throw the money behind free LARC programs everywhere.  It would drastically cut down on the demand for abortions.

I mean, uh... oh no, that would be horrible.  I as an abortion provider would hate that.  Gosh, please don't do that!

116,"Respectfully, it's not bogus.

The author picks spina bifida as an example.  Spina bifida is one of very few examples of fetal anomalies with potential for prenatal intervention.

Let's pick another example -- Down syndrome.  Let's say you're in a state where this law has been passed, and your provider fails to make a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.  For example, they forget to order screening bloodwork, or fail to notice a thickened nuchal fold on ultrasound.

Following delivery, you want some recourse.  A major mechanism for recourse in the US for patients to take recourse when their doctors fail them is to sue them.  You sue your doctor.  You need to demonstrate that you suffered some harm as the result of your doctor's negligence.

When I'm counseling my patient on prenatal screening and its benefits, I include the option of termination.  For patients for whom that isn't an option, I discuss the benefits of knowing in advance, and planning -- preparing emotionally and learning about the condition.

When you bring suit, that's the extent of your claim for harm -- you missed out on five months of research about trisomy 21 prior to birth.  How much value does that have?  Debatable, but definitely a lot less than losing the opportunity to terminate.

Okay, okay, but I'm on /r/prolife here.  An ""opportunity to terminate"" is an opportunity to murder in your book.  So let's switch it to something incompatible with life -- bilateral renal agenesis.  There will not be intrauterine pulmonary development.  But, because of the doctor's failure to diagnose, the patient carries a pregnancy to term.  That is damage without benefit -- there was never an opportunity for life and the patient has gone the unnecessary risk of gestation and parturition as a result.

This law denies them the opportunity to bring that suit for a meaningful sum of money, which is functionally equivalent to lowering the standard of care, barring extraordinary action from the medical board of Texas.

For example, abortionfacts.com is quite simply going to be dismissed out of hand by most prochoicers that you try to convince with it. If they've never heard of it, even the name will probably make them dismiss what you're saying. If they get curious and actually check it out, they'll immediately dismiss it as prolife propaganda. Realizing that, it would be better to simply cite the actual survey directly, rather than add the complication of a biased intermediary.

Trent Horn, a prolife advocate who works at Catholic Answers, is an excellent example of this. His book *Persuasive Prolife* goes through a number of prochoice arguments and illustrates how to respond and debunk them, and he always chooses his sources carefully.

The Muslim religion oppresses women, considering them property and worth half the value of men (literally in their Qur'an), and it isn't correct. 

The flaws in the bodily autonomy are that if you look up the definition of autonomy it can easily be argued that children, employees, the developmentally disabled, and the elderly with dementia, are not autonomous. These groups I have mentioned do not have bodily autonomy either (well employees would in this example) because they don't have, or have limited self determination over their bodies. These groups still clearly have human rights. They are still people. And human rights definitions say that such rights can't be denied based on status because they are inalienable. These definitions say that every human is entitled to human rights simply because they are human. Being unborn is just a status, the unborn are still human. Abortion is a human rights violation. Arguing that abortion is somehow justified by some bodily autonomy argument is ridiculous because not everyone even has autonomy or ""bodily autonomy"" anyway. Making claims that some group's ""rights"" take precedent over another group's rights simply because one has autonomy and one does not, is terrible.

It would be like you driving a car, and then a person appears and tells you to drive the car against your will. In the case of driving the car, you have to drive a certain amount of time and have that .02% chance of dying from a car accident.

Comparing pregnancy to a car accident is... imperfect.  But I'll try to explain: you are driving a car in a strange alternate world where people like to get into accidents with other people, but they still have a chance of getting hurt when they get into accidents.  You know that when you do it, there's a chance you will get injured in an accident.  You may not have wanted to, and the accident may not have been your fault, but you knew that there was a chance that you could get hurt.  If you don't want to get injured in an accident, then you can install things to protect yourself (seat belts, airbags, etc... helpful, but not perfect protection), or just not drive a car.

And in the event that you get injured, you don't get to kill someone else to make you better.  No matter how much your injury hurts, no matter how disabled you are, no matter how adversely it affects your career or life, you don't get to kill someone else to make yourself better.

Now this analogy breaks down, because driving is something that is required to get to your job, school, etc... That's not true about sex.

And to be clear:

* Driving your car / getting into a car accident = having sex

* Getting injured in a car accident = getting pregnant

* Airbags, seatbelts, etc... = Contraceptives

* Killing another person to make yourself better = abortion.

174,"&gt; I would have to say that abortion isn't an active choice, but a byproduct of the person to not want to give birth or suffer from pregnancy.  If it was only an active choice to kill someone, people just wouldn't do it. 

Abortion is absolutely an active choice.  To say otherwise would be asinine.  Women are perfectly capable of carrying the child to term, or not getting pregnant in the first place (either through birth control or abstinence).  

Again, you cannot to consent to a risk free version of a real choice.  You don't get to consent to sex only if it's amazing.  That would be stupid.  And you have to accept the consequences of your actions.  If you can take actions which do not harm anyone to alleviate your consequences, that's fine.  But as soon as you start trying to harm someone else to alleviate the results of your own choices, your actions become immoral.

&gt; But in the case of abortion one of them actively threatens another person's livelihood. 

Again, this is not a valid argument.  You already donated your organs (loaned in this case).  You don't get to kill them to get your organs back (sooner).  The mother chose to provide for the child when she got pregnant.  She now has an obligation to carry the child to term, at which point she is free to give it up for adoption if she wants.  To say that it is ok to kill a child because they will be a burden on you is pure evil.  Should we start going around killing the elderly, the disabled, and the orphans?  They're a burden on us as a society, and through taxes, each person individually.

&gt; A person is in fact, risking their life to keep another person alive.

No.  there is a 0.02% chance of dying in childbirth.  That's about the same odds as dying in a car accident.

&gt; Just because there's a 0.5% chance of something happening, doesn't mean that they would want to accept the risks at all though. Humans are intrinsically more complicated by that. There's always a certain percentage of something bad happening to someone at any given time. If that's the case, shouldn't a person do absolutely nothing that could potentially threaten their lives? Of course not. People take risks, but this becomes complicated when you involve the lives of other people in it.

Absolutely people take risks.  Some people choose to do activities with a high risk of harm (boxing, base jumping, race car driving, etc...), others choose to avoid those.  But if someone gets hurt while doing on of these, they don't get to kill an innocent bystander, even if that will improve their life.  They have to live with the consequences.  If you broke your leg skydiving, you don't get to kill someone else to make it better.

&gt; Well in that case, you are taking something out of a person without their consent. So no? Is there any way in which the person can take another person's nose? Only if the person who did the nose job had a chance of dying and took the normal person's nose to save their own life, then I would say there is no other means of making that situation moral.

So if I added the fact that the person who got the nose job is a salesman, and their face is directly tied to their ability to work and their career trajectory, would that change anything?  What if the injury was exceptionally painful for the entire year they were recovering?  What if the disfigurement made them a pariah in society, would it be ok to take their nose then?  

What if removing someone's nose to fix the first person killed the donor?  Would that change any of the answers here?

At the risk of putting words into your mouth, I think it is a fairly safe assumption that you would not find it moral to take the nose of the bystander for any of the above reasons, especially if we change it so that removing the donor nose kills the donor.

So lifestyle, income, job trajectory, pain, inconvenience, and rejection from society, do not change the fact that taking someone else's life to make any of the above areas better.

If this is true, then how can the argument for abortion be ""but it's painful to give birth"", ""it hurts the mothers career"", or ""it is inconvenient for her""?  These make no difference.

**Either you are killing a baby, in which case abortion is evil, or you are removing a clump of cells, in which case abortion is your right.**

If you want to challenge me on the personhood of an unborn child, we can have a discussion there, but if you accept that an unborn child is a person, then you absolutely cannot justify giving one person the legal right to murder them, even if that person is their mother, and the child is still in her womb.

177,"&gt;Here's how I see it. Ignoring the morality of the matter, if a pregnant women were to want to abort, but can't due to laws or isn't provided with any means of abortion, then that would trap her into a situation where she has absolutely no choice to give birth. It might be natural, but 9 months mental stress and physical inconveniences to a person who absolutely does not want to give birth would be essentially giving birth against their own will or forcing them to give birth.

And here is how we see it. Imagine, conjoined twins. Do we force them to stay attached because we do not allow one sibling to kill the other on demand and without apology. 

The reality is that conjoined twins can attempt separation when one of their lives are at risk. Not just because it might be inconvenient to stay attached.

Here;s another scenario. You are on a plane. The guy beside you starts coughing and you over hear him say he has the flu. The flu can be terrible. It can cause all kinds of short or long term complications. And it has a much higher chance of causing death than a regular pregnancy. Does the state force you into getting the flu because you are not allowed to legally KILL the guy?

&gt;What exactly do the laws in pro-life developing countries look like for potential mothers who want abortions? I don't see how you would enforce it other than not providing legal means of doing it. And also, women can just as easily die from birth as well as abortion too.

Easy. Abortions are not legal unless the mother's life is threatened (ex: etoptic pregnancy).

In 99% of the cases of abortion, women have the bodily autonomy to consent to having sex and using contraception.  How come we ignore that fact until they are pregnant?

If a woman cannot afford (multiple) forms of contraception or the results of sex (a baby), maybe she should re-evaluate the situation.  It's not like if you do not have sex, you're going to die.

&gt; Given that GOP legislators are currently working on no longer requiring insurers to cover prenatal care, I don't think we need more disincentives.

Straw man and fear mongering.  

All of the decent proposals I have seen come out of the GOP gives people and insurance the choice to have parental care/contraception covered.  There are also arguments that some healthcare and other social welfare should take priority over others - for example, cancer treatments and food stamps/WIC.  I don't think asking people to have a little self control in other areas is a big ask.  I find it ironic that people who claim they are ""pro-choice"" ignore these facts.

Moreover, this would create a huge disincentive for women to receive prenatal care if it meant that they could be given medical advice that they would legally mandated to follow.  Which of course would have adverse impacts on many many more women and babies.

Even if that pain was equivalent to torture (given that some women intentionally get pregnant multiple times, this is unlikely), would that be enough for you to get to take back your organs?

No?

A closer example is that we do not investigate medical staff every time someone dies at a hospital.  We assume that the staff did everything they could to save the patient.  The onus of proof is on you to make the claim that the staff was somehow negligent and didn't follow proper procedures.

224,"&gt;Well, first of all there is no such thing as forcing birth. That is a natural biological consequence. It's like throwing up, or peeing or pooing.


Here's how I see it. Ignoring the morality of the matter, if a pregnant women were to want to abort, but can't due to laws or isn't provided with any means of abortion, then that would trap her into a situation where she has absolutely no choice to give birth. It might be natural, but 9 months mental stress and physical inconveniences to a person who absolutely does not want to give birth would be essentially giving birth against their own will or forcing them to give birth.


What exactly do the laws in pro-life developing countries look like for potential mothers who want abortions? I don't see how you would enforce it other than not providing legal means of doing it.  And also, women can just as easily die from birth as well as abortion too.

225,"&gt; It depends how much you want to restrict a person of their rights for the well being of another life. 

My answer is that we use existing laws to do this. Self defense is a good guide line. A person has a right to defend themselves in situations where there is an imminent and serious risk of harm or death.

&gt;Since bodily autonomy doesn't matter for a pregnant person in a pro-life view, to what extent would you want to prevent any chance of the fetus from dying if a person decides to abort? 

This is incorrect. Bodily autonomy does matter. But it does not take precedence over the right to life (the right to not be killed).
Generally, prolifers believe that the abortionist should be criminally punished since they are actually doing the killing.

&gt;Since forcing women to give birth is ok for the protection of a life, what punishment should you give to people who try to attempt abortions? 

Well, first of all there is no such thing as forcing birth. That is a natural biological consequence. It's like throwing up, or peeing or pooing. No one forces those things. They happen automatically.

Locking them up for their own safety?

I think the easiest answer would be to follow first world prolife nations and their already existing laws. The reality is that most of the rest of the world already restricts abortions. And developed countries with prolife laws have the benefit of higher maternal rates and women aren't dying nor are they ending up behind bars.

337,"So when this discussion started, you said that reproduction was a ""*biological* term and feature of our species.""  You said our dispute was ""about the *biological reality* of when a new and living human organism begins to exist.""  My original request was for a ""non-partisan, non-theistic, *scientific biological authority* from the web that holds that the reproductive process ends at conception.  And now you're relying on dictionary.com as an authority?  And you have the nerve to call me intellectually dishonest?


Well, let's just take a closer look at what dictionary.com has to say.  Reproduce means ""to produce one or more other individuals of (a given kind of organism) by some process of generation or propagation, sexual or asexual.""

Let's see how dictionary.com defines [individual](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/individual?s=t)  

Definition 1 ""a single human being, as distinguished from a group"" doesn't apply because the ""reproduce"" definition isn't trying to make a distinction from any group (in fact it says, ""one or more"").

Definition 2 says that an individual is a ""person.""  In that case, your reliance on dictionary.com proves my point, not yours.

Definition 5a says that for BIOLOGICAL PURPOSES, an individual is a ""single organism *capable of independent existence.*""  Well, we know that a zygote is incapable of an independent existence.  So definition 5a also proves my point, not yours.

Your Wikipedia definition isn't much help either.  The page states that ""Reproduction is the biological process by which new individual organisms – ""offspring"" – are produced from their ""parents"".  Which is true; reproduction does produce new individual organisms.  Unfortunately, nothing about that is inconsistent with the notion that the reproductive process includes birth (and your definition does use the word ""process"").

&gt; Thinking anything else is just some mystical, philosophical crap that has no bearing in ontological reality.

It's not mystical philosophical crap when I have scientific sources validating my conclusion (not to mention your own reliance on dictionary.com).

&gt; If human reproduction means creating a new, living and individual human organism then the reproducing itself is complete when that organism begins to exist.

Go check your dictionary.com definition of ""individual"" again.

I've produced 11 sources that all say that the reproductive process includes birth.  You've said some of my sources are not credible, but simply saying it doesn't make it so.  You've said that I'm misinterpreting my sources, but you've provided no further explanation.  You've drawn a analogy to the digestive system which supported my conclusion, not yours.  In the meantime, you still have yet to provide non-partisan, non-theistic, scientific biological authorities from the web that hold that the reproductive process ends at conception.  Now you're saying that I'm trying to move the ""goalposts"" without any further explanation of what you mean.  Repeating that the reproductive process ends at conception over and over again doesn't make it so.  You need to make a serious argument here.  If my sources aren't credible, then make an argument.  If I have misinterpreted them, then demonstrate why your interpretation is superior.  Find some non-partisan, non-theistic, scientific biological authorities that support your conclusion.  You are putting a ridiculously minuscule amount of effort into either proving me wrong or proving yourself right.  You need to do better than this.  I understand that you may be strapped for time…so take you time, but get the job done.

347,"&gt; I don't see why the human needs to be born in order to be considered reproduced or created. It makes no sense whatsoever and from a biological standpoint being born does not change the fact that the living and human organism already exists.

That the living human organism already exists doesn't mean that the reproductive process has concluded.  Once again, all of my sources support the conclusion that that the reproductive process includes birth.  If you need more time to vet my sources, then by all means take it.  I'll be here.  And I can find even more sources on the web - it's quite easy in fact.

Meanwhile, incredibly, five days after I first asked you to provide a non-partisan, non-theistic scientific biological authority from the web that holds that the reproductive process terminates at conception, you have failed to do so.  25 or so authorities have been cited in this discussion; none of them support the view that the reproductive process terminates at conception.  Mine all support the view that the reproductive process includes birth.  Once again, you are entitled to believe whatever you want to believe; but when this type of thing happens in an adversarial discussion, the reasonable conclusion is that you've got it wrong.

And as I said earlier, conception results in a zygote.  The zygote exists as a living thing.  But the reproductive process still has more to go.  It's not done yet.

If what you are saying is true, then it's also true that a woman successfully reproduces every time she miscarries; she successfully reproduces every time the fertilized egg winds up as a speck on her tampon.  This would be inconsistent with the definition of Net Reproduction Rate, which is defined as [average number of daughters that would be **born** to a female (or a group of females) if she passed through her lifetime conforming to the age-specific fertility and mortality rates of a given year.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_reproduction_rate). 

&gt; I really don't see how you can argue against this without bringing up some subjective philosophical concept?

I don't have to.  I now have 11 sources in support of the view that the reproductive process includes birth.  Make your case to the doctors, scientists, and other medical professionals who acknowledge that the reproductive process does not terminate at conception.

&gt; Do you really believe that from a biological standpoint the living and human organism does not exist until birth?

That's not what I'm saying nor is it what I believe.  Once again, I'm saying (with the support of my authorities) that at the time conception results in that living human being, the reproductive process is not complete.  Because the reproductive process is ongoing, abortion constitutes reproductive choice.

The longer this discussion goes on without you producing non-partisan, non-theistic scientific biological authorities from the web that holds that the reproductive process terminates at conception, the more credibility you lose.  At some point you are going to have to acknowledge that among all the authorities we've discussed, you are the *only one* who believes that the reproductive process terminates as conception.  You are entitled to that belief, but it's yours alone.",1,1489944943,2017-03-19 13:35:43

355,"&gt; And as I said before the reproductive system’s functions and reproducing itself are two separate things. We are discussing the latter.

But it is through the functioning of the reproductive system that reproduction occurs.  So when we discuss the reproductive process, we are discussing the functions of the reproductive system.  

&gt; Here’s an example, my digestive system includes breaking down food and then expelling it. But the expelling part is not synonymous with digesting itself.

But the expelling part is what ends the digestive process (just as birth ends the reproductive process).  The digestive process hasn't completed until the food is expelled through your anus.  [""The rectum stores stool until it pushes stool out of the body during a bowel movement.""](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works).  Matter is still in the large intestine before it reaches the anus, and it is in the large intestine that [water and vitamins are absorbed and antibodies are produced](http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-the-Large-Intestine-Do.aspx).  

If you were looking for a counterexample, the digestive system is not the way to go.  You're trying really hard to divorce ""reproductive process"" from ""reproductive system functioning,"" and it requires mental gymnastics to reach that conclusion.  

&gt; So according to you a vagina’s sole purpose is reproduction? As a woman who enjoys having sex I know this isn’t true. Sorry but I don’t really see how this is a logical conclusion that follows from the premise.

What are you talking about?  By saying ""This would render the uterus and vagina as organs whose functions exists outside of the reproductive process. We know this isn't true,"" I was making the point that these organs are indeed part of the reproductive process, *not* that they only have a reproductive purpose.  

Except in the case of Conservapedia, your critique of my authorities is either weak or unsubstantiated.

&gt; First off, (John W. Kimball) not a credible source.  Secondly, did you notice he includes lactation? Wouldn’t that mean killing your baby before lactation take take place (can happen up to 5 days after birth) is reproductive freedom too? 

Simply saying he's not a credible source doesn't make it so.  Make an argument.  Secondly, neither I nor anyone else with whom I agree claims that ""reproductive choice"" or ""abortion"" refers to the right to kill a human being post-natally.  Don't ascribe to me meanings of ""reproductive freedom"" or ""reproductive choice"" that I haven't adopted.  My position is that calling abortion ""reproductive choice"" is accurate because abortion (i.e., terminating a pregnancy) occurs during the reproductive process.

&gt; Not a credible source. A random nurse on the internet is not considered a valid biological source.

Bio on Edward Thomas [""Combining his medical and journalism experience, Edward Thomas has been writing professionally since 1990 and currently provides content for several websites including eHow.com. Thomas was a featured health writer for the Knoxville Sentinal for 7 years and holds a Masters in Nursing from the University of Tennessee.""](http://www.livestrong.com/article/41184-process-human-reproduction/)  What makes you think he is a ""random nurse?""

&gt; (Encyclopedia Britannica) states, “Human reproductive system, organ system by which humans reproduce and bear live offspring.”. Do you notice they distinguish between reproducing and bearing offspring. See above, reproductive system is not synonymous with reproducing.

That's interesting because earlier in your comment you wrote ""And as I said before the reproductive system’s functions and reproducing itself are two separate things.""  NOW it seems that for purposes of Encyclopedia Britannica, the reproductive system and reproducing itself ARE the same thing!  Choose one, you can't have it both ways!

In any case, the following sentence on the Encyclopedia Britannica page makes clear what the essential features of human reproduction are - and birth comes in at stage #6.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; The [Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis} page does not say that at all. It actually clearly separates reproduction and development as distinct things.

No it doesn't.  The page is entitled ""Human Reproduction and Development.""  Subheading II is entitled ""Stages of Development of an Animal Embryo.""  Number 2 under this subheading is FERTILIZATION.  And at the bottom of this Subheading it says ""Week 36-40 - Partuition…""  It's all part of the same reproductive process.  If you still believe that the page separates reproduction and development as distinct things, demonstrate how this is so.

&gt; (Conservapedia) Again, not a credible source.

I'll give you the benefit of a doubt on this - so here are a few more sources.  See [Healthline.com](http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/female-reproductive-system#seoBlock) which describes the female reproductive system as responsible for the female part of the reproductive process.  [Although a man’s sperm is needed to reproduce, the fetus develops inside a woman and *she delivers the child.*].  Healthline.com has a team of 10 medical reviewers with various medical degrees (need to click on ""Meet our Team"")

[This page published by Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/patients-families/health-library/healthdoc/female-reproductive-system?id=20090) states that the female reproductive system enables a woman to ""give birth""

As written by in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, [""…the vexing fact that from *fertilization to birth*, why the *reproductive process* in humans should be fraught with failure remains entrenched in the realms of the explainable and unexplainable.""](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-017-0878-6).  This is written by [Professor David Albertini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-albertini-2791668) who is the Director of Laboratories and Senior Scientist at The Center for Human Reproduction in New York.

Your critque of my sources aside, there's one huge issue that you are completely ignoring.  You haven't produced a single source in support of the proposition that reproduction terminates at fertilization.  That's your burden.  You still need to establish this in order to establish your conclusion that abortion does not involve reproductive choice.  You haven't even come close.

&gt; You seem to be trying to confirm your bias and you refuse to acknowledge that there is a distinction between, reproducing itself and the systems used to reproduce.

I'm not refusing to acknowledge that at all.  What I am saying, however, is that the reproductive process is inclusive of all the events that occur in the systems used to reproduce.

&gt; But reproducing does not involve birth…

It's not worth it now to veer off on the ""personhood"" tangent so allow me to amend my response to your earlier question ""When you use the term ""reproduction"" what is it that you are referring to reproducing?"" let me just amend my answer to a ""living born human being.""

&gt; But do they both have equal intrinsic value?

I don't know what you mean by ""intrinsic value.""  I will say that in my view, the ""value"" of human being increases during gestation, and at birth, the post-natal human acquires the additional value that accompanies personhood.  But let's not talk about personhood just yet.

&gt; Well, this is your own opinion about personhood which I don’t accept. I’d rather stick to talking about biology and real physical phenomena than discuss philosophical opinions. You are also creating a circular argument here. 

Your the one who ""asked"" me ""how a fetus/preborn child is changed in a morally significant way by being born (or exiting the vaginal canal)""!!!  So if you'd rather ""stick to talking about biology and real physical phenomena,"" then don't ask me about morally significant changes!

&gt; But they aren’t person. So what is a person according to you?

A person is a living born human being.  But let's not veer off on this tangent - we're not done with the ""reproductive process"" issue quite yet.",1,1489891482,2017-03-18 22:44:42

357,Powerful. ,6,1489885365,2017-03-18 21:02:45
358,"&gt;The female reproductive system has two functions: The first is to produce egg cells, and the second is to protect and nourish the fetus until birth.. The ""reproductive system"" includes a ""system"" to nourish the fetus until birth. So yes, this source supports the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

And as I said before the reproductive system’s functions and reproducing itself are two separate things. We are discussing the latter.

Here’s an example, my digestive system includes breaking down food and then expelling it. But the expelling part is not synonymous with digesting itself.

&gt;The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the vagina, which leads from the vulva, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the uterus, which holds the developing fetus; and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova. The reproductive process can't possibly terminate at conception because conception occurs in the fallopian tubes. This would render the uterus and vagina as organs whose functions exists outside of the reproductive process. We know this isn't true.

So according to you a vagina’s sole purpose is reproduction? As a woman who enjoys having sex I know this isn’t true. Sorry but I don’t really see how this is a logical conclusion that follows from the premise.

&gt;Professor John W. Kimball has published a page on Sexual Reproduction in Humans. According to his page, the reproductive process includes birth and lactation. Thus, this source also supports the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

First off, not a credible source. Secondly, did you notice he includes lactation? Wouldn’t that mean killing your baby before lactation take take place (can happen up to 5 days after birth) is reproductive freedom too? I’m not sure why you can’t see the error in your thinking? Having milk produced in your breast and reproducing are clearly different things.

&gt;Edward Thomas, who holds a master's degree in nursing, has also written on the process of human reproduction.. He writes ""once birth has occurred, the fetus is an infant and is considered the final step of reproduction."" If birth is the final step of reproduction, then reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

Not a credible source. A random nurse on the internet is not considered a valid biological source.

&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica describes the essential feature of human reproduction as including birth of the child and expulsion of the placenta.. Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

It states, “Human reproductive system, organ system by which humans reproduce and bear live offspring.”. Do you notice they distinguish between reproducing and bearing offspring. See above, reproductive system is not synonymous with reproducing.

&gt;According to this page published by Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, human reproduction and development ends between week 36 and 40 with ""Partruition."" Partruition is the action or process of giving birth to offspring. Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

The page does not say that at all. It actually clearly separates reproduction and development as distinct things. I’m beginning to think you just can’t take your bias lenses off. 

&gt;Even Conservapedia, the online encyclopedia that champions conservative values, defines human reproduction as the process by which children are conceived and born.. Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

Again, not a credible source. And again, human reproduction processes or systems are not the same thing as reproduction itself. As noted above.

&gt;So don't tell me that my sources don't support the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth. That's just a flat out lie.

I am telling you that. You seem to be trying to confirm your bias and you refuse to acknowledge that there is a distinction between, reproducing itself  and the systems used to reproduce.

Isn’t there a difference between digesting itself and the digestive system as a whole? As mentioned above expelling digested food is not the same thing as the digesting itself. Do you get now what I’m saying?  

&gt;If human reproduction includes birth (as all my sources indicate), and birth is the last step to creating a person, then human reproduction is the process through which a new person is created. The reasoning here is syllogistic.

But reproducing does not involve birth, and birth does not mark a last step in creating a new person so I don’t accept this logic at all.
Biologically, human reproduction involves creating a new and living organism. It has nothing to do with personhood. That is a philosophical term and has no bearing on the biology.

&gt;They both have value to me.

But do they both have equal intrinsic value?

&gt;You have to keep reading. I said ""The first reason is the physical separation. It is only after birth that a second human body exists apart from the one in which it formed."" When conjoined twins are born, they are separate from the body in which they formed, and thus, persons.

Well, this is your own opinion about personhood which I don’t accept. I’d rather stick to talking about biology and real physical phenomena than discuss philosophical opinions. You are also creating a circular argument here. 

&gt;Again you have to keep on reading. I said ""In contrast, a fetus's interactions with the outside world are non-existent, or at the very most, de minimis.""

I still don’t see how this is morally significant. It’s just your opinion and I don’t agree.

&gt;A baby born in a coma is still interacting with the outside world.
Not anymore than a preborn child. But regardless, I still do not see why this factor is morally significant. 

&gt;A baby in the amniotic sac has separated from the woman. 
Again see conjoined twins example.

&gt;We can't kill them. In any case, our cultural association of personhood with birth manifests from the ways in which birth is most commonly experienced. That there may be some exceptions to the considerations I have set forth does not alter this.

If you want to change courses and talk about personhood then I think it would help if you clearly set out your definition of a person.

402,"# Rape and Incest
---

In my world, rape and incest are not valid excuses for abortion.  We can kill/castrate rapists, not victims, and not innocent bystanders.

Suppose you got into a mugging, and your nose was significantly damaged.  And suppose our two options are:

1. Take the nose off of someone else's face (without their consent), and surgically implant it onto your face, or

2. Wait 9 months for you to naturally heal

Would we even consider the first option?  Even if the person was in a sales job and their face was important to their career?  Even if their career trajectory might be permanently and irreversibly harmed?

No.  We cannot harm someone else to fix you, even if the reason you got hurt was not your fault.  So if we postulate that abortion is wrong in the general case, abortion is also wrong in the specific case of rape.

I realize this puts rape victims in a very unfortunate situation, but I don't think this makes them second class citizens.  As said above, you don't get to harm someone else to make up for something that happened to you, even if that something was not your fault.  If there was a way to make rapists carry the baby to term, I think that would be a very fitting way to punish them, but that's just not possible.

&amp;nbsp;

While I've heard it said that incest should also be an acceptable case for abortion, I've never heard the logic.  The only thing I can think of is the possibility of birth defects.  If that is the only reason, then that is absurd.  We don't kill disabled people because they are disabled.  Their present status (born or unborn) is irrelevant.

&amp;nbsp;

# Prosecution Targets
---

In my perfect world, we don't go after the mothers who obtain abortions, but the people who provide them.  Someone selling abortifacients or preforming alley-way/back-of-the-van abortions would be shut down and arrested as a mass murderer.  If we find someone who carried out an abortion, and they have a list of clients, I would be open to prosecuting the mothers then, but only because the abortion provider had strong evidence that they received one.

Basically, we would investigate abortions through the providers, not through the mothers.

&amp;nbsp;

# Prosecution Methods
---

I would be open to investigations into women who miscarried only under the following (or a more restrictive) 3 phase system:

&amp;nbsp;

## &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Phase 1

Surface level investigation.  If publicly available information (tweets, public fb posts, reddit posts under their real name, news interviews, etc...) lead to a reasonable belief that this woman would seek out an abortion, then investigations could continue to the next phase.

Reasonable belief in this case would be fairly rigorous, but ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" rigorous.  Things like posting ""If I ever get pregnant, I'm getting an abortion"", or public record (interview, tweet, etc...) that indicated you had an abortion before would be sufficient.  If investigators found lots of smaller things, it would also be acceptable in place of a single large thing.

&amp;nbsp;

## &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Phase 2

At this level of investigation, warrants could be obtained (not allowed in phase 1), but only for non-obtrusive searches.  Full access to private or restricted posts on social media, emails, phone records, web history, that sort of thing.  Nothing directly interfacing with the mother.  At this point in the investigation, the mother should not be aware of the investigation into her.

At this stage, significant (but not ""beyond a reasonable doubt"") evidence would have to be obtained before moving on to phase 3.  Phone records showing you repeatedly contacted a known abortion provider (after they were illegal.  Calling PP before they were made illegal would not qualify), text messages to the father saying you are thinking about getting an abortion, web searches for ""how to abortion"", etc...  Things that might not quite be enough to convict in court, but are non-trivial.

&amp;nbsp;

## &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Phase 3

This would be the first point where the investigation interfaces with the mother.  The first time the mother finds out that she is being investigated.  Before this, no contact would be allowed with the mother, since we assume it was just a miscarriage until strongly suggested otherwise.

At this point, the investigation would proceed just like a normal murder investigation, with extra care and benefit of the doubt given to the grieving mother.

&amp;nbsp;

# Conclusion
---

This way, the vast majority of actual miscarriages would be weeded out in the first two phases, and a grieving mother would not receive questions like ""did you kill your child?"" unless there was a reasonable chance that they would.  And an investigation like this would not even start unless there was some belief that it was intentional.  If it seems obvious that it was accidental, or there seems to be nothing to suggest otherwise, then they wouldn't even start an investigation.

However, as I said above, this would not be the primary method of investigation.  And I would have no problem with simply not allowing investigations into abortion recipients at all.  I am still somewhat undecided on this point.  But if we were to allow them, they would have to be at least this restrictive on the investigators, and at least this considerate to the women who have miscarried.",2,1489775616,2017-03-17 14:33:36

431,"&gt;&gt; All of my sources support the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

&gt; None of your credible sources say that.

Yes, they all support the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.  But in case you missed it:

[The female **reproductive system** has two functions: The first is to produce egg cells, and the second is to protect and nourish the fetus until **birth**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reproductive_system).  The ""reproductive system"" includes a ""system"" to nourish the fetus **until birth**.  So yes, this source supports the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

[The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the vagina, which leads from the vulva, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the uterus, which holds the developing fetus; and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reproductive_system)  The reproductive process can't possibly terminate at conception because conception occurs in the fallopian tubes. This would render the uterus and vagina as organs whose functions exists outside of the reproductive process. We know this isn't true.

Professor John W. Kimball has published a page on [Sexual **Reproduction** in Humans.](http://www.biology-pages.info/S/Sexual_Reproduction.html)  According to his page, the reproductive process includes **birth** and lactation.  Thus, this source also supports the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

Edward Thomas, who holds a master's degree in nursing, has also [written on the process of human reproduction.](http://www.livestrong.com/article/41184-process-human-reproduction/).  He writes ""once **birth** has occurred, the fetus is an infant and is considered the **final step of reproduction**.""  If birth is the final step of reproduction, then reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

Encyclopedia Britannica describes the essential feature of **human reproduction** as including [**birth** of the child and expulsion of the placenta.](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-reproductive-system).  Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

According to [this page](https://www.biology.iupui.edu/biocourses/N100/2k4ch39repronotes.html) published by Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, human **reproduction** and development ends between week 36 and 40 with ""Partruition.""  Partruition is [the action or process of giving **birth** to offspring](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parturition).  Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

Even [Conservapedia](http://www.conservapedia.com/Main_Page), the online encyclopedia that champions conservative values, defines human **reproduction** as [the process by which children are conceived and **born**.](http://www.conservapedia.com/Human_reproduction).  Thus this page also supports the proposition that human reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.

So don't tell me that my sources don't support the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth.  That's just a flat out lie.

&gt; Biological reproduction does not refer to producing new persons only new and living organisms.

If human reproduction includes birth (as all my sources indicate), and birth is the last step to creating a person, then human reproduction is the process through which a new person is created.  The reasoning here is syllogistic.  

&gt; Assuming a born human being has intrinsic value, what is it about the intrinsic nature of the born human that gives it moral worth as opposed to a human being in utero?

They both have value to me.

&gt; The first thing you mentioned is physical separation. Well, conjoined twins come to mind. They are not physically separated but I doubt you’d say they have no value or personhood because of it.

You have to keep reading.  I said ""The first reason is the physical separation. It is only after birth that a *second human body exists apart from the one in which it formed.*""  When conjoined twins are born, they are separate from the body in which they formed, and thus, persons.

&gt; The second thing you mention is interaction with the outside world. Notwithstanding the fact that a human fetus interacts with the outside world (just imagine a father feeling his child kick, he pushes the foot of the baby and the baby pushes back) 

Again you have to keep on reading.  I said ""In contrast, a fetus's interactions with the outside world are non-existent, *or at the very most, de minimis.*""

&gt; Think about a baby born in a coma or the umbilical sac, are they really worthless because technically they haven;t interacted with the outside world yet? Can we kill them?

A baby born in a coma is still interacting with the outside world.  A baby in the amniotic sac has separated from the woman.  We can't kill them.  In any case, our cultural association of personhood with birth manifests from the ways in which birth is most commonly experienced.  That there may be some exceptions to the considerations I have set forth does not alter this.

And I never said that fetuses are worthless.

I agree this sums it up very well.

&gt;If ""reproduction"" involves processes occurring after conception, then the choice to abort concerns ""reproductive choice."" All of my sources support the proposition that reproduction involves processes at least up until birth. Thus, despite your comment, all of my sources deal squarely with the point of the discussion.

Nope. None of your credible sources say that. In fact, they all agree that once fertilization occurs a new and living human being begins to exist. Once the new human organism begin to exist the reproduction has taken place. Everything after that is just the development of the entity or organism that has been produced.
This time and natural phenomena may be considered a part of our reproductive systems (which is what your sources refer to) and they would be rightly so. Just like ejaculation is part of a males' reproductive system. But it would be wrong to say that ejaculation is a part of the reproducing itself. If you can't get this then I'm not sure anything I say will convince you.

&gt;I am referring to the process through which a new person is created. If you are uncertain as to what that may be, simply click on any of the sources I have provided.

And therein lie the confusion. Biological reproduction does not refer to producing new persons only new and living organisms.  
You are making up your own definition of human reproduction which is a biological process not some philosophical idea.

&gt;No — looking back, you wrote ""And I don't really see the relevance to the question either?"" which is a declarative sentence with a question mark at the end of it. That's not a question.

Fair enough. I had a look back and it seems you did ask me. And yes, it’s a declarative statement. But is is clearly being used to ask a question. Either way, this sidesteps the issue. 

&gt;As far as how a fetus/preborn child is changed in a morally significant way - I don't understand the question. ""Morals"" concern a person's behavior, not the person him or herself. I associate good morals with good behavior and a lack of bad behavior. I associate bad morals with bad behavior and the absence of good behavior. At birth, the baby lacks a moral sense; its behavior is amoral.

Things have value or moral worth. Some things have intrinsic value and others extrinsic. For example, I am sure you would agree that a born human being has value or moral worth. Assuming a born human being has intrinsic value, what is it about the intrinsic nature of the born human that gives it moral worth as opposed to a human being in utero?

&gt;EXACTLY. In one instance, the fetus's location relative to the woman does not change. The other marks the very first time that the fetus's location relative to the woman does change - in fact, the bodies separate. So to characterize birth as a mere ""change in location"" is at the very least, highly misleading. You simply gloss over everything that is significant about birth

Sorry but I don’t see how any of the things mentioned changes the intrinsic value of the living, human being.

The first thing you mentioned is physical separation. Well, conjoined twins come to mind. They are not physically separated but I doubt you’d say they have no value or personhood because of it.

The second thing you mention is interaction with the outside world. Notwithstanding the fact that a human fetus interacts with the outside world (just imagine a father feeling his child kick, he pushes the foot of the baby and the baby pushes back) I really do not see why this is necessary.

I associate good morals with good behavior and a lack of bad behavior.  I associate bad morals with bad behavior and the absence of good behavior.  At birth, the baby lacks a moral sense; its behavior is amoral.

&gt; In one instance he or she is in utero in a hallway. In the other he or she is probably on a hospital bed or in a doctors arms in a hospital.

EXACTLY.  In one instance, the fetus's location relative to the woman does not change.  The other marks the very first time that the fetus's location relative to the woman does change - in fact, the bodies separate.  So to characterize birth as a mere ""change in location"" is at the very least, highly misleading.  You simply gloss over [everything that is significant about birth](https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/4q11dv/two_reasons_why_you_can_think_abortion_is_immoral/d4xqybr/)",1,1489714475,2017-03-16 21:34:35

441,"I am not just referring to vital organs. I know of no legal distinction when it comes to other questions of bodily autonomy (no one is legally required to give blood, even though nearly everyone can do so safely). Besides, my uterus is pretty centrally located, and if I were to have a placental abruption and didn't receive immediate medical care including blood transfusions, I would likely die from hemorrhaging. That seems pretty vital to me. Nearly every pregnancy includes some form of complication, it's just that we obsessively provide pregnant women with monitoring and medical care so that they won't die. The fact that we are much more successful than we once were doesn't mean that pregnancy isn't risky. 

Btw, I'm glad your pregnancy was easy for you. I still have regular vomiting from morning sickness at 32 weeks (it peaked at 8x per day), and that isn't even considered a complication. I'm so lucky my health won't make me lose the job that supports my family. 

No, of course I wouldn't be okay with a parent just leaving a child to die. But that doesn't mean that I think that any time a child dies a parent should be criminalized for not putting his body on the line to preserve the child.

For instance, let's say a child goes into the road and if their parent throws himself in front of the car the child will be saved, otherwise, the child will die. 

I would probably throw myself in front of the car. I wouldn't be ""ok"" with the child's death. BUT I wouldn't want a parent to go to jail for failing to jump in front of the car. Moreover, I can imagine a parent having legitimate reasons for making the hard decision to not save the child, particularly if the parent has other children to think of and few supports. 

Women need to make decisions about the risks they are willing to undertake in the world as it is, not the world as it should be. Greater social supports would likely do much to lower the rate of women choosing abortion. But that doesn't mean that women should be criminalized or forced to follow through on the government's idea of what sorts of risks they should be willing to take with their bodies without concern for the woman's need to choose her own priorities in terms of which of her responsibilities to put her life on the line for.

447,"&gt;I bring up breastfeeding because it is the only way your scenario would require organ donation, which is an important factor for me. Organ donation is always a bodily autonomy issue, is always present in pregnancy, and is specifically legally designated as requiring separate consent and treated more seriously than other autonomy issues (such as freedom of movement). For instance, criminals can be imprisoned or even killed following due process (curtailing their bodily autonomy) but forced organ donation (or even blood donation), continues to be seen as a violation amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.

Not trying to be rude or anything but I don’t think you realize what organ means. Pretty much every part of your body is an organ. Maybe you are referring to vital organs?

&gt;My answer to your scenario is that it is within a person's rights to exercise his bodily autonomy. I didn't sidestep anything. But I did explain why such moral leniency may be required. Women don't get abortions for no reason at all; they have compelling motivating forces that drive them to get abortions. I have no idea what would potentially compel a person in your new scenario to leave their child (I would consider such a death to be a tragedy -one that I would do almost anything to avoid). But I would not want someone prosecuted for murder for such an action. In actual resource constrained environments including almost all of human history, the death of infants from malnutrition was not criminalized.

Again, malnutrition is not the same thing as starving a baby. I think if we are being intellectually honest we both know that. But am I correct in understanding that in the case of the parent, cabin and infant scenario you are fine with the baby being left out to die (the reasons should not matter if we want to be analogous to elective abortion on demand)?

&gt;But more pointedly, If you remove the organ donation, physical risk, and disruption to your ability to fulfill other aims and responsibilities, you are no longer talking about a suitable corollary to the experience of pregnancy/childbirth. Being pregnant doesn't mean that you suddenly have the full support of outsiders who will ensure that your live children are safe and well cared for and won't end up homeless or abused if you lose your job. 

There are more humane ways to deal with this problem. Social services, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, adoption, universal healthcare etc.

&gt;More than half of women who actually get abortions are already mothers, so I consider them to have many compelling motivators that they feed into their decision-making. Factors that often don't end up on a short list of exceptions. I am personally 7 months pregnant and the primary breadwinner for my family and your ""scenario"" sounds like a 7 month vacation to me. Where do I sign up? Who would want to leave that? Also, comparing the physical risk of pregnancy and childbirth to ""maybe getting the flu"" is not at all a reasonable comparison.

Perhaps it’s because you do not have born children yet :). I have two, trust me when I say your pregnancy (provided it is a normal and healthy one) will be a cake walk compared to raising the baby. My opinion anyway. But I do think this point is irrelevant. The question is whether or not you hold the concept of bodily autonomy consistently. And as far as I know, reasons for an action or inaction have no bearing on BA. It is simply about autonomy.
Either we can starve our children to death if we have no way of transferring responsibility in the moment or not (it shouldn't matter why because it's our body our choice right?)?

&gt;And I have no problem with engaging thought experiments. I do believe that there is some minimal level of responsibility that even strangers owe each other on a moral basis. (Although the bar for making something illegal is much higher). For instance, a person with an infant in a civilized setting who does not think he can care for the child needs to make his best effort at transferring care of that child to another (e.g., bringing it to a local hospital or fire dept). But this level of responsibility never includes even temporary organ donation, and never includes a level of life disruption or physical risk anywhere close to on par with pregnancy.

And this is where we disagree. Parental responsibility law forces a parent to meet the basic needs of their child. Even when it involves using your body and your organs to do this. But again, I think the misunderstanding is coming from the fact that you are probably only referring to vital organs. Am I correct? 

&gt;The reality is that women who are denied abortions suffer major disruptions to their capacity for self determination. Outcomes for such women and their families are measurably poorer. 

If this is true (source?) then I would again say that this can be changed via better social services, universal health care, paid pregnancy and maternity leave etc. This is the humane way to deal with this issue. Killing our offspring should not and need not be the solution.

&gt;Adding that to the forced organ donation element, it is not a small breech of bodily autonomy to insist that someone carry a child to term, but a gigantic one. 

But now it seems you are changing your argument to, we can restrict bodily autonomy in some cases but pregnancy is to big of a burden. Are you?

&gt;Given that all moral questions involve weighing one set of moral concerns against another (e.g. utilitarianism vs pragmatism) a suitable thought experiment related to abortion will correctly represent the impact to bodily autonomy. When you diminish that aspect, you are no longer using a suitable thought experiment.

Well first off, I don’t agree that my scenario diminishes the impact. In fact, I would find the parent in my scenario to be carrying a greater burden than a normal pregnancy. I’ve been pregnant and I’ve taken care of sick infants with the flu. I would choose the former or over the latter any day.

Second of all, the whole idea of bodily autonomy is that no one can force you to use your body in anyway. The idea that there is some threshold for when bodily autonomy becomes applicable undermines the whole concept. Don’t you see that? 

I’m sorry but I can’t help but think that you are doing everything to sidestep the actual point of reference.

I became pregnant and 18 and I had my daughter at 19, and she never stopped me from doing anything with my life.  In fact she motivated me.  I was the first of my friends to graduate with my Bachelor's Degree in Social Work and I went on to do Children's Protective Services and Adoptions for a number of years. 

I appreciate my life, I appreciate the lives of others, including the unborn.  I don't think it's any less wrong to kill a baby in the womb than it is to kill it once it's born. 

The research I have done says that they can save as many as 35% of ""wanted babies"" as early as 23 weeks, yet so many States allow elective abortions up until 24 weeks or later!  

I spent the better part of the morning arguing with a militant pro-choice woman who basically would not acknowledge that babies are even ""alive"" at 24 weeks.   I said, then what about all the babies that they are saving at 24 weeks???? They aren't ""alive""???  It's just illogical and unscientific thinking because they don't like the answers basic science gives them on this issue.  

Edit: I do judge women who have had them.  Most are just very selfish.  My former best friend had multiple abortions.  The last one she asked me for the money for it.  I begged her to keep that baby.  I told her I would help her in any way or even adopt it myself.  She still went a head and killed it.

I mean I would cringe when people I knew told me they had an abortion or abortions.  I was never very sympathetic.  None were ever raped.   None ever had medical issues.  They were just all pretty much done out of convenience and normally by women who weren't on any form of birth control and the guys didn't use condoms.   With so many effective options out there, what the left doesn't like to admit, is that abortions are needed most of the time because people of both sexes are just simply too lazy to use birth control.  Or they aren't using it consistently or properly. 

Why should they have to, when they know that they always have abortion as a ""back up"", if they should get pregnant?

Also, the pro-life movement has been taken over by the republicans. Many see it as pro-birth, not pro-life.

Again--I know this is traumatic for you, and I don't fault you for your decision. But I think the problem with treating your situation as a norm is that it could easily get out of hand. Some couples have been told to abort children for medical reasons only to find out that a test revealed a false positive, or that the diagnosis was more treatable/manageable than they thought.

54,We must remember that when comparing the crowd size that the March for Life happens EVERY year whilst the Women's March was once. Not only that but women's rights and a innocent baby's rights are not conflicting. So it is not even fair to compare the two because they don't conflict each other. At least not until Planned Parenthood and other groups stuck its nose in the Women's March. It is only because pro-choice organizations claim that you can't support both that we have this conflict. They are trying to hijack the women's movement and play it against us.,3,1485627138,2017-01-28 13:12:18

56,"There are a few things at play.

For one, it is viciously difficult to conceive of an ""other"" as made up of real, actual humans just like you.  Read [this article on ""the Monkeysphere""](http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html); it's on a comedy website now but predates that and is actually an excellent piece of writing.  That is a very large part of what's in play, on both sides.

Too, keep in mind that this is a group of people being fed generalities and regularly seeing the worst of the pro-life side.  Many of them believe the extreme is the whole and as these things go sometimes pro-choice leaders outright lie about things that we believe, but since they say many other true things, the false things are believable.  We're not immune from it either; for every pro-choice person who believes abortion is a necessary rite of passage there are twenty who believe it should be an absolute last resort and a hundred who believe it's acceptable when a woman is in a bad life position (fleeing an abusive relationship, say, or abandoned by her family and the child's father).  These moderate folks see their position as the reasonable one--don't we all?--and so opposing that is necessarily unreasonable.  

Look at it like this--you've got a woman whose boyfriend is beating her up several times a week, who sabotaged her birth control, and she just got the mental ability and the resources to leave him to be in the same place at the same time, so she's gone.  And then she finds out she's pregnant.  And having that baby might well tie her irretrievably to an abusive person, so the pro-choice folks think that *of course* the pregnancy should be ended.  We're sitting over here like ""Um, it's not the baby who is abusive,"" but the perception is we're thinking ""The abuse is probably her fault anyway!  Force her into a relationship with this terrible person!""  If you look at it from their wrong POV, we seem to be terrible people.

And there are statistics which, viewed on their own, make continuing a pregnancy appear a horrible, dangerous, deleterious thing.  Women who have children, on the whole, earn less money than women who do not, and have less education.  Being pregnant and giving birth is more dangerous than not, because the US has pretty high maternal mortality rates.  The children of single mothers have, on the whole, poorer outcomes.  So they want to throw abortion into this as a fix, even though it's about like thinking giving books to poor kids is magically going to make them perform better in school.  If you accept abortion as a social fix, then opposing it looks like you are trying to hold society back.",4,1485626526,2017-01-28 13:02:06
57,"I think in your case, a pregnancy where the baby had a severe defect and could not survive, that threatened your wife, most pro-lifers would be okay with abortion in that instance, or a lot of them would. Pro-lifers do tend to be divided on abortions done for ""euthanasia"" reasons (where the baby would die from a severe defect) but the majority are okay with abortion to save the mother's life. 

However I don't think that abortions in the ""hard"" cases justifies a law of abortion-on-demand. Abortions done for severe genetic defects, rape/incest, or the mother's life are a very small percentage of cases (I'd estimate about 3-4% based on state records that ask this question). So to me, I guess, it's not worth allowing the 96% of elective abortions for the very small percentage of nonelective abortion. ",1,1485626256,2017-01-28 12:57:36

62,"Let me tell you my story.

I got pregnant in 2014.  Went to the midwife, saw an awesome little baby on the screen (they do a quick scan in the office with a portable machine), everything looked good.  Came back two weeks later for the anatomy scan.

The tech took one picture.  Then started pushing down really hard, and quit talking.  Then went and got another tech to repeat the scan and started talking to *her*.  I heard things like ""missing leg"" and ""amniotic rupture"" and ""no diaphragm.""  The exam was over pretty quickly after that and I went back to the office in tears, clutching the only picture of my baby she'd taken.  I talked with the midwife.  I said ""This is incompatible with life, isn't it?""  She agreed.  

They got me in the next day with an MFM specialist.  All the stuff I was told before was confirmed, and more.  She had virtually no abdominal wall, all of her organs (including the bottom of her heart) were on the outside, she had a club foot and a 90 degree curve in her spine.  Mind you, I'm saying ""her"" through all of this because I was given a blood test later on, but she was so deformed she didn't have discernable genitals.  I was given a diagnosis of limb body wall complex and twice offered a termination.

In the end, I carried her another 18 weeks.  I forever altered the course of my birthing life by having my third c-section (up until then I'd been successfully having VBA2Cs).  And then I held my daughter on my chest her whole life.  I cried and kissed her and told her I loved her and I was sorry I couldn't fix her.  She kicked me in the face and tried to cry, but she could not.

While I was pregnant, I became involved in a support group for other women who'd chosen to continue LBWC pregnancies.  And one of the things I learned was that *doctors lie.*  Again and again women came, scared, to the group and related horrible, untrue things they were told by their doctors.  That their baby would die horribly.  That they were endangered by continuing their pregnancies.  That their babies were as good as dead anyway, so they might as well terminate.  There was one woman who was told at literally *every single appointment* that she should abort her loved and longed-for child.

Now, most of us with LBWC babies just do palliative care.  A few have had more aggressive care.  Oxygen, etc.  One woman was blessed enough to have her baby live for three days and they thought he might make it.  Those babies had a commonality: they were all given pain medication when they began to fail.  One mom had to fight for it (she'd had to fight to be cared for when she chose not to abort, and she'd had to fight to get them to agree to even check her daughter once born), the other did not.  There is no need to leave a neonate in pain.

There's a link for perinatal hospice over in the sidebar.  One of the things about it is this: when perinatal hospice is offered, the percentage of pregnancies continued rises from 20% to anywhere from 40% to 75%. And a *lot* of those people are told (wrongly) that their babies will suffer if they don't abort.  The founder of the movement in the US wrote a book called *A Gift of Time* which in part catalogs the pressure to abort and the things people are told to get them to comply.  

I could almost bet if you googled your child's particular disorder, you could find someone who happily continued their pregnancy.  A quick search of osteogenesis imperfecta type two brings up [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkrXximFShk), of the Kellers and their son James.  They seem to have been told pretty much what you were, and continued their pregnancy anyway, and were given 30 hours with their son.  And they don't regret it.

So...it's not an easy answer.  And there is not going to be a homogeneous answer in this sub.  For me, I see the value in any life, no matter how short, and believe doctors should not shade their pronouncements to patients to get them to comply (which they do, in matters big and small; I had a doctor who wanted me to have a c-section lie to me about the risk of uterine rupture, claiming it was ""at least"" double what it was), and frankly I view that as the biggest problem here.",5,1485624754,2017-01-28 12:32:34

As far as calling it euthanasia, that is definitely how it felt, and how we treated it, so I can get down with that argument. I guess my problem is that if the push is to ban abortion altogether, this makes it impossible to even have that conversation for people who are in our position. It's that reason that I cannot support making abortion illegal. 

That being said, it seems that most people commenting here are kinda on the same page, wanting abortion to be illegal for people using it to fix irresponsible behavior, but keeping it legal when it is a medical issue. 

Where do you stand on that? Do you think that it should just be illegal altogether, even in cases like this where it is a euthanasia question or in times where the mothers life is in danger?

The restriction will not apply in cases of rape or incest or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed.""

That was the language of the bill last time. Not sure where you are seeing ""shut it down"". Defunding something doesn't mean taking legal action, it just means we stop supplying them with money. Planned Parenthood is not what it seems on the surface. They have been involved in sketchy things in the past, and the ""3% of what we do is abortions"" number is only that small because of the fact that they count everything as a ""service"", including simply giving a condom to someone.

While a lot of pro-lifers think that life starts at conception, most are willing to include a very small amount of scenarios in which abortion would be legal. The movement hasn't been fully centered around ending the entire practice of abortion, it's been focused around keeping government money from funding abortions and to make current abortion laws stricter.

There is no reason for the child to be in pain. The hospital can administer pain medicine to a patient and probably would in this instance. They do this all the time at ""end of life"" type care.

Honestly, when subjects are this divisive, I think people need to remember that the other side probably has a good point somewhere, and we need to start there and work to understand the other side. For example, most people on both sides agree that abortion should not be used as a contraceptive to fix irresponsibility. They disagree when things get stickier. Working to understand and come together is how we can move forward, not throwing hate at each other.

126,"Hey. Thanks for sharing all this with us. I just want to extend to you a big welcome -- to the pro-life movement. We don't all agree on everything, but just know you have friends here. 

I really....really understand your struggle. I have been very strongly pro-life for a long time. I am also an atheist, a feminist, left-leaning on lots of issues, and I'm in graduate school. People are *not* friendly to pro-lifers at this level of education. As such, it can be very isolating. I often keep it to myself. I am a strong introvert so it doesn't bother me a lot. But I have some friends with whom I've never shared my pro-life beliefs with, and it does feel dishonest at times.  

But I think ultimately you have to care about your own mental health and well-being along with the pro-life mission. You can't just sacrifice yourself at all costs. Don't feel bad that you want to keep some friends around. Know that if you are close enough with someone, and they care about and trust you, your perspectives on all issues will be *welcomed* and not automatically derided. That is my hope when becoming close with people, that eventually they will get to a stage where they trust and respect me enough to *listen* to an opposing view on abortion and perhaps think twice about their own view. Otherwise, what's the point in sharing it? 

When people ask you directly about your position on this, they should be prepared to hear some opposing views. You are clearly a respectful person, not wishing to push the issue or argue unnecessarily. I don't know your friend but I bet this kind of behavior is going to make them far more open to discussing it again in the future. ",1,1485579605,2017-01-28 00:00:05

The case for preserving life is already there innate within us.  We seek justice.  Whether it is placed there by God is an argument for another day. A strong sense of justice resides in our human psyche. It is first among the human sensibilities.  Abortion in America is unjust. It is one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice in our history.   It must be argued from this and from a scientific platform first.  These weapons we already have in abundance. We have it through a historical record from the evidence of men enslaving and detaining others men by degrading their humanity.  We have the science of DNA and the ability to keep premature babies alive earlier in their gestation. We have what we need to fight this,  all we lack here to fore is the will to fight.

&gt;*The truth is: I believe, in all my heart, that future generations will look back at this era in American history and condemn us. They’ll look at what’s happened here since 1973, and they will characterize this nation as barbarians. At some point—hopefully in our lifetime, but certainly at some point—people will look back at this practice and say, “How could that be possible?”*

&gt;*In the way that we look back at the atrocities of the past—at things that occurred 100, 200, 300 years ago—at institutions that we as a nation banned and look at, and say, “How could people have supported this stuff? How could people have turned a blind eye to these things? How could people have ignored that these things were happening?”*

&gt;*The way we look at those things in history and condemn them?: This era will be condemned for this, I have no doubt about it. Our job is to accelerate the process of getting there.

That the right to life is a fundamental one that trumps virtually any other right I can imagine.*

Wade the number of abortions that were repeats (done on a woman who had at least one previously) went from 15% in 1974 to 47% in 1993. Some pro-choice groups estimate one million illegal abortions before Roe but there's no basis to those numbers. Two liberal economists used CDC and Guttmacher data to [estimate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/outofwedlock.pdf) 88,000 abortions per year to unmarried women per year in the late 60s. Obviously this isn't all of the illegal abortions (since it doesn't include married women) but in 1970 a third of women receiving legal abortions were married, so I'd guess the number of illegal abortions were probably around 150,000 per year, probably not higher than 200,000. So the abortion rate (using population estimates for the time) would have been about 3.8 per 1,000, far lower than the current rate (14.6). So while some illegal abortions would still happen abortion would probably be much less common if it were illegal. ",3,1485491105,2017-01-26 23:25:05

240,"&gt; 1) are most people completely against abortion or just against it after x weeks?

Completely. Biologically, an individual human life comes into existence after the sperm fertilizes the egg. We don't believe that there are any other requirements (like a certain level of development or awareness) for being a human being who has the right to not be murdered.

&gt; 2) My only concern with wanting abortion is if a couple IS ON birth control, and still end up getting pregnant.

In this case, the couple's desire to not be pregnant would not justify killing their child.

&gt; 3) Is the general pro-life thought that there shouldn't be birth control either 

Not inherently. The belief that unborn children have the right to live doesn't logically necessitate that all contraception is wrong. However, there are a few reasons why pro-life people might be against contraception: 

- Some methods like IUDs or hormonal methods work primarily by preventing conception (preventing ovulation or harming sperm) but secondarily by preventing implantation. That is, after conception has already occurred, they kill the living embryo. 

- Some pro-life people, for example Catholics, are against all types of contraception, even those that don't kill, like condoms. But this isn't a result of pro-life belief, it's more of coincidence. 

&gt; and that sex should only be done to have a child?

No, but whoever has sex should be responsible for the possibility of conceiving a child, because that is after all the natural purpose of sex. ",7,1485478188,2017-01-26 19:49:48

That's what I hate about the pro-choice arguments. They demand women keep the choice to opt-out of parenthood after conception but profit from and sometimes exploit men having no choice and being forced to become parents with no such opt-out.

They wanted me to sign a petition to pledge my support for abortion services being covered by healthcare. One young woman spoke candidly about how being able to end her pregnancy by abortion was an important factor in allowing her to continue schooling.

I smiled at her and said that I was sorry I hadn't met her sooner. I told her I would have adopted that baby and loved him or her because my husband and I have been unable to conceive. I told her that I didn't judge her or think she was a monster. I told her I'd pray for her and her baby and that our parish akways had room for one more person if she ever felt moved to come. I told her I was returning to college to get my degree because I was unable to stay home and raise a family.

The other women at the table were a little derisive and scornful. But the young lady who so candidly shared her abortion experience got up and gave me a hug. We were opposites, and I don't know if she changed her mind that day. I hope she did.

Asia alone encompasses 60% of the world population. Africa has the second largest population at 17%. And Latin America 5%. I imagine if we step out of the ethnocentricity that American's often encompass it would be safe to say that most of the rest of the world is actually prolife.  

On that note, most of Europe actually restricts abortion after 12 weeks (with the exception for the life of the mother) and developed prolife nations actually tend to have the lowest abortion rates and plus benefit form higher maternal health.

Some gems:

&gt;The idea would have been unthinkable before the advent of a technology developed in 1976: real-time ultrasound. At six weeks, the “heartbeat” is not audible; it is visible, a flickering that takes place between 120 and 160 times per minute on a black-and-white playback screen. As cardiac cells develop, they begin to send electrical pulses that cause their neighbors to contract. Scientists can observe the same effect if they culture cells in a petri dish.

Because a cell culture of another species in a petri dish and a human embryo are apparently the same.

&gt;The origins of fetal ultrasound lie in stealth warfare. Ultrasound technology was first developed to scan vast spaces, rather than telescope in on infinitesimal cell masses.

Well, guess we'd better stop using microwaves for purposes other than watching TV.

&gt;These images produced a new and unprecedented vision of human development. Before ultrasound, medical care received by pregnant women had depended on their testimony, or how they described their own sensations. Ultrasound made it possible for the male doctor to evaluate the fetus without female interference. 

Because apparently medicine should be based upon the patient's feelings rather than an expert looking at facts.",5,1485388089,2017-01-25 18:48:09

At most places that aren't PP or FQHCs, women would have to pay a copay and pay for the appointment required to get a prescription, even if the monthly fees for birth control have been eliminated (thanks to ACA).

372,"&gt;I'm not sure what you mean, condoms are free at planned parenthood, they are not free at Walmart, Target, and convenience stores.

True but they often cost less than a dollar per condom. 

&gt;And many women who live paycheck to paycheck may not feel it is an expense that they can afford.

This is a minority of women though. In AGI's survey of women who had abortions only 8% of women who didn't use birth control said they had a problem affording it (so the total would be about 4% including the women who were using birth control). And this was in 2000. The CDC's survey of women who had unintended pregnancies didn't even mention lack of affordability as a significant factor. 

&gt;Medicaid reimbursements from the government are what fund that.

Birth control has been fully subsidized for Medicaid patients everywhere, not just at PP. They can get birth control at FQHCs as well. 

&gt;Many women may have never learned how to properly use a condom (since this is not allowed to be taught in many schools) or have learned about what other birth control options are available if they don't like the pill.

I doubt this is the majority of women who get abortions though. A slight majority of women who get abortions are 25 or older. Condoms come with instructions. Women 30 and older are more likely to get abortions than teens. Almost half of abortions are performed on women who already had one (20% of them had at least two) and nearly all abortion clinics (about 96%) offer birth control counseling. So I really don't think most women getting abortions don't know how to use condoms or aren't familiar with other birth control methods. ",5,1485381833,2017-01-25 17:03:53

Maybe there would be more organizations to help poor immigrants (organizations that don't routinely kill inconvenient people) if we gave money to reputable organizations instead of the mob. Maybe they're already there and ready to step in. Why not fund similar programs (minus the murder) through local banks and credit unions? 

Similarly, why not fund these exact same women's services through the reputable general practitioner doctors that already exist and provide the exact same services? If the issue is cost, surely we can come up with a way to offset the costs through general practitioners that is at least as effective as paying for completely separate buildings, supplies, facilities, and doctors, while avoiding funding a highly controversial, highly political, lobbyist organization that provides more abortions than any other in the nation.

I believe this article sums up pretty well why sentience and self-awareness are not great qualifiers for person-hood. I will sum up as well as I can.

Essentially, WE do not lose our person-hood when we lose the ability to be self aware and have desires, as long as we have the capacity to regain these functions (such as when we sleep). Imagine an adult friend goes into a coma, awakens, and exists in an infant-like mental capacity.  Did he lose his status as a person? Do we have the right to end his life even as he might regain these functions? If your answer is no, then you have to ask yourself is it because he first exhibited these functions, or is it because he has the intrinsic ability to gain these functions? The former is Ad hoc, leaving only the latter.  Which means that a developing human, at any stage of life, has inherent human value.

Similarly, the ""pain"" argument is also an ad hoc argument.  Are people born with congenital analgesia not considered human beings with rights?  Is any person with a disability that interferes with normal body functions less ""human"" than we are, and therefore subject to the loss of a right to live?  Now consider the above examples are of permanent conditions, what if someone existed with such a condition with which they would eventually develop out of, such as a fetus experiencing pain. If an adult with these conditions is considered a person, then there is no reason a fetus should not be either.

453,"&gt;Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.

&gt;In Practical Ethics, Singer argues in favour of abortion rights on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.

Found this on Wikipedia. Seems a little bit cold, but I agree. But his views on newborns seem very extreme. It goes against what he states in the previous paragraph. A newborn can feel pain and pleasure, thus it should be able to hold preferences. 

&gt;Similar to his argument for abortion, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—""rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness""—and therefore ""killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.""",7,1485301830,2017-01-24 18:50:30

&gt;Fetal brain activity starts very, very early

Yes certain kinds of brain activity start, but are not much more than what reflexes are. These are not controlled. 

Here more about this:

&gt;By week 13 the fetus has begun to move. Around this time the corpus callosum, the massive collection of fibers (the axons of neurons) that allow for communication between the hemispheres, begins to develop, forming the infrastructure for the major part of the cross talk between the two sides of the brain. Yet the fetus is not a sentient, self-aware organism at this point; it is more like a sea slug, a writhing, reflex-bound hunk of sensory-motor processes that does not respond to anything in a directed, purposeful way.

&gt;Synapses-the points where two neurons, the basic building blocks of the nervous system, come together to interact-form in large numbers during the seventeenth and following weeks, allowing for communication between individual neurons. Synaptic activity underlies all brain functions. Synaptic growth does not skyrocket until around postconception day 200 (week 28). Nonetheless, at around week 23 the fetus can survive outside the womb, with medical support; also around this time the fetus can respond to aversive stimuli.  

[Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/books/chapters/the-ethical-brain.html)

To me this is the point where a foetus becomes a person.

We simply have a different definition of when a person starts to be a living being. To me, a bundle of cells, regardless of how it looks, is not a baby or a person until it shows proper brain activity (pain, reflexes, coherent activity). Maybe I'll even go as far as to say that the baby isn't really alive until it can survive outside the mother's womb (with help). 

So:

&gt;I am 100% for personal freedom, as long as it only impacts that one person.

In my view early abortion only impacts one person directly, and that's the pregnant women, to a lesser degree the man who impregnated her. Thus abortion should be absolutely legal and should be able to be preformed in a safe environment. 

Banning it or heavily limiting it will only lead to more deaths.

468,"This is a good question. I hate that you've been downvoted so much.

This is a point I've been bringing up for years. Abortion doesn't fix problems. It treats symptoms of problems, and it does so at the cost of the lives of literally the most innocent among us. The actual problem is the lax and flippant attitude people have come to have about sex. When you remove all consequences to your actions, then all of a sudden you have a bunch of people who don't know what to do when those consequences catch up to them. Women are still getting laid then left, for example, and that's a culture problem. The baby resulting from this isn't the issue. It is a consequence that in and of itself will increase responsibility among most people. 


Actual ideas for mitigation of consequences:  
Men are already required to pay life support for their children so it doesn't get totally dumped on the mother. I think that this should be better enforced. Also, I think that adoption should be easier on both parties than it is now.  Obviously there need to be regulations to avoid nasty people getting their hands on children, but there are a TON of monetary restrictions on adopting that are just plain bullcrap. To reduce young pregnancies, major public highschool reform needs to happen; these kids need to be taught *self-control* as a life skill. These are the issues that the government can help with.

HOWEVER: these will not fix the problem on their own. Like it or not, the problems surrounding abortion are inarguably cultural problems, and government actions will not fix them. They demand a cultural solution. Hollywood needs to clean up its act. Advertising companies need reform. Most of all, PARENTS NEED TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN about responsibility, love, selflessness, etc. Nothing the government does will effect these things. It absolutely CAN, however, stop making the problems worse by failing to outlaw murder in the name of convenience.

In this case, it should be.

In the case of organ donation, you are not killing someone by not donating organs. Through abortion, you are directly killing a human being.

There are also many times where we prioritize other rights over the right of bodily autonomy. For example, when someone is arrested, their bodily autonomy is subverted by the right to safety (an extension of the right to live) of others. For another example, one's bodily autonomy to put whatever they want in their body is restricted with prescription drugs like thalidomide, because they cause harm to unborn children. My point in mentioning that is that bodily autonomy is not an absolute right, and it should not take precedence over the right to life (ordinarily). ",1,1485294492,2017-01-24 16:48:12

From my view as a Prochoicer? I honestly see some loaded language here. ""Let's not kill babies"". Well, a lot of us don't see a fetus the same way we see an already-born, fully formed baby. It already feels like you're misrepresenting us because when we see ""baby killer"", we think of bad parents who poison their 8 month old or throw them in the dumpster or whatever, not a medical procedure (our opinion). Not excusing the shit that was flung at you, however, but it does put a lot of us on the defensive.

Even if you think our reasoning for being PChoice is bullshit, can you at least see what I'm saying? I get you feel like we're baby killers, but if you seriously want to engage in a discussion, please keep in mind that a lot of us don't even like abortion and don't want to see children die, so saying we're baby killers explicitly or implicitly makes us not want to listen to your side.

73,"&gt;I'm not saying that makes it right, I'm saying there's never been an unchangeable connection between sex and pregnancy. Right or wrong, it's always existed. Sex has never meant obligatory pregnancies.

Listen, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here that you are not trolling. I will explain as best I can. Prolifers believe that all living and innocent human beings have a right to life. If you had consensual sex and end up with a human being in your uterus you can not kill them to get them out of there. Many prolifers believe that even if the sex is consensual the right to life is so integral that you still can not kill to get them out.

If you personally do not believe that parents are morally and/or legally obligated to care for their children that is your personal opinion but current laws expect otherwise.

If you truly believe that a parent can kill their child or leave them to die then would you agree that if a woman gives birth and she and the father of the child leave the kid in a dumpster to die, neither parent should be criminally charged? Under current law they would be charged with negligence at best, murder at worst.

&gt;the bible clearly states we can not kill human beings.
Not so clear. It says don't murder in some places, don't kill in other. Yet Christians have always been willing to kill in the name of God or war or whatever. Innocent bystanders. So that suggests this is not clear. Some killing is ok, even to people following the bible. You haven't explained why abortion falls outside of the ""ok"" category. Because they're innocent? So are the civilians killed in war (or the muslims killed in the crusades).

Perhaps there are many killings in war that are unjust and therefore murder. That being said, innocent people are sometimes killed in an attempt to self defend oneself. In the same way, abortion to save the life of the mother is acceptable (at least imo).
  
&gt;Your link is summarizing... I'd like to see the actual laws please.

The link summarizes the law.

&gt;Because what if a parent can't provide those things? Surely the laws address that, and that is the case in abortion.

Which case of abortion falls under that?

&gt;Isn't the pregnant mother indisputably part of the household?

Yup
 
What about her needs? 

You will have to do your best to provide for everyone's needs.

&gt;What is ""his own""? Does that mean his fellow citizens? Everyone in the world (like the way that ""neighbor"" doesn't actually mean person who lives next to you in love your neighbor as yourself)?

Pretty sure it means biologically related. As in family(including adoption).

&gt;In that case, couldn't you argue that not providing abortions for women who need it is a sin? 

No because abortion is not a need.

&gt;What is your exact interpretation of this verse and why is it one that I should believe means what you say it does?

It, along with the other passages (again context) shows that a pre born was referenced in the same way as born child.

I don't know about Jewish belief but, we are talking about Christianity here so I'm not sure how that's relevant.

&gt;How does this have anything to do with abortion? Doesn't God knit together everything? Including fetuses that will be aborted?

104,"&gt; Not really. Women have been having abortions forever (legal or illegal, it's an option women have been taking). And, perhaps for those women, that's the most responsible decision they can make. Also, where in the bible does it say that if you conceive a child you have to finish gestating it? Where does it say that if you don't want the baby you have to keep it because sex = parenthood? I think these arguments are all made outside of any biblical justification.

Just because something has been happening forever does not make it right. Rape, murder, child abuse have all been happening forever but I doubt you'd argue that this makes these things ok.

As I noted, the bible clearly states we can not kill human beings. Abortion kills an innocent and living human being and is therefore wrong. If you can not follow that train of logic I am not sure you are really willing to have an open discussion.

I'm sure in the future when artificial wombs are available this will be a viable option for Christians.

&gt; Are you saying that the physical toll of preparing a bottle is equivalent to pregnancy? 

No. Not really what I said at all. I am saying that a parent is legally and morally compelled to provide for the ordinary needs of their children. The degrees and body parts which must be used to do so are irrelevant.

&gt;Is a mother required to be the one to prepare the bottle and no one else can do it? 

It depends on the situation. Generally no but I am sure we can imagine a situation where this is the only option.

&gt;As far as parental responsibility laws, they have nothing to do with abortion as far as I can tell. They deal with when a parent has to report abuse by the other parent.

Again, all of us our doomed in the same way. It is our lot to eventually die. If this can mean our lives have value then I don't see why it wouldn't apply to an unborn baby as well. 

&gt; Well really you could argue that all abortions are to save the life or well being of the mother. No woman comes through pregnancy unscathed. Until the baby is here you don't know what you're risking to have it. Lots of life threatening situations arise later in pregnancy.

You could argue that all abortions are to save the life of the mother but it would be a bad argument. Even [data](https://www.guttmacher.org/about/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives) by pro-choice groups like the Guttmacher Institute say that health reasons are not anywhere close to being the only reason women seek abortion.

&gt; I'm not saying there's no responsibility, I'm saying that calling children a gift doesn't make a responsibility. It's why puppies make bad gifts- unwanted responsibilities are not good gifts! And if someone brought a puppy to my house I would say no thanks and not accept the gift.

You're example is a poor illustration of what an abortion is. Babies don't just appear randomly like a stranger showing up at you're door with unwanted puppies. They exist (in the vast majority of cases) as a direct result of a consensual act between two adults, the father and mother. A more accurate example would be if you brought the puppies home, decided you didn't want them anymore, and ended their lives. This would be condemned as an act of animal cruelty, not a celebration of individual freedom.

I'm using the car accident example to show what an abortion is. If your actions directly put another human being in a position where their survival depends on your help, then you have a responsibility to help. Are you saying that if you were hit by a car, you would be okay if the stranger drove off? What if you were a fetus in a womb thrust into existence through no fault of your own?

&gt; Sure but an aborted fetus doesn't do anything else.

This seems like a very arbitrary line for assigning value. You need to explain what you mean a little more.

&gt; I am never legally obligated to let someone inside my body when I don't want them there. Even if it's to protect and care for them.

But a pregnancy isn't just letting a stranger in your body! You (since you're using yourself as an example) are the reason why they're in there in the first place. I suspect this is probably going to be the area we disagree the most.

Not really.  Women have been having abortions forever (legal or illegal, it's an option women have been taking).  And, perhaps for those women, that's the most responsible decision they can make.  Also, where in the bible does it say that if you conceive a child you have to finish gestating it?  Where does it say that if you don't want the baby you have to keep it because sex = parenthood?  I think these arguments are all made outside of any biblical justification.

&gt;Preparing a bottle involves the use of your organs. 

Are you saying that the physical toll of preparing a bottle is equivalent to pregnancy?  Is a mother required to be the one to prepare the bottle and no one else can do it?  As far as parental responsibility laws, they have nothing to do with abortion as far as I can tell.  They deal with when a parent has to report abuse by the other parent.

&gt;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

Because the belief that humans are made in the image of God is a central tenet of Christian belief and this belief probably influenced the early Christians' condemnation of abortion and infanticide (both of which were common and accepted in ancient Rome). 

&gt;All abortions are safer than pregnancy. A fetus threatens its mother's well being.

This is going off topic for your original question but at least 98% of abortions are performed for elective reasons. Very very few are done for cases of maternal health. ",2,1480036483,2016-11-24 20:14:43

If you didn't want a human inside you, then you should have avoided having sex.

137,"&gt; Is all killing murder?

It is, when the victim is an innocent human being. 

&gt; As far as John the Baptist, what makes you think he's not a special case?

Because of all the other references to unborn children interacting with God, which other people have already listed. 

&gt;  If all babies were filled with the holy spirit, wouldn't it be unremarkable that he is?

No.

&gt; Is self defense justified?

Perhaps, perhaps not. As a Christian I am called to turn the other cheek. Even if I were a slave to a master or a government that threatens my life, I must submit unless I am asked to break God's law. Christ and all the saints and martyrs of the early church did not lift a hand against their enemies. 

&gt;  Why would he make a fetus he KNEW would be aborted?

Again, this argument doesn't work because God makes everyone, including all murder victims. Why God allows evil to happen is a question that many Biblical characters struggle with, such as Job and the Psalmist. We don't know the answer, but we know that it doesn't mean that God condones evil. ",3,1480023742,2016-11-24 16:42:22

Every action has consequences and responsibilities attached to them. Consensual sex that results in creating a new human being has parental responsibility attached to it.  

&gt; To use their organs to keep their kids alive? 

Yes. You are obliged to provide for the ordinary needs of your children. Preparing a bottle involves the use of your organs. Pretty much every part of a human beings' body is considered an organ. Look up parental responsibility laws.

Also, what bible verse is this?

Then he should know a fetus is doomed to be aborted even before it's conceived.  Why not just avoid letting it be conceived?

&gt; Aside from abortions done to save the life of the mother, which is a very small percentage of abortions, most would not fit in this category.

Well really you could argue that all abortions are to save the life or well being of the mother.  No woman comes through pregnancy unscathed.  Until the baby is here you don't know what you're risking to have it.  Lots of life threatening situations arise later in pregnancy.

&gt; Saying that there is no responsibility here is like saying a driver isn't responsible for injuring somebody in a car accident. Would you feel that way if you were hit by a car? 

I'm not saying there's no responsibility, I'm saying that calling children a gift doesn't make a responsibility.  It's why puppies make bad gifts- unwanted responsibilities are not good gifts!  And if someone brought a puppy to my house I would say no thanks and not accept the gift.

The origin of one's moral principle of opposition to unjust killing is not significant to the pro-life cause; what matters is having a moral code that condemns unjust killing (and virtually all humans do). What the Bible says on abortion is immaterial, since it already condemns unjust killing of other humans, which, in light of what we know about genetics and fetal development, is enough to support a prohibition on abortion.

244,"The big verse I always hear is Jeremiah 1:5:
""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations""
This isn't a verse meant to specifically address the issue of abortion so it is out of context. However, I think the verse does show that God values our lives before we are born and even before we are conceived.

Let me offer some friendly push back on a few of your comments on the verses you listed because, to be frank, they're poor objections to a pro-life world view.

&gt; Ex 20:13 Thou shalt not murder (but not all killing is murder... what makes abortion murder?)

Because abortion is killing an innocent human life? Circumstances where killing is justified normally involve self-defense or defending a love one. Aside from abortions done to save the life of the mother, which is a very small percentage of abortions, most would not fit in this category.

&gt; Ps 127:3 Children are a gift from the Lord (but you aren't obligated to accept a gift...)

Even if you are partly responsible for creating the gift? Of course we are not obligated to have kids! However, babies don't just pop up into existence for no reason. Normally they exist as a consequence to two people having sex right? Saying that there is no responsibility here is like saying a driver isn't responsible for injuring somebody in a car accident. Would you feel that way if you were hit by a car? What if you were thrust into existence by the actions of others and they were seeking to end your existence?

&gt; Psalm 139 You knit me together in my mother's womb (Wouldn't this suggest God is ok with abortion? He makes fetuses knowing they'll be aborted, right?)

All of us die. Period. This doesn't make murdering a person okay even though God knows we will die eventually. That fetuses are born which get aborted is no different from the lot all of us face. Regardless of the outcome, God created human life with value and expects us to love and care for one another. Abortion is the murder of an unborn child that has never committed wrong against another human being. Under any moral framework, religious or not, why don't we have a duty to protect and care for the most vulnerable and helpless of us?",12,1479880949,2016-11-23 01:02:29

A distinct and living, human organism begins to exist at the moment of fertilization. Biological fact.

""Development of the embryo begins at Stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote.""
[England, Marjorie A. Life Before Birth. 2nd ed. England: Mosby-Wolfe, 1996, p.31]

""Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""
[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2]

""Embryo: the developing organism from the time of fertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism becomes known as a fetus.""

""Embryo: The early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. In man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
[Walters, William and Singer, Peter (eds.). Test-Tube Babies. Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 160]

""The development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[Langman, Jan. Medical Embryology. 3rd edition. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1975, p. 3]

""Embryo: The developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... At the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... The term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[Considine, Douglas (ed.). Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia. 5th edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1976, p. 943]

""I would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""
[Dr. John Eppig, Senior Staff Scientist, Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and Member of the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel -- Panel Transcript, February 2, 1994, p. 31]

""The development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[Sadler, T.W. Langman's Medical Embryology. 7th edition. Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins 1995, p. 3]

""The question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. I think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum....

""Zygote. This cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (Gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. The common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""

""The chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. These pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2N nucleus of the fertilized zygote. This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
[Larsen, William J. Human Embryology. 2nd edition. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1997, p. 17]

""Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... The combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. Thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. The embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[O'Rahilly, Ronan and M�ller, Fabiola. Human Embryology &amp; Teratology. 2nd edition. New York: Wiley-Liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. This textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]

""[A]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""[A] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. In its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""I'll let you in on a secret. The term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by IVF practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. The new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""The term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by IVF patients. 'Don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. They won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

The second is something along the view that what makes killing wrong is the loss of the victim’s or human being’s potential future and thus, abortion is wrong.

The point where the egg and sperm unite to form a unique embryo is the point where there is a shift from potential--an egg or sperm that could combine with any one of millions of others, or could simply pass through the reproductive system and die--to a complete and original human genome in an embryo that will rapidly begin to grow and develop, continuing this growth and development until adulthood under normal circumstances.

Think about it this way: a sperm or an egg requires an action and an ""other half"" to develop into an adult person. An embryo is already growing--into adulthood, unless something kills it.

Any other point where we define the beginning of ""human life"" seems arbitrary.

So no matter what a Pro Life advocate does, they are offering up the option of abortion, but the same could be said if any CPC referred a patient to a doctor or licensed medical practitioner.  

The objectionable thing here is the hostage taking.  Civil disobedience here essentially entails falsely representing oneself as a licensed medical practitioner and abusing that position of authority and trust to *prevent* patients from receiving free licensed medical care.  There are real health consequences to this.  Women with real wanted pregnancies have had preventable miscarriages and expensive hospital stays because CPCs lied to them about the health of their baby.  One day someone will sue.  Unfortunately many of these women are so devastated (and have so few means) that they prefer to just move on rather than endure a decade long lawsuit.
