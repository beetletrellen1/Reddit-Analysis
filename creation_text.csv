8125,well originally saying someone believed infant unaffected fall believe may said could possible defense non literal fall necessity would believe infants equal moral character god would morally perfect different age accountability belief people hold belief would admit infant still sinful creature young understand inherent sin nature need christ held accountable god

people converted christianity lived outside former borders roman empire without less subjugation slavic people ways germanic people others less converted crusades example balkan people converted afaik crusades also african people well people south north america converted colonialism thus subjugation though defence christianity europe border much regions people islam naturally less chances convert others say anything truth religion telling often common theme islam spread war terror speak subjugation though true islam around mediterranean spread less war terror speak subjugation also regions converted islam peacefully contact least layman general history knowledge far frequent christianity case muslim find unfair people believe islam mostly spread subjugation christianity gt know single word arabic know muslim critic david wood criticized quran saying full broken arabic makes difficult interpret looked https www youtube com watch v rigmarkrndw video first personally like tone antogonizing tone many one sided news speaker also prone use strawman arguments experience secondly claims better said quotes gerd puin claims qur incomprehensible even though muslims claim otherwise know q arabic never read quran statement makes question claim basically saying even though muslim arab muslims suppose porblems understanding interpreting claims qur mostly incomprehensible questionable imo similar claiming bible contains many evil immoral things though christians claim otherwise claims muslims rather quran translated already broken q arabic intranslatable reason heard muslim friends internet always prefer original quran muslims want preserve word god well possible though impression original q arabic highly adviced required translating language language loses always information different cultures language speakers drastic lost reasons top head one reason quran considered poetry written meter https en wikipedia org wiki metre poetry simimal ancient greeks romans usual dilemma translating poetry whether meaning feel prioritized going meaning quran feel marginized issue word polysemy ambiguity word several less related concept almost words aculture specific even though one could say one one translation certain words always slight nuances lack better example let take word balls english one meaning spheres another testicles joke ambiguity like kicked balls two possible ways interpreting however translating german would problem polysemy german translated sie hat meine b lle getretten normally german would even think testicles convey meaning one would say sie hat meine eier getreten would literally kicked eggs hand english speaker would normally think testicles think though rather immature example shows translation loose information example lost ambiguity course think something like testicle joke appear quran think imagine scenario happening word x used metaphor concept something however translating nuances get mixed think one compare well rap translate good rap looses effect meaning raps generally culture specific also good example german words gem tlichkeit often said translatable one word honest would translate cosiness maybe misapply meaning argument sake let say whole meaning translatable one word even though german english culture relatively close cultural words translate well english imagine translating quran influenced much different culture english one occurance words gem tlichkeit much higher english german may much bigger differences significance also significant translation error found way common
