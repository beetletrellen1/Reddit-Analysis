therefore many many orders magnitude difference rates see evolution producing new information present vs claimed done past gt grant comparison imperfect think difference great enough deserves serious attention amp nbsp response short version https www youtube com watch v g bftq xxfc long version main problems line reasoning bunch smaller issues fry big fish amp nbsp problem first inability quantify functional information functional nucleotides sorry much mammalian genome functional really know approximate lower upper limits human genome give take say every mammalian genome sequenced even even whole lot johnberea creationists cite number studies purporting show widespread functionality things like transposons argue percentage much higher actually show biochemical activity transcription regulated based tissue type resulting rna trafficked specific places cell yeah cells let transcription happen rna wander around show actually something physiology cell oh done actually data well means business assigning selected function genome right also means numbers functional information across mammalian genomes made means everything argument falls apart amount information must generated rate must generated rate compares observed rates microbial evolution rests number made related species huge genomes onions example billion base pairs five times size human genome members genus billion amoeba dubia unicellular eukaryote half trillion much junk dna stuff junk mammals special right blows hole numbers means pack go home build argument numbers backing data ballgame amp nbsp problem second ecological contexts mammalian diversification microbial adaptation recent times completely different twice history mammals experienced event called adaptive radiation lot niche space e different resources available environment selection strongly favors adapting available niches rather competing already utilized resources favors new traits allow populations occupy previously unoccupied niches types natural selection work directional disruptive selection along adaptive selection overall effect selection dynamics selection novelty new traits means adaptive radiations evolution happening fast hitting gas first thing able get new resources wins microbial evolution exact opposite whether plasmodium adapting anti malarial drugs e coli lenski long term evolution experiment phages adapting novel host microbial populations single overarching selective pressure sometimes tens thousands hundreds thousands generations conditions see rapid adaption prevailing conditions followed sharp decline rate change populations rapidly reach fitness peak deviation less fit stabilizing purifying selection operating suppress novelty slowing rate evolution opposed directional disruptive adaptive mammals accelerate johnberea wants treat microbial rate speed limit hard cap beyond organisms go faulty first quantify rate oh wait okay done also type selection microbes experiencing going suppress rate evolve treating rate kind ceiling makes sense enough mammalian diversification involved exact opposite dynamics meaning see microbial populations relevant mammalian evolution way johnberea wants another blow number amp nbsp problem third evolution happen constant rates third leg rickety ass stool rates things evolving today representative rates evolved throughout history maybe something misunderstanding molecular clocks know notion evolution happens constant rate specific group organisms nuts yes even though explicitly stated must assumption argument otherwise one cannot jump fastest observed rates therefore happened fast enough past rates constant long timespans presently observed rates tell us nothing past rates argument falls apart yes even though stated outright constant rates time required particular creationist argument work sure nobody surprised hear evolution rates actually constant time sometimes fast like adaptive radiation sometimes slow like single population grows conditions thousands generations since rates change constant using present rates impose cap past rates especially ecological contexts different complete opposites valid argument another way line reasoning wrong amp nbsp much things addressing numbers care numbers matter context described number errors trivial enough makes difference could whole thread four sentences smaller errors like ignoring sexual recombination mutations larger single base substitutions including things like gene duplications necessarily double information content duplicated region extremely common animal evolution also undercut creationist argument super specific particular argument leave amp nbsp next time see argument mammalian evolution must happened millions times
